Stephen Palumbi : Following the mercury trail
And those simple themes aren ' t really themes about the complex science of what ' s going on , but things that we all pretty well know.
That ' s the theme of my talk.
We piled enormous amounts of pollution into the air and into the water.
You smell money. " 
The pyramid of ocean life ...
And that ' s what we ' re trying to preserve when we say ,  " Save the ocean . Heal the ocean. " 
Pollutants , some pollutants have been created by us : molecules like PCBs that can ' t be broken down by our bodies.
It ' s the Styrofoam and chocolate game.
What ' ll happen is that the Styrofoam peanuts will start moving through our society here , and they will accumulate in the drunkest , stingiest people.
Well , some of us would be eating those chocolates instead of passing them around , and instead of accumulating , they will just pass into our group here and not accumulate in any one group because they ' re absorbed by us.
PCBs accumulate in dolphins in Sarasota Bay , in Texas , in North Carolina.
And what ' s that ? 
Juveniles : a huge load.
The death rate in these dolphins , for the first calf born of every female dolphin , is 60 to 80 percent.
That top predator , of course , is us.
And some of those whale meat samples were whale meat.
Even though they were labeled whale meat , they were dolphin meat.
It turns out that a lot of dolphins are being sold as meat in the whale meat market around the world.
It had two-to-three-to-400 times the toxic loads ever allowed by the EPA.
That led to a whole series of other campaigns in Japan , and I ' m really proud to say that at this point , it ' s very difficult to buy anything in Japan that ' s labeled incorrectly , even though they ' re still selling whale meat , which I believe they shouldn ' t.
They cannot feed their offspring , their children , their breast milk because of the accumulation of these toxins in their food chain , in their part of the world ' s ocean pyramid.
We ' ve taken them out of their natural pyramid in order to solve this problem.
And if we jam nutrients , sewage , fertilizer in the base of that food pyramid , it can back up all through it.
How many people have seen a  " beach closed "  sign ? 
Now how many of you have ever gone to a state park or a national park where you had a big sign at the front saying ,  " Closed because human sewage is so far over this park that you can ' t use it "  ? 
It ' s not just a question of cleanliness ; it ' s also a question of how those organisms then turn into human disease.
Surfers , for example , know this incredibly.
These same infections create harmful algal blooms.
Rita Calwell very famously traced a very interesting story of cholera into human communities , brought there , not by a normal human vector , but by a marine vector , this copepod.
So what do you do ? 
You could call Joe the Plumber , for example.
I started out showing how much we had distressed the Monterey Bay ecosystem with pollution and the canning industry and all of the attendant problems.
But there ' s a greater sense here that what the individual communities need is working ecosystems.
It happened because many people put their time and effort and their pioneering spirit into this.
Other people , like David Packard and Julie Packard , who were instrumental in producing the Monterey Bay aquarium to lock into people ' s notion that the ocean and the health of the ocean ecosystem were just as important to the economy of this area as eating the ecosystem would be.
And it ' s only through having the ocean being healthy that we can remain healthy ourselves.

And so plants and animals developed their own internal clocks so that they would be ready for these changes in light.
And it ' s incredible to watch , but there ' s nothing psychic or paranormal going on ; it ' s simply that these crabs have internal cycles that correspond , usually , with what ' s going on around it.
People actually volunteer for this , and they usually come out kind of raving about their productive time in the hole.
So fine , we have a body clock , and it turns out that it ' s incredibly important in our lives.
So the culture , the northern aboriginal culture , traditionally has been highly seasonal.
What would our sleeping patterns be in the sort of ideal sense ? 
And in-between , they have a couple of hours of sort of meditative quiet in bed.
We ' re living in a culture of jet lag , global travel , 24-hour business , shift work.

Basil Jones : But actually we ' re going to start this evolution with a hyena.
The hyena is the ancestor of the horse because it was part of a production called  " Faustus in Africa, "  a Handspring Production from 1995 , where it had to play draughts with Helen of Troy.
BJ : One of them is breath , and it kind of breathes.
It ' s the thing that distinguishes the puppet -- AK : Oops.
AK : Yeah , it ' s basically a dead object , as you can see , and it only lives because you make it.
So we call this a piece of emotional engineering that uses up-to-the-minute 17th century technology -- to turn nouns into verbs.
BJ : And it has these bulkheads made out of plywood , covered with fabric -- curiously similar , in fact , to the plywood canoes that Adrian ' s father used to make when he was a boy in their workshop.
I really thought they were so beneath me.
And 20 years later , miraculously , we collaborated with a company from Mali , the Sogolon Marionette Troupe of Bamako , where we made a piece about a tall giraffe.
It ' s got two people inside it on stilts , which give them the height , and somebody in the front who ' s using a kind of steering wheel to move that head.
And just around that time , his mother had said ,  " Have you seen this book by Michael Morpurgo called  ' War Horse '  ?  " 
AK : It seemed a lovely idea.
But they agreed to go along with it for a while.
AK : And once we put Katherine through that particular brand of hell , we knew that we might be able to make a horse , which could be ridden.
BJ : And the two manipulators are inside.
And we had a crate built for it.
And we sent it off to the National Theatre , hoping that they believed that we created something that worked.
We opened the lid , we took the horse out , and it did work ; it walked and it was able to be ridden.
The choreographer , Toby Sedgwick , invented a beautiful sequence where the baby horse , which was made out of sticks and bits of twigs , grew up into the big horse.
Here is the plan.
There is very little 20th century technology in them.
And now we would like to introduce you to Joey.
Joey , come here.
AK : Joey , Joey , Joey , Joey.
Here , Craig is working the head.
The ears are obviously a very important emotional indicator of the horse.
It ' s almost more important than their eyesight.
Horses are so unpredictable.
And together , there ' s quite a complex possibility of tail expression.
But we realized that , if that were to be happening , you wouldn ' t , as an audience , see the breath.
AK : Other emotional stuff.
But of course , it was the cane is light , the cane is flexible , the cane is durable and the cane is moldable.
Or if you light it from above , it becomes more solid.
And it ' s very much an in-the-moment activity that they ' re engaged in.
Thank you.
The sound that that very large chest makes , of the horse -- the whinnying and the nickering and everything -- that starts usually with one performer , carries on with a second person and ends with a third.
http://www.ted.com/talks/katherine_fulton_you_are_the_future_of_philanthropy.html
Katherine Fulton : You are the future of philanthropy
We all know which side of these we ' d like to be on.
But by the end of the 20th century , a new generation of critics and reformers had come to see philanthropy just this way.
I ' ve been following this change for quite a while now , and participating in it.
And as I do that , I ' m not going to dwell much on the very large philanthropy that everybody already knows about -- the Gates or the Soros or the Google.
The first is mass collaboration , represented here by Wikipedia.
He said ,  " We have lived in this world where little things are done for love and big things for money.
The book is called  " Blessed Unrest. " 
Now , all of these big things for love -- experiments -- aren ' t going to take off.
Think of it as peer-to-peer philanthropy.
It ' s one of the best known of these new marketplaces where a donor can go straight into a classroom and connect with what a teacher says they need.
The third category is represented by Warren Buffet , which I call aggregated giving.
One of the best known is Acumen Fund , led by Jacqueline Novogratz , a TEDster who got a big boost here at TED.
Now , imagine for a second these first three types of experiments : mass collaboration , online marketplaces , aggregated giving.
I ' m going to look quickly at the fourth and fifth categories , which are innovation , competitions and social investing.
That leaves the final category , social investing , which is really , anyway , the biggest of them all , represented here by Xigi.net.
So we can look to these innovators to help us remember that if we can leverage even a small amount of the capital that seeks a return , the good that can be driven could be astonishing.
We have got to realize that it is going to take a long time to do these things.
And everywhere I go , including here at TED , I feel that there is a new moral hunger that is growing.
Whatever we call it , it ' s new , it ' s beginning , and I think it ' s gong to quite significant.
That ' s because our ability to confront the problems that we face has not kept pace with our ability to create them.
Our future doesn ' t have to be imagined.
We are going to need a new generation of citizen leaders willing to commit ourselves to growing and changing and learning as rapidly as possible.
And they were great community leaders.
And I want you to imagine that this a photograph of you.
What is the story you most want for them to tell ? 
680
And what do I mean by that ? 
And I asked them to come along with the person they communicate with most.
What we ' re actually going to see is that , fundamentally , people are communicating on a regular basis with five , six , seven of their most intimate sphere.
But he actually talks to , has two-way exchanges with , about four to six people on a regular base , depending on his gender.
A lot of sociologists actually are quite disappointed.
There are three stories that I think are quite good examples.
He just wants to wish her a good day , because that ' s the start of her day.
Then there is another couple , there is a Brazilian couple.
And I heard this story the first time a couple of years ago from a very modest family of immigrants from Kosovo in Switzerland.
They chat to each other every day , a few times a day actually.
And this is exactly what we ' ve been seeing with teenagers and kids doing it in school , under the table , and texting under the table to their friends.
So , think of the three settings I ' ve talked to you about : factory , migration , office.
If you were in management , oh , that was a different story.
And this has become such a norm of our professional lives , such a norm and such an expectation.
And this has become such a cultural norm that we actually school our children for them to be capable to do this cleavage.
And of course , the major thing : learn to pay attention , to concentrate and focus your attention.
And when with modern bureaucracy there was a very rational approach , where there was a clear distinction between the private sphere and the public sphere.
And if you think , it ' s permeated our whole culture , even our cities.
So the lower the status of the job and of the person carrying out , the more removed he would be from his personal sphere.
I really think that the number is conservative.
The point is that this re-appropriation of the personal sphere is not terribly successful with all institutions.

Majora Carter : 3 stories of local eco-entrepreneurship
Currently , taxpayers spend about 60,000 dollars per year sending a person to jail.
But Brenda , not being phased by stuff like that , took a look at her challenge and came up with a not-so-obvious solution : create a business that produces skin care products from honey.
She combined employment experience and training with life skills they needed , like anger-management and teamwork , and also how to talk to future employers about how their experiences actually demonstrated the lessons that they had learned and their eagerness to learn more.
Now , I ' m going to take you to Los Angeles , and lots of people know that L.A . has its issues.
Their spending loads , loads , to channel that rainwater out into the ocean when it rains and floods as well.
How you get it shouldn ' t make that much of a difference.
So ultimately , 20 million square feet of asphalt was replaced or avoided , and electrical consumption for air-conditioning went down , while employment for people to maintain those grounds went up , resulting in a net-savings to the system , but also healthier students and schools system employees as well.
But the way coal is mined right now is different from the deep mines that her father and her father ' s father would go down into and that employed essentially thousands and thousands of people.
Just imagine that the air surrounding these places -- it ' s filled with the residue of explosives and coal.
But she also saw the difference in potential wind energy on an intact mountain , and one that was reduced in elevation by over 2,000 feet.
Now mountaintop removal pays very little money to the locals , and it gives them a lot of misery.
Not quite an obvious alliance.
So homegirls and hillbillies we got it together and totally understand that this is what it ' s all about.
And I just find it so bizarre that she ' s suffering from the same thing that she tried so hard to protect people from.
That ' s what my homegirl is doing.
I was really lucky to have them all featured on my Corporation for Public Radio radio show called ThePromisedLand.org.
In fact , they make up some of what I call the most expensive citizens , and they include generationally impoverished , traumatized vets returning from the Middle East , people coming out of jail.
So these three guys all understand how to productively channel dollars through our local economies to meet existing market demands , reduce the social problems that we have now and prevent new problems in the future.
And where is this waste handled ?  Usually in poor communities.
Fortunately -- because we wanted to create hundreds of jobs -- but after many years , the city wanted to build a jail.
It relies too much on transportation , chemical fertilization , big use of water and also refrigeration.
Part of my work now is really laying the groundwork to integrate urban ag and rural food systems to hasten the demise of the 3,000-mile salad by creating a national brand of urban-grown produce in every city , that uses regional growing power and augments it with indoor growing facilities , owned and operated by small growers , where now there are only consumers.
The goal is to meet the cities '  institutional demands for hospitals , senior centers , schools , daycare centers , and produce a network of regional jobs , as well.
Smart infrastructure can provide cost-saving ways for municipalities to handle both infrastructure and social needs.
These examples indicate a trend.
It is an essential pillar to this country ' s recovery.
Now is the time for us to act in our own communities where we think local and we act local.
Hometown security means creating wealth here at home , instead of destroying it overseas.
Now , hometown security is about taking care of your own , but it ' s not like the old saying ,  " charity begins at home. " 
See , my dad was a great , great man in many ways.
To him that phrase ,  " Charity begins at home, "  meant that my payday -- or someone else ' s -- would just happen to coincide with his lucky day.
He made 15,000 dollars cash and bought the house that I grew up in.
To me , charity often is just about giving , because you ' re supposed to , or because it ' s what you ' ve always done , or it ' s about giving until it hurts.
And I know a little bit about these issues , because , for many years , I spent a long time in the non-profit industrial complex , and I ' m a recovering executive director , two years clean.
And I tell you , being on the TED stage and winning a MacArthur in the same exact year gave everyone the impression that I had arrived.
But I did in fact get married in it.
Since then , we got about 50 million dollars in stimulus package money to come and get here.
Hometown security is next on my to-do list.
It is time that we start building living monuments to hope and possibility.

My family was wealthy , and my father believed in one thing , and that was to give us all as much education as we wanted.
And he said  " If you go to MIT, "  to which I had been given early admission ,  " I will pay for every year you ' re at MIT , in graduate or undergraduate -- as much as you want -- I will pay for an equal number of years for you to live in Paris. " 
And I said to him what I was doing , that I was going to go study architecture because it was art and mathematics put together.
I studied architecture , then did a second degree in architecture , and then actually quickly realized that it wasn ' t architecture.
Something that would be important , but also something that would take advantage of all of these privileges that one had. " 
Didn ' t have to worry about what people thought about me.
It ' s about two weeks old . There they are , folks.
What happens is , they burn into flash memory the software , and then test them for a few hours.
This picture was taken in 1982 , just before the IBM PC was even announced.
I say to myself ,  " What planet do you come from ?  " 
What he observed was that kids who write computer programs understand things differently , and when they debug the programs , they come the closest to learning about learning.
This is being launched with three languages in it : Squeak , Logo , and a third , that I ' ve never even seen before.
And these kids had their laptops . But it was really what spirited this , plus the influence of Joe and others . We started One Laptop per Child.
And the reason being a nonprofit is important is actually twofold.
The clarity of purpose is absolutely critical . And the second is very counterintuitive -- you can get the best people in the world.
We couldn ' t afford to hire a CFO . We put out a job description for a CFO at zero salary , and we had a queue of people.
Everybody remembered the pencil-yellow crank . It ' s different.
You want a separate thing , like the AC adaptor.
That computer is unlike anything you ' ve had , and does things -- there are four of them -- that you don ' t come close to . And it ' s very important to be low power , and I hope that ' s picked up more by the industry.
And that was really critical . The mesh network , it ' ll become commonplace.
So , I didn ' t do that . But design matters for a number of reasons.
But if you take a different approach , and you think of very large-scale integration , very advanced materials , very advanced manufacturing -- so you ' re pouring chemicals in one end , iPods are spewing out the other -- and really cool design , that ' s what we wanted to do.
It wasn ' t just to kind of make it cute , because somebody -- you know , good design is very important.
It ' s a lot of stuff that goes behind these . These can talk to each other.
You don ' t call Verizon or Sprint . You build your own network.
I ' m willing to suspect some of you hadn ' t even heard of them before.
And this is the big difference.
So what I want to end with is sort of what we ' re doing to roll it out.
In the case of Qaddafi , he ' d do 1.2 million , and that they would launch it.
This was a period in my life where I was traveling 330 days per year.
And it was 45 degrees C . I mean , this was not what you ' d call a cool experience . And former countries -- I say former , because none of them really came through this summer -- there was a big difference between getting a head of state to have a photo opportunity , make a press release.
And guess what ?  We won it hands down.
The president of Ethiopia said he would do it.
We thought that was a good time to announce it.
The first day it was just wild . And then we said ,  " Well , let ' s get people to give many . Not just one , and get one , but maybe give 100 , give 1,000. "  And that ' s where you come in.
And it ' s not to go out and buy 100 or 1,000 , though , I invite you to do that , and 10,000 would be even better.
And if each one of you sends it to 300 or 400 people , that would be fantastic.
We ' ve pledged not to add features , but to bring that price down.
They went to Uruguay , Peru , Mexico.
And the world production today , everybody combined , making laptops , is five million a month . So I ' m standing here telling you that sometime next year , we ' re going to make 20 percent of the world production.
Britta Riley wanted to grow her own food  . So she and her friends developed a system for growing plants in discarded plastic bottles -- researching , testing and tweaking the system using social media , trying many variations at once and quickly arriving at the optimal system . Call it distributed DIY . And the results ?  Delicious.
I , like many of you , am one of the two billion people on Earth who live in cities.
A couple of years ago , I read an article by New York Times writer Michael Pollan in which he argued that growing even some of our own food is one of the best things that we can do for the environment.
So , I happen to know a little bit from my own work about how NASA has been using hydroponics to explore growing food in space.
Fast-forward two years later : we now have window farms , which are vertical , hydroponic platforms for food-growing indoors.
And I really wanted it to be an open project , because hydroponics is one of the fastest growing areas of patenting in the United States right now and could possibly become another area like Monsanto , where we have a lot of corporate intellectual property in the way of people ' s food.
And we were able to grow cherry tomatoes and cucumbers , all kinds of stuff.
So actually now on this website , we have 18,000 people.
So for example , Jackson came along and suggested that we use air pumps instead of water pumps.
So window farms have been evolving through a rapid versioning process similar to software.
So for do-it-yourselfers , we provide free , very well-tested instructions so that anyone , anywhere around the world , can build one of these systems for free.
In our culture , it is better to be a tester who supports someone else ' s idea than it is to be just the idea guy.
If we really want to see the kind of wide consumer behavior change that we ' re all talking about as environmentalists and food people , maybe we just need to ditch the term  " consumer "  and get behind the people who are doing stuff.
And we ' re looking ahead at generations who really need us to retool our lives now.
design,humanity,intelligence,robots,singularity,technology
And when I look out in the future , I can ' t imagine a world , 500 years from now , where we don ' t have robots everywhere.
Yeah , I think that ' s pretty likely -- there ' s going to be lots of robots everywhere.
And you know , the first computer most people had in the house may have been a computer to play Pong , a little microprocessor embedded , and then other games that came after that.
On the right there is another robot doll , who you could get a couple of years ago.
But nevertheless , those sorts of things are out there.
But at the bottom left , you see Electrolux , which is on sale.
We ' re going to give this away I think , Chris said , after the talk.
Now it ' s doing wall-following , it ' s following around my feet to clean up around me . Let ' s see , let ' s -- oh , who stole my Rice Krispies ?  They stole my Rice Krispies!
We ' ll just put some crap here.
Part of the trick was building a better cleaning mechanism , actually ; the intelligence on board was fairly simple.
It ' s a military surveillance robot , to go in ahead of troops -- looking at caves , for instance.
Okay , so it ' s doing local navigation there.
And the big breakthrough for these robots , really , was September 11th.
Let ' s run this video.
Okay , good.
The worst thing that ' s happened in the cave so far was one of the robots fell down ten meters.
There ' s a sea change happening in how -- where technology ' s going.
But robots like this , they ' re a little hard to program.
He sort of does that . But I ' m going to -- Chris Anderson : I ' m just British . RB : Oh.
So now I brought this up in front of him.
And so I do this task , and he looks , and he looks to me to see what ' s happening next . And now I ' ll give him the bottle , and we ' ll see if he can do the task . Can you do that ? 
And he thinks a robot has to be really slow.
The other thing communicates their internal state to us , whether he ' s understanding or not , regulates a social interaction.
The most important thing for building a robot that you can interact with socially is its visual attention system.
And it looks for things that move around.
And so these weights change.
Well , this gets rid of that , because this is a habituation Gaussian that gets negative , and more and more intense as it looks at one thing.
And it ' s got a little bit of an emotional response here.
And at different places in that space , it expresses -- can we have the volume on here ? 
RB : So it ' s expressing its emotion through its face and the prosody in its voice.
RB : And the robot ' s reacting appropriately.
These are naive subjects.
Voice : Kismet , do you like the toy ?  Oh.
RB : I ' m going to leave it at that.
And then they talk , and then we pass the baton back and forth between each other.
It was just saying random English phonemes.
We don ' t know whether he understood or not that the robot -- Notice the turn-taking.
RB : So it ' s making eye contact with him , following his eyes.
This is another robot , Cog.
And the other question people ask me is , will they want to take over ? 
But I think , you know , we have to accept that we are just machines.
It ' s all mechanistic . We are mechanism.
500 years ago we had to give up the idea that we are the center of the universe when the earth started to go around the sun ; 150 years ago , with Darwin , we had to give up the idea we were different from animals.
But we ' re going to come to accept it over the next 50 years or so.
And for those of you that have teenagers , you know what that ' s like.
I don ' t think that ' s going to happen.
And we ' re just not going to let it go that way.
economics,global issues,politics
He said , you know , there ' s this fiscal cliff coming , it ' s going to come at the beginning of 2013.
And it made me think . I love studying these moments in American history when there was this frenzy of partisan anger , that the economy was on the verge of total collapse.
This battle defined the first 150 years of the U.S . economy , and at every moment , different partisans saying ,  " Oh my God , the economy ' s about to collapse, "  and the rest of us just going about , spending our bucks on whatever it is we wanted to buy.
So I just call it the self-imposed , self-destructive arbitrary deadline about resolving an inevitable problem.
And at that moment our economy collapses.
The dark blue line is how much the government spends.
It gets really , really ugly out towards 2030.
The Republicans say , hey , no , no , we ' ve got a better idea.
And I like to think , when I picture how Republicans see the economy , what I picture is just some amazingly well-engineered machine , some perfect machine.
It ' s good to let markets move resources to their more productive use.
That ' s not going to create an equitable , fair society.
But here ' s what I learned.
When you look at how the federal government spends money , so this is the battle right here , 55 percent , more than half , is on Social Security , Medicare , Medicaid , a few other health programs , 20 percent defense , 19 percent discretionary , and six percent interest.
And they do not want it fundamentally touched , although the American people are remarkably comfortable , and Democrats roughly equal to Republicans , with some minor tweaks to make the system more stable.
Americans are about 50/50 , whether they ' re Democrats or Republicans.
Everyone hates that equally , but Republicans and Democrats hate that together.
Now there is one issue that is hyper-partisan , and where there is one party that is just spend , spend , spend , we don ' t care , spend some more , and that of course is Republicans when it comes to military defense spending.
I should also note that the [discretionary] spending , which is about 19 percent of the budget , that is Democratic and Republican issues , so you do have welfare , food stamps , other programs that tend to be popular among Democrats , but you also have the farm bill and all sorts of Department of Interior inducements for oil drilling and other things , which tend to be popular among Republicans.
So basically Republicans who make more than 250,000 dollars a year don ' t want to be taxed.
But that is not the case at all.
A tiny little sliver call themselves libertarians , or socialists , or some other small third party , and the largest block , 40 percent , say they ' re independents.
And in fact , there ' s this other group of people who are not as divided as people might think , and that group is economists.
It ' s still ugly to this day , but in my experience , it is really , really hard to find an economist under 40 who still has that kind of way of seeing the world.
And the data is very clear.
And this nonpartisanship is something that exists , that has existed in secret in America for years and years and years.
The vast majority of people , they pick and choose , they see compromise and they change over time when they hear a better argument or a worse argument.
 " Do you think government should "  — especially if you use loaded language --  " Do you think the government should provide handouts ?  " 
So what we have , then , when you think about the fiscal cliff , don ' t think of it as the American people fundamentally can ' t stand each other on these issues and that we must be ripped apart into two separate warring nations.
They don ' t represent what our views are.
In 1913 , we had this ugly battle over the Federal Reserve , when it was created , with vicious , angry arguments over how it would be constituted , and a general agreement that the way it was constituted was the worst possible compromise , a compromise guaranteed to destroy this valuable thing , this dollar , but then everyone agreeing , okay , so long as we ' re on the gold standard , it should be okay.
And nothing happened at all.
The fear is that the longer we delay any solution , the more the world will look to the U.S.
But the more we address it as a practical concern , the sooner we can resolve it , and the more time we have to resolve it , paradoxically.

And one day , one of his customers came into his workshop and asked him to clean the watch that he ' d bought.
And the watchmaker turned around and said ,  " God can see it. " 
And it was a physiological response.
You probably think , well , I don ' t know which one you think it is , but I think it ' s about feeling beauty.
Do you remember when lights used to just go on and off , click click , when you closed the door in a car ? 
Do you remember the first time you were in a car and it did that ? 
So I started to ask myself questions about it.
Can we cut down a little bit further , because , as a designer , I need the vocabulary , I need the keyboard , of how this actually works.
You see , using this bit , the thinky bit , the slow bit of the brain -- using that.
I don ' t need you to think so much as I want you to feel it.
And when that happens , are you sitting there going ,  " No , the movie ' s about to start, "  or are you going ,  " That ' s fantastic . I ' m looking forward to it.
But it might be.
So this leads me to think of this in a different way.
They arrive first.
It ' s a plastic bag.
Now I ' m going to ask you again to switch on the emotional bit.
I ' m watching your faces very carefully.
This is the last act on this Earth of a little girl called Heidi , five years old , before she died of cancer to the spine.
Is it beautiful now ? 
And I ' m watching your faces , because your faces are telling me something.
I watch faces.
And by the way , there ' s no pleasure in that face.
There ' s something else in that.
It means something triggering a big emotional response , often quite a sad emotional response , but it ' s part of what we do.
Pathos appears obviously as part of what you just saw in that little girl ' s drawing.
Now what I ' m also interested in is : Is it possible to separate intrinsic and extrinsic beauty ? 
So a lot of it tends to be extrinsic.
And one of the most tedious ones , I think , was saying that beauty was about symmetry.
So it wasn ' t about symmetry.
Now I can feel a sensation of delight and beauty if I look at that eye.
And as I say , I ' m not a neuroscientist , but to understand how I can start to assemble things that will very quickly bypass this thinking part and get me to the enjoyable precognitive elements.
Ahhhh.
This is just the bit that protrudes into our physical dimension.
So that ' s getting me excited.
Now that thing , light flickers across it as you move , so it becomes a kinetic object , even though it ' s standing still -- managed by how brilliantly that ' s done on the reflection.
I can ' t tell you how wonderful this is.
So it disappears.
So it ' s more expensive , but it ' s wonderful.
They call him  " The Plumber "  in Italy , as well as  " Maestro, "  because he actually is engineer and craftsman and sculptor at the same time.
So I have to work with a supply chain , and I ' ve got to work with the technologies , and I ' ve got to work with everything else all the time , and so compromises start to fit into it.
No one ' s noticed , have they yet ? 
Beautiful ?  Maybe lesser.
No one ' s going to notice those split lines and changes.
And a team rarely can do it.
It ' s lovely because it is an embodiment of something refreshing and delicious.
So all hail to that.
You all , I guess , like me , enjoy watching a ballet dancer dance.
While she ' s doing these graceful arabesques and plies and what have you , something horrible ' s going on down here.
So we ' re going to have a little experiment.
It ' s not.
And because your brain starter motor began there , now it ' s got to deal with it.
But you ' re a slave of that first flash.
And finally , the layer that I love , of knowledge.
It ' s fantastic , isn ' t it ? 
That ' s how underpaid younger-aged people have to fold your T-shirt.
The knowledge bubble that sits around the outside , the stuff that costs nothing , because that knowledge is free -- bundle that together and where do we come out ? 
It informs , it tells us , it supplies us answers before we ' ve even thought about it.
And you know what those products and services are , because you own some of them.
Brewster Kahle is building a truly huge digital library -- every book ever published , every movie ever released , all the strata of web history .. . It ' s all free to the public -- unless someone else gets to it first.
We really need to put the best we have to offer within reach of our children.
I ' m going to start and end this talk with a couple things that are carved in stone.
I ' m a librarian , and what I ' m trying to do is bring all of the works of knowledge to as many people as want to read it.
The problem was you actually had to go to Alexandria to go to it.
So if I ' m successful , then you ' ll actually come away thinking , yeah , we could actually achieve the great vision of everything ever published , everything that was ever meant for distribution , available to anybody in the world that ' s ever wanted to have access to it.
And the way I ' m going to try to do this is do it like the Amazon.com website , the books , music , video and just go step -- media type by media type , just go and say , all right , how ' re we doing on this ? 
Well , we don ' t really know , but the largest print library in the world is the Library of Congress . It ' s 26 million volumes , 26 million volumes.
26 terabytes fits in a computer system that ' s about this big , on spinning Linux drives , and it costs about 60,000 dollars.
You know , is it worth trying to get there ? 
And you can get at them remotely , if you happen to have a laptop.
I don ' t have to feel like I ' m at work to read a Kindle.
And I think we can go and use our technology to go and digitize things , put them on the Net , and then download , print them and bind them , and end up with books again.
And a bookmobile -- the size of a van with a satellite dish , a printer , binder and cutter , and kids make their own books.
So the idea of -- this technology actually may end up putting books back in people ' s hands again.
In India , they ' ve got another couple bookmobiles running around.
So the idea of being able to use this technology to end up with paper where I can handle sort of sounds a little retro , but I think it still has its place.
And it actually -- so technologically , it works.
And so we ' ve tried that , and I ' ll go over that in a moment.
It ' s all conveyor belt , and it makes a book.
And I don ' t mean to steal any thunder here , but we ' ve gone and used one of these things to be an e-book reader.
We ' re in good enough shape.
So we thought , okay , well , let ' s try out this send books to India thing.
And then we learned why you don ' t want to send books to India.
But do things that you love.
How do we go and do this , and how do we get it down so that it ' s a cost point that we could afford ? 
And we tried these robot things , and they worked pretty well -- sort of these auto-page-turning things.
So you basically do a beautiful , respectful job.
And actually , it turns out to , you know , pay a living wage.
We actually have been able to do a pretty good job of this , at getting 10 cents a page.
And what we ' ve been able to do is get into libraries.
The thing we ' re missing is the 10 cents.
So all in all , that ' s going very well.
And so we ' re starting up a program to do out-of-print works , but loaning them.
We ' re also going back over microfilm and getting that online.
Yes , it costs tens of millions , low hundreds of millions , but one time shot and we ' ve got basically the history of printed literature online.
So how much is there ? 
This is a fairly heavily litigated area , so we ' ve found that there are niches in the music world that aren ' t served terribly well by the classic commercial publishing system.
If you put up a video of your garage band , and it starts getting heavily accessed , you can lose your guitars or your house.
The rock  ' n '  rollers had a tradition of sharing , as long as nobody made any money . You could -- concert recordings , it ' s not the commercial recordings , but concert recordings , started by the Grateful Dead.
So audio is possible to put up , but the rights issues are really pretty thorny.
But half of those were Indian.
We ' ve found , also , a lot of political films , a lot of amateur films , all sorts of things that are basically needing a home , a permanent home.
Television comes quite a bit larger.
We only put one week up , which is mostly for cost reasons , which is the 9/11 , sort of from 9/11/2001 . For one week , what did the world see ? 
And television is dreadfully unrecorded and unquotable , except by Jon Stewart , who does a fabulous job.
So we ' ve got about 100,000 pieces up there.
Well , we ' re best known as the World Wide Web.
And it ' s been growing along for the last 11 years , and it ' s a fantastic resource.
Mostly , people want to see their old stuff out of this.
And we now have also another copy building up in Amsterdam.
There ' s a political and social question out of this.
What ' s the role of the public versus the private as things go forward ? 
And as I said before , I ' ll end with something that ' s carved above the door of the Carnegie Library.
exploration,journalism,science,technology,universe
My own interest in this subject , and my passion for it , began rather accidentally.
And I was left with this intense feeling of awe and exhilaration at the universe and our own ability to understand as much as we do.
So it took me from places like Chile -- the Atacama Desert in Chile -- to Siberia , to underground mines in the Japanese Alps , in Northern America , all the way to Antarctica and even to the South Pole.
All the theories in physics that we have today properly explain what is called normal matter -- the stuff that we ' re all made of -- and that ' s four percent of the universe.
I will take you first to an underground mine in Northern Minnesota where people are looking for something called dark matter.
And I went to see one of these experiments , and this is actually -- you can barely see it , and the reason for that is it ' s entirely dark in there -- this is a cavern that was left behind by the miners who left this mine in 1960.
This is one of the largest underground labs in the world.
And neutrinos you can detect by the signature they leave when they hit water molecules.
And where in the world would you find such water ? 
It ' s about 40 to 50 km wide in most places , and one to two kilometers deep.
The lake is entirely frozen.
So this is the Russians working on the ice in the peak of the Siberian winter.
I still don ' t understand this one Russian man working in his bare chest , but that tells you how hard he was working.
It ' s very harsh conditions.
From Siberia to the Atacama Desert in Chile , to see something called The Very Large Telescope.
But nonetheless , it ' s an extraordinary piece of engineering.
And one piece of engineering that I want to leave you with as regards this telescope is the mirror.
Here ' s another view of the same.
I want to spend most of my time on this part of the world.
And that ' s where they do their experiments , and then the balloon , the payload , is brought down.
And I don ' t know if you can read the lettering , but it says ,  " Ivan the Terribus. " 
This hut was built by Robert Falcon Scott and his men when they first came to Antarctica on their first expedition to go to the South Pole.
I was here to see the launch of this particular type of instrument.
And the engineers , the technicians , the physicists have all got to assemble on the Ross Ice Shelf , because Antarctica -- I won ' t go into the reasons why -- but it ' s one of the most favorable places for doing these balloon launches , except for the weather.
And that process takes about two hours.
Now , in case the weather changes before the launch , they have to actually pack everything back up into their boxes and take it out back to McMurdo Station.
And if they have to pack it back , they have to put it into boxes and stamp on it so that it fits into the box again -- except , when they did it first , it would have been done in Texas.
Here ' s a scene that shows you the balloon and the payload end-to-end.
And I would like to share with you a launch.
And the thing I want you to look at here is the telescope on the right-hand side.
One is exploring the cosmos on the outside , and the other one is exploring our interior being.
http://www.ted.com/talks/paul_stamets_on_6_ways_mushrooms_can_save_the_world.html
Paul Stamets on 6 ways mushrooms can save the world
I often wondered , if there was a United Organization of Organisms -- otherwise known as  " Uh-Oh "  -- -- and every organism had a right to vote , would we be voted on the planet , or off the planet ? 
This holds up to 30,000 times its mass.
Dusty and I , we like to say , on Sunday , this is where we go to church.
When I mention mushrooms to somebody , they immediately think Portobellos or magic mushrooms , their eyes glaze over , and they think I ' m a little crazy.
Day 21 , day 23 , day 25.
We share in common the same pathogens.
But I propose to you that the sequence of microbes that occur on rotting mushrooms are essential for the health of the forest.
In a single cubic inch of soil , there can be more than eight miles of these cells.
I ' ve been a scanning electron microscopist for many years , I have thousands of electron micrographs , and when I ' m staring at the mycelium , I realize that they are microfiltration membranes.
And I present to you a concept that these are extended neurological membranes.
And so the spongy soil not only resists erosion , but sets up a microbial universe that gives rise to a plurality of other organisms.
The mycelium is sentient.
The Earth invented the computer Internet for its own benefit , and we now , being the top organism on this planet , are trying to allocate resources in order to protect the biosphere.
Most of you may not know that fungi were the first organisms to come to land.
Makes the rocks crumble , and the first step in the generation of soil.
This was first discovered in 1859.
It was called Prototaxites.
Across the landscapes of Earth were dotted these giant mushrooms.
The Earth was struck by an asteroid , a huge amount of debris was jettisoned into the atmosphere.
So , the prospect of fungi existing on other planets elsewhere , I think , is a forgone conclusion , at least in my own mind.
How is it that this organism can be so large , and yet be one cell wall thick , whereas we have five or six skin layers that protect us ? 
Battelle Laboratories and I joined up in Bellingham , Washington.
These are the same bonds that hold hydrocarbons together.
Some of these mushrooms are very happy mushrooms.
They sporulated , the spores attract insects , the insects laid eggs , eggs became larvae.
The entire pile was a green berm of life.
And I ' ll show you a graph here.
Think of the implications.
It ' s a mushroom exclusive to the old-growth forest that Dioscorides first described in 65 A.D.
This is extremely rare fungus.
I ' ve been involved with the U.S . Defense Department BioShield program.
Dr . Earl Kern , who ' s a smallpox expert of the U.S . Defense Department , states that any compounds that have a selectivity index of two or more are active.
Or you can go to NPR.org and listen to a live interview.
Here ' s the selectivity index numbers -- against pox , you saw 10s and 20s -- now against flu viruses , compared to the ribavirin controls , we have an extraordinarily high activity.
I then think that we can make the argument that we should save the old-growth forest as a matter of national defense.
I did something that nobody else had done.
And so the industry has spent over 100 million dollars specifically on bait stations to prevent termites from eating your house.
One week later , I had no sawdust piles whatsoever.
So , you have a near-permanent solution for reinvasion of termites.
I then received my second patent -- and this is a big one.
This could totally revamp the pesticide industries throughout the world.
The seeds then are mothered by this mycelium.
You could take a cardboard box delivering shoes , you could add water -- I developed this for the refugee community -- corns , beans and squash and onions.
I add mycelium to it , and then I inoculate the corncobs.
The mushrooms then are harvested , but very importantly , the mycelium has converted the cellulose into fungal sugars.
But to go from cellulose to ethanol is ecologically unintelligent , and I think that we need to be econologically intelligent about the generation of fuels.

Stacey Kramer : The best gift I ever survived
So envision what it looks like all wrapped up.
Adoration and admiration will overwhelm you.
You ' ll have unsurpassed vitality and energy.
Flowers will arrive by the truckload.
Your life will have new meaning.
By now I know you ' re dying to know what it is and where you can get one.
Not likely.
It was a rare gem -- a brain tumor , hemangioblastoma -- the gift that keeps on giving.
It profoundly altered my life in ways I didn ' t expect in all the ways I just shared with you.
adventure,biosphere,biotech,climate change,environment,space
Of course we all here in this room live in Biosphere 1.
So what did I learn ?  Well , here I am inside Biosphere 2 , making a pizza.
Here in Biosphere 1 , well it takes me about two minutes , because I pick up the phone and I call and say ,  " Hey , can you deliver the pizza ?  " 
We had a savanna , a marsh , a desert.
I mean , what is a biosphere ? 
This is a chamber that was 1/400th the size of Biosphere 2 that we called our Test Module.
But by 1991 we finally had this thing built.
Big questions.
Let ' s take it on a maiden voyage.
And this is the world that we lived in.
This is the agriculture.
And I don ' t mean that in an abstract sense ; I mean it rather literally.
In fact , we ate so many sweet potatoes I became orange with sweet potato.
And we knew that we were losing CO2.
We were taking their biomass , storing them in the basement , growing plants , going around , around , around , trying to take all of that carbon out of the atmosphere.
But our oxygen was going down faster than our CO2 was going up , which was quite unexpected , because we had seen them going in tandem in the test module.
And I tell you , when you lose a lot of oxygen -- and our oxygen went down quite far ; it went from 21 percent down to 14.2 percent -- my goodness , do you feel dreadful.
And that you literally do that . You stop breathing and then you -- -- take a breath and it wakes you up . And it ' s very irritating.
We ' re not dead . We ' re fine . We ' re fine. " 
And it was time for us to put oxygen in.
Not me , that was for sure.
Essentially it had done something very simple.
So at the end of the two years when we came out , we were elated , because , in fact , although you might say we had discovered something that was quite  " uhh, "  when your oxygen is going down , stopped working , essentially , in your life support system , that ' s a very bad failure.
People , on the other hand , was a different subject.
For two years I ' d been seeing people through the glass.
We stink of hairspray and underarm deodorant , and all kinds of stuff.
I had been growing all my own food.
People must have thought I was nuts.
So I went about my business : Paragon Space Development Corporation , a little firm I started with people while I was in the Biosphere , because I had nothing else to do.
And I ' m also proud to announce that you ' re getting a sneak preview -- on Friday we ' re going to announce that we ' re actually forming a team to develop a system to grow plants on the Moon , which is going to be pretty fun.
Eritrea , formerly part of Ethiopia , is one of those places that is astonishingly beautiful , incredibly stark , and I have no understanding of how people eke out a living there.
I saw a company that had taken seawater and sand , and they were growing a kind of crop that will grow on pure salt water without having to treat it.
And the mangroves were providing wood and honey and leaves for the animals , so that they could produce milk and whatnot , like we had in the Biosphere.
They also pollute their next-door neighbors.
They had created an industrial ecosystem , of a sense.
When I ' m modeling a plant in a box , literally , I know where to draw the boundary.
And put your project in that context.
And those beautiful wispy clouds are , in fact , fires , human-made fires.
And I think often times people get lost in that.
This is the story of a rake in my backyard.
And on Sunday morning the neighbors leaf blower comes out , and I want to throttle them.
And I let all of the leaves fall from the trees that I have on my property.
And I have an oasis.
The small stuff counts.
But we can look at the world , and try to understand where we are in its context , and how we choose to interact with it.
Take a breath now.
It also connects us in time.
Our medical systems are broken . Doctors are capable of extraordinary treatments , but they are losing their core focus : actually treating people . Doctor and writer Atul Gawande suggests we take a step back and look at new ways to do medicine -- with fewer cowboys and more pit crews.
I got my start in writing and research as a surgical trainee , as someone who was a long ways away from becoming any kind of an expert at anything.
I had to think about how I sew and how I cut , but then also how I pick the right person to come to an operating room.
The political fight that we ' ve developed has become one around whether it ' s the government that ' s the problem or is it insurance companies that are the problem.
I want to take you back to a time when Lewis Thomas was writing in his book ,  " The Youngest Science. " 
If you were in a hospital , he said , it was going to do you good only because it offered you some warmth , some food , shelter , and maybe the caring attention of a nurse.
And there were a few.
Beyond these sorts of things , a medical doctor didn ' t have a lot that they could do.
You set the fracture , you drew the blood , you spun the blood , looked at it under the microscope , you plated the culture , you injected the antiserum.
Go a couple generations forward to where we are , though , and it looks like a completely different world.
But we can make it possible for most.
And we ' re trying to deploy this capability , town by town , to every person alive -- in our own country , let alone around the world.
And in the year 1970 , it took just over two full-time equivalents of clinicians.
Everyone just has a piece of the care.
There ' s evidence all around us : 40 percent of our coronary artery disease patients in our communities receive incomplete or inappropriate care.
There ' s another sign that we need pit crews , and that ' s the unmanageable cost of our care.
When you go from a world where you treated arthritis with aspirin , that mostly didn ' t do the job , to one where , if it gets bad enough , we can do a hip replacement , a knee replacement that gives you years , maybe decades , without disability , a dramatic change , well is it any surprise that that $40,000 hip replacement replacing the 10-cent aspirin is more expensive ? 
And vice versa , the best care often turns out to be the least expensive -- has fewer complications , the people get more efficient at what they do.
But when we look at the positive deviants -- the ones who are getting the best results at the lowest costs -- we find the ones that look the most like systems are the most successful.
It ' s a terrible design strategy actually.
A very expensive pile of junk that does not go anywhere.
Skill number one is the ability to recognize success and the ability to recognize failure.
He got interested in this because there had been government reports , newspaper reports , journal articles saying that there had been too many CT scans done.
It took him three months.
Which brings us to skill number two a system has.
The volume of surgery had spread around the world , but the safety of surgery had not.
And so we looked at what other high-risk industries do.
We got the lead safety engineer for Boeing to help us.
You have to think about things like pause points.
An aviation checklist , like this one for a single-engine plane , isn ' t a recipe for how to fly a plane , it ' s a reminder of the key things that get forgotten or missed if they ' re not checked.
And we had a mix of dumb stuff on there -- making sure an antibiotic is given in the right time frame because that cuts the infection rate by half -- and then interesting stuff , because you can ' t make a recipe for something as complicated as surgery.
We found that after they adopted it the complication rates fell 35 percent.
And that brings us to skill number three , the ability to implement this , to get colleagues across the entire chain to actually do these things.
Just using a checklist requires you to embrace different values from the ones we ' ve had , like humility , discipline , teamwork.
How did you do that ? 
And it seemed like time that we become that way ourselves.
And we ' ve come to a place where we have no choice but to recognize , as individualistic as we want to be , complexity requires group success.
animals,disease,food,insects,life,nature
Now , chances are that over the last winter , if you had been a beehive , either you or one of the two people you just nodded at would have died.
And most of those losses are because of things we know.
And one documentary writer , who was here and looked at this two months after I was here , described this not as beehives but as a graveyard , with these empty white boxes with no bees left in them.
In some cases , and in fact in most cases in one year , this flu was caused by a new virus to us , or newly identified by us , called Israeli Acute Paralysis virus.
And we don ' t have the answer to that yet , and we spend a lot of time trying to figure that out.
Now of course , if you lose a lot of colonies , beekeepers can replace them very quickly.
And then the one half that doesn ' t have a queen , they can buy a queen.
And you can install this in your hive and replace that dead-out.
And it ' s really important to talk about beekeepers first , because beekeepers are among the most fascinating people you ' ll ever meet.
And these tend to be some of the most independent , tenacious , intuitive , you know , inventive people you will ever meet.
I mean , there may be 100 explanations for why Haiti is the impoverished nation it is , but there is no excuse to see that sort of squalor.
We also have Dave Hackenberg , who is the poster child of CCD.
The ancient Egyptians used to move bees up and down the Nile on rafts , so this idea of a movable bee force is not new at all.
And that ' s important for many fronts , and one of them is because of that culture that ' s in agriculture.
And then 20 miles down the road is Groveland , and that ' s where all the Wisconsin beekeepers go.
And we see these families , these nomadic families , you know , father to son , father to son , and these guys are hurting.
Of course , the real importance for bees is not the honey.
Now , I want to just illustrate that in the fact that if we look at the breakfast I had yesterday morning -- a little cranberry juice , some fruits , some granola , I should have had whole wheat bread , I realized , but you know , jam on my Wonderbread , and some coffee -- and had we taken out all those ingredients , -- except for the almonds I wasn ' t going to pick out from the granola -- if we had taken out all those ingredients the bees had indirectly or directly pollinated , we wouldn ' t have much on our plate.
They get paid by pollen and nectar , to move that male sperm , the pollen , from flower to flower.
When they ' re out pollinating or gathering pollen from one flower , they stay to that crop exclusively , in order to help generate.
Honeybees are not native to America ; they were introduced with the colonialists.
Thirty-two species have not been identified or found in the state since 1950.
We also have the sweat bees , and these are little gems flying around.
What these bees do is , they sit there . These solitary bees , they drill a hole in the ground or drill a hole in a branch , and they collect pollen and make it into a ball , and they lay an egg on it.
And in fact , if you guys live on the West Coast , go to these websites here , and they ' re really looking for people to look for some of these bumblebees , because we think some have gone extinct . Or some , the population has declined.
And I ' m glad I ' m a bee man and not a bat man , because there ' s no money to research the bat problems.
And so that ' s incredible . And there ' s no money to do that.
And I think that there is an easy cure for NDD.
And if we look at the history of lawns , it ' s actually rather tragic.
And so it ' s incredible the amount of resources we ' ve spent keeping our lawns , which are these useless biosystems.
I think that there is perhaps some advantage to keeping lawns at a limited scale , and I think we ' re encouraged to do that.
And this is a companion , and this is a relationship that never dries up.
Bees apparently , can be the gateway to , you know , other things.
And if we want to cure ourselves of NDD , or Nature Deficit Disorder , I think this is a great way of doing it.
And I hope that you experience it and I hope you tell me about it one day.

I found this observation test about the story of the ark.
Some of them are about the animals , the number.
Noah needed to take two of every kind of bird , of every kind of animal , of every kind of creature that moves , but no mention about plants.
That is a point that is not coming out from the Bible , but it ' s something that really accompanied humanity.
We have the animals that are able to live and to sense , and on the top of the pyramid , there is the man.
But it ' s something completely wrong.
Just to give you an example , every single root apex is able to detect and to monitor concurrently and continuously at least 15 different chemical and physical parameters.
We have David Attenborough.
The blue whale , the biggest creature that exists on the planet -- that is wrong , completely wrong.
They have just a kind of very low-level soul.
This is a very fast movement.
But plants are also able to show a lot of movement.
Look at this young bean that is moving to catch the light every time.
They are training themselves , as many young animals do , to the adult life where they will be called to track the sun all the day.
So during the night , they curl the leaves and reduce the movement , and during the day , you have the opening of the leaves -- there is much more movement.
It ' s a kind of vegetarian experimentation.
They communicate with plants of other species and they communicate with animals by producing chemical volatiles , for example , during the pollination.
This is a serious business.
How is it possible to do this without a brain ? 
In his book , assisted by his son , Francis -- who was the first professor of plant physiology in the world , in Cambridge -- they took into consideration every single movement for 500 pages.
He wrote some very interesting letters to one of his friends who was J.D . Hooker , or at that time , president of the Royal Society , so the maximum scientific authority in Britain speaking about the brain in the plants.
So we studied the root apex and we found that there is a specific region that is here , depicted in blue -- that is called the  " transition zone. " 
Now we know that a root apex has just a few hundred cells that show this kind of feature , but we know how big the root apparatus of a small plant , like a plant of rye.
Here were have on the left , the Internet and on the right , the root apparatus.
Because they evolved for the same reason : to survive predation.
So , a suggestion for the people working with networks : plants are able to give you good suggestions about how to evolve networks.
We have the animaloid -- and the normal robots inspired by animals , insectoid , so on.
But if you want to explore soils , or if you want to colonize new territory , to best thing that you can do is to be inspired by plants that are masters in doing this.
It ' s much more easy to work with plants than with animals.
Well , thank you for your attention.
entertainment,live music,music,performance
That was whistling.
My dad was always whistling around the house , and I just thought that ' s part of communication in my family.
I whistled on [my] bike . I whistled everywhere.
So  " Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer "  -- you know it ? 
And I just couldn ' t.
I would love to , but why ? 
And I would have lost my face.
And she thought ,  " He will never go there. " 
That was great fun , of course.
So what happened now is I ' m standing here in Rotterdam , in the beautiful city , on a big stage , and I ' m talking about whistling.
Okay , I ' m not the only one whistling here.
Why ?  Can I go away ?  " 
It ' s about 80 minutes long.
Sorry . I forgot one thing.
This is very promising.
I ' m so sorry , technicians.
Okay.
Geert Chatrou : Thank you . Thank you.

So the first project we ' re going to take a look at is the very first No Pants Subway Ride.
She ' s being filmed with a hidden camera.
And that ' s me right there in a brown coat.
And as you ' ll see now , I ' m not wearing pants.
So she ' s noticed the unusual thing , but she ' s gone back to her normal life.
And we ' ll act as if it ' s just an unfortunate mistake we ' ve made , forgetting our pants on this cold January day.
They think this is the funniest thing they ' ve ever seen before.
So the train is now pulling into the third stop along the 6 line.
At the eighth stop , a girl came in with a giant duffel bag and announced she had pants for sale for a dollar -- like you might sell batteries or candy on the train.
And watching that videotape later that day inspired me to keep doing what I do.
And we ' ve continued to do it every year.
So I could do more large-scale projects.
After about 15 seconds , her friend appeared -- she had been hiding behind a display -- and they laughed and hugged each other and ran away.
So this project is called Look Up More . We had 70 actors dress in black.
The first signal was for everybody to hold up these four-foot tall letters that spelled out  " Look Up More, "  the name of the project.
And then we had dance solos where only one person would dance and everybody would point to them.
And I was standing just anonymously in a sweatshirt , putting my hand on and off of a trashcan to signal the advancement.
The next project I want to show was given to me in an email from a stranger.
So here ' s the video.
There was an eight year-old girl , a 10 year-old girl.
But also , don ' t shop.
The lower level employees thought it was very funny.
You can see them in this footage.
And you can see the cops in this footage right here.
So we had been there for 20 minutes ; we were happy to exit the store.
So I like that concept of using their own technology against them.
And it ' s a very depressing place to be in the morning , it ' s very crowded.
It ' s very cold outside.
So there ' s a photograph that illustrates it a little bit better.
And you know , not everybody ' s going to like everything you do , and I ' ve certainly developed a thick skin thanks to Internet comments , but that one ' s always bothered me , because we don ' t have too much time on our hands.
And of course they don ' t.
You know , as kids , we ' re taught to play.
It ' s that there is no point and that there doesn ' t have to be a point.

Dan Dennett ' s response to Rick Warren
Have they put up the wrong slide ?  " 
This is Technology , Entertainment , Design and there ' s a dairy cow.
And you might say ,  " Well , God designed the cow. " 
And it was designed by natural selection , the process of natural selection , over many millions of years.
Now why am I talking about cows ? 
They have evolved over millennia.
Because what I ' ve been doing for the last four years , really since the first time you saw me -- some of you saw me at TED when I was talking about religion , and in the last four years I ' ve been working just about non-stop on this topic.
I want to say , no , religions are an important natural phenomenon.
And , as with the cow , there ' s a mixture of evolutionary design , designed by natural selection itself , and intelligent design -- more or less intelligent design -- and redesigned by human beings who are trying to redesign their religions.
And it ' s one that echoes remarks that you ' ve heard already today.
And this should be presented factually , straightforwardly , with no particular spin , to all of the children in the country.
But also let them know about other religions.
Misinformed consent is not worth it.
Now , children below the age of consent are a special case.
You have a responsibility to the world , to the state , to them , to take care of them right.
It strikes me as practically libertarian.
No values , just facts about all the world ' s religions.
I know many religions are so anxious about preserving the purity of their faith among their children that they are intent on keeping their children ignorant of other faiths.
This picture , which I pulled off the web -- the fellow on the left is really an important part of this picture.
They depend on us for their survival.
How clever it was of sheep to acquire shepherds!
What a deal.
It wasn ' t the cleverness of the sheep at all.
It was a clever move of natural selection itself.
Evolution is cleverer than you are.
But the process itself is without purpose , without foresight , without design.
It was sort of a spooky story.
They ' re not really bright . They don ' t have to be.
That ' s the way evolution works.
Here ' s what he said.
What is it today ?  Does anybody remember what he told us ? 
I wanted to check to find out how he ' d calculated this , and get the sources and so forth.
Suddenly , we humans , a recently arrived species no longer subject to the checks and balances inherent in nature , have grown in population , technology and intelligence to a position of terrible power.
And we ' re the ones that hold the paintbrush.
They would be puzzled by many things.
Here ' s a big crowd.
Actually , I ' m going to pass over this.
And it turns the mouse into Mighty Mouse -- it makes it fearless , so it runs out in the open , where it ' ll be eaten by a cat.
Yes , it does -- quite wonderfully.
I ' m talking also about Christianity.
Same idea! Well , not quite.
Surrendered people obey God ' s words , even if it doesn ' t make sense. " 
You ' ve all got a copy.
And you heard just now what the goal is.
He ' s absolutely right.
Yes.
This is a fantastic achievement.
I don ' t have to tell you this.
I really appreciated that.
That ' s really important.
Because I ' m absolutely sincere in my appreciation of all that I ' ve said about this book.
I wish he could do this with a revision , a Mark 2 version of his book.
That ' s worth mentioning.
There would be no right or wrong and no hope beyond your brief years on Earth. " 
We don ' t need a belief in God to be good or to have meaning in us.
I ' m afraid that a lot of people take that sentiment to mean that we don ' t have to do the sorts of things that Al Gore is trying so hard to get us to do.
And here I think ,  " Wait a minute. " 
And you can ' t tell.
And I think that thinking this way about the history of the planet , after we ' ve just been hearing about the history of the planet over millions of years , discourages people from scientific understanding.
I think that ' s false.
Well , it would be interesting to find the interpretation where I would accept that.
And what I find deeply troubling in this book is that he seems to be arguing that if you want to be moral , if you want to have meaning in your life , you have to be an Intelligent Designer -- you have to deny the theory of evolution by natural selection.
Well maybe , OK , but what ' s going to follow from this ? 
 " Don ' t ever argue with the Devil.
It ' s a very clever adaptation of religions.
Don ' t listen , don ' t listen!
And I ' d really like to get a response if Rick is able to do it.
It simply shows the religions of the world.
I found this sign as I was driving to Maine recently , in front of a church --  " Good without God becomes zero. " 
If you are like me , you know many wonderful , committed , engaged atheists , agnostics , who are being very good without God.
Thanks very much for your attention.

And not knowing where help was needed always ensured that help was in short supply in the areas that needed it most.
And it ignores the fact that , in the meanwhile , people still need to drink water.
We think there ' s a simpler solution to this problem -- one that can be used by people who face conditions like this everyday.
It doesn ' t require any special training.
This will make it possible for anyone to collect life-saving information and to monitor water quality conditions as they unfold.
And then , instead of taking days to disseminate this information to the people who need it most , it can happen automatically.

Julian Treasure : Shh! Sound health in 8 steps
Every part of your body is vibrating at different frequencies.
Incidentally , we see just one octave.
The loudest sound you can hear is a trillion times more powerful than that.
For example , have you ever considered that there are listening positions , places you can listen from ? 
Men typically listen reductively.
Expansive listening , on the other hand , is listening  " with, "  not listening  " for. " 
Men , if you get nothing else out of this talk , practice expansive listening , and you can transform your relationships.
Noise kills 200,000 people a year in Europe.
It looks a bit like this.
So , we ' re inviting into our lives the voices of people who are not present with us.
Listen to this -- this is an uncompressed piece of music.
It makes you tired and irritable to have to make up all of that data.
Ten million Americans already have this for one reason or another , but really worryingly , 16 percent -- roughly one in six -- of American teenagers suffer from noise-induced hearing disorder as a result of headphone abuse.
I ' ll give you three quick tips to protect your ears and pass these on to your children , please.
And thirdly , if you ' re in bad sound , it ' s fine to put your fingers in your ears or just move away from it.
Seek those sounds out ; they ' re good for you and so it this.
Have a foreground , a background , all in beautiful proportion.
I ' m going to just run quickly through eight modalities , eight ways sound can improve health.
It ' s been around for thousands of years.
Devotional music , good -- Mozart , good.
I hope that that after this talk you ' ll be doing that.
Musicians have bigger brains -- it ' s true.
Protect your ears ?  Yes , absolutely.
My vision is of a world that sounds beautiful and if we all start doing these things , we will take a very big step in that direction.
http://www.ted.com/talks/janna_levin_the_sound_the_universe_makes.html
Janna Levin : The sound the universe makes
We see light reflected off the Moon.
I ' d like to convince you that the universe has a soundtrack and that soundtrack is played on space itself , because space can wobble like a drum.
So in this ambition to capture songs from the universe , we turn our focus to black holes and the promise they have , because black holes can bang on space-time like mallets on a drum and have a very characteristic song , which I ' d like to play for you -- some of our predictions for what that song will be like.
We can see them indirectly , because black holes wreak havoc on their environment.
We might one day see a shadow a black hole can cast on a very bright background , but we haven ' t yet.
But if we were freely falling through the space , even without this helpful grid , we might be able to paint it ourselves , because we would notice that we traveled along straight lines , undeflected straight paths through the universe.
And you can be bent so much that you ' re caught in orbit around the Sun , as the Earth is , or the Moon around the Earth.
I like to imagine Schwarzschild in the war in the trenches calculating ballistic trajectories for cannon fire , and then , in between , calculating Einstein ' s equations -- as you do in the trenches.
Light would be dragged down the hole as everything else would be , and all that would be left would be a shadow.
This is the hardworking scientist under harsh conditions.
He thought nature would protect us from their formation.
But if we did a little thought experiment -- as Einstein was very fond of doing -- we could imagine putting the Sun crushed down to six kilometers , and putting a tiny little Earth around it in orbit , maybe 30 kilometers outside of the black-hole sun.
It might spill off into the Hudson a little bit before it destroyed the Earth.
There ' s a sort of myth that black holes devour everything in the universe , but you actually have to get very close to fall in.
So you can ' t hide anything behind a black hole.
And if one were to eclipse the Milky Way , this is what it would look like.
But even though the black hole is dark from the outside , it ' s not dark on the inside , because all of the light from the galaxy can fall in behind us.
Now we ' ve never seen a shadow like this of a black hole , but black holes can be heard , even if they ' re not seen.
They can be spinning hundreds of times a second.
And they travel out into the cosmos at the speed of light.
It shows two black holes in orbit around each other , again , with these helpfully painted curves.
You would literally hear the sound.
Imagine a lighter black hole falling into a very heavy black hole.
And we can predict what the sound will be.
Now I ' ve never heard it that loud -- it ' s actually more dramatic.
No , I ' m not showing you any images , because black holes don ' t leave behind helpful trails of ink , and space is not painted , showing you the curves.
Both black holes are getting closer together.
Now that chirp is very characteristic of black holes merging -- that it chirps up at the end.
And surely , the space around us is ringing after traveling maybe a million light years , or a million years , at the speed of light to get to us.
There ' s also a mission proposed for space , which hopefully will launch in the next ten years , called LISA.
And each one probably harbors a super-massive black hole at its core.
But LISA could see the final stages of two super-massive black holes earlier in the universe ' s history , the last 15 minutes before they fall together.
It might make a sound.
It ' s everywhere , it ' s all around you , and the space is wobbling chaotically.
Imagine a billion years ago , two black holes collided.
It ' s like hurry , build your instruments.
It ' s a terrible sound.
And if we pick it up , it will be music to our ears because it will be the quiet echo of that moment of our creation , of our observable universe.
I mean we have to ask , has it happened before ? 
Or , is it possible that we ' re just a branch off of a multiverse -- each branch with its own Big Bang in its past -- maybe some of them with black holes playing drums , maybe some without -- maybe some with sentient life , and maybe some without -- not in our past , not in our future , but somehow fundamentally connected to us ? 
And if they are , I can imagine them as we are , calculating , writing computer code , building instruments , trying to detect that faintest sound of their origins and wondering who else is out there.

Trees are rooted in the ground in one place for many human generations , but if we shift our perspective from the trunk to the twigs , trees become very dynamic entities , moving and growing.
The piece of art you see on your left is painted by a western red cedar and that on your right by a Douglas fir , and what I learned was that different species have different signatures , like a Picasso versus a Monet.
You might have a guess.
Prisons , of course , are where people who break our laws are stuck , confined behind bars.
Of the 100 incarcerated people that are released , 60 will return to prison.
Working with four prisons , we began bringing science and scientists , sustainability and conservation projects to four state prisons.
That , I think , is movement.
They ' re kept in bare cells like this for 23 hours a day.
This is Mr . Lopez , who has been in solitary confinement for 18 months , and he ' s providing input on the types of images that he believes would make him and his fellow inmates more serene , more calm , less apt to violence.
http://www.ted.com/talks/swami_dayananda_saraswati.html
Swami Dayananda Saraswati : The profound journey of compassion
It doesn ' t know how to survive , even though it is endowed with an instinct to survive.
It has to totally surrender.
It doesn ' t know even the word  " violation. " 
To be compassionate is not a joke.
The self : you are self-aware.
Thank God we are empathetic.
It can be anybody ' s game.
The winner boxes the air and kisses the ground , throws his shirt as though somebody is waiting for it.
Why ?  Empathy.
No culture , no nation and nationalism -- nothing can touch it because it is empathy.
There ' s no American compassion.
Then this occasional compassion , we are not talking about -- it will never remain occasional.
It ' s not an action , but in the English language , it is also an action.
In spite of a very tragic life , one is happy in moments which are very few and far between.
The subject --  " me "  -- and the object -- the scheme of things -- fuse into oneness , an experience nobody can say ,  " I am denied of, "  an experience common to all and sundry.
There ' s no choice in this : that only confirms the reality that the wholeness cannot be different from you , cannot be minus you.
Maybe the swami is right.
If one has to blame oneself , one has a million reasons plus many.
Everything is going to be limitless.
And the wholeness is the reality of you when you relate to the world.
Then that again transforms into giving , into sharing.
There is no shortcut : it is like swimming by swimming.
You learn cooking by cooking , having some sympathetic people around you to eat what you cook.
You have to act it out.
You act compassionately.
You fake it and make it.
Let me act compassionately.
http://www.ted.com/talks/shirin_neshat_art_in_exile.html
Shirin Neshat : Art in exile
Every Iranian artist , in one form or another , is political.
Therefore , we don ' t find the moral , emotional , psychological and political space to distance ourselves from the reality of social responsibility.
We are there to take pride and insist on respect.
We are in a position of danger.
We are the reporters of our people , and are communicators to the outside world.
For the fact that they can distance themselves from the question of politics.
My journey as an artist started from a very , very personal place.
While I was absent from Iran , the Islamic Revolution had descended on Iran and had entirely transformed the country from Persian to the Islamic culture.
I found the subject of Iranian women immensely interesting , in the way the women of Iran , historically , seemed to embody the political transformation.
And yet , I had an unusual position toward this.
My knife became a little sharper.
I go everywhere to make believe it ' s Iran.
It goes to 1953 when American CIA exercised a coup and removed a democratically elected leader , Dr . Mossadegh.
My obsession with this book , and the reason I made this into a film , is because it at once was addressing the question of being a female -- traditionally , historically in Iran -- and the question of four women who are all looking for an idea of change , freedom and democracy -- while the country of Iran , equally , as if another character , also struggled for an idea of freedom and democracy and independence from the foreign interventions.
This film also speaks to the Iranian people in asking them to return to their history and look at themselves before they were so Islamicized -- in the way we looked , in the way we played music , in the way we had intellectual life.
And we made this film in Casablanca , recreating all the shots.
How to tell a political story but an allegorical story.
What is unbelievably ironic is the period that we tried to depict in the film , the cry for democracy and social justice , repeats itself now again in Tehran.
They ' re absolutely inspirational for me.
That , under all circumstances , they have pushed the boundary.
I stand here to say that Iranian women have found a new voice , and their voice is giving me my voice.
biology,brain,medicine,mind,neurology,psychology
And seeing with the brain is often called imagination.
They don ' t seem to be under our control.
They told me that one of their residents , an old lady in her 90s , was seeing things , and they wondered if she ' d gone bonkers or , because she was an old lady , whether she ' d had a stroke , or whether she had Alzheimer ' s.
And she told me -- the nurses hadn ' t mentioned this -- that she was blind , that she had been completely blind from macular degeneration for five years.
A man who turns towards me and smiles.
I see this horse with a harness , dragging the snow away.
Then it changes again.
I said ,  " Is this like a dream ?  " 
And she said that it ' s a rather boring movie.
But she was frightened . She ' d lived 95 years and she ' d never had a hallucination before.
And none of the people or the animals , well , they all seemed oblivious of her.
She was a bright old lady , perfectly sane . She had no medical problems.
I said ,  " There is a special form of visual hallucination which may go with deteriorating vision or blindness.
You have Charles Bonnet syndrome. " 
And she said ,  " Tell all the nurses that I have Charles Bonnet syndrome. " 
I work in old-age homes , largely.
You don ' t have to be completely blind , only sufficiently impaired.
He ' d had cataract surgery.
It was a large blue handkerchief with four orange circles.
But sometimes he wasn ' t sure whether he was hallucinating or not , because the hallucinations would fit in the context of the visions.
It ' s typical of these hallucinations that they may come in a flash and disappear in a flash.
On one occasion , he saw a man in a bathrobe smoking a pipe , and realized it was himself.
This repetition of perception is sometimes called palinopsia.
With another patient of mine , who , also had some vision , the vision she had could be disturbing.
Once , when she was driving , or rather , her husband was driving , the road divided into four and she felt herself going simultaneously up four roads.
He was very tenacious and he moved rather gracefully when the car turned.
And , above all , she would see cartoons.
You know , I was wondering about Freudian determinants.
But what did disturb her was she got very persistent images or hallucinations of faces and as with Rosalie , the faces were often deformed , with very large teeth or very large eyes.
Something like 10 percent , as I said , of visually impaired people get these.
Psychotic hallucinations , whether they are visual or vocal , they address you . They accuse you.
There is none of this quality of being addressed with these Charles Bonnet hallucinations.
You smell chestnuts roasting.
And the temporal lobe hallucinations are all-sense hallucinations , full of feeling , full of familiarity , located in space and time , coherent , dramatic.
And one of the second commonest is cartoons.
When people have these simple geometrical hallucinations , the primary visual cortex is activated.
And in particular , one area of the temporal lobe is called the fusiform gyrus.
There is another part of the brain which is especially activated when one sees cartoons.
Around 1970 , it was found that there were not only parts of the brain , but particular cells.
I saw an Aston Martin this morning.
It ' s only at higher levels that the other senses join in and there are connections with memory and emotion.
It is only if one is visually impaired or blind that the process is interrupted.
The mind does its best to organize and to give some sort of coherence to this , but not terribly successfully.
You don ' t get anywhere thinking of them as dreams.
There must be hundreds of thousands of blind people who have these hallucinations , but are too scared to mention them.
Now , 250 years later , I think we ' re beginning to glimpse how this is done.
Oliver Sacks : I was afraid you ' d ask that.
And I see the geometrical hallucinations.
OS : Well they don ' t disturb me any more than my tinnitus , which I ignore.
CA : That was an utterly , utterly fascinating talk.
Salman Khan talks about how and why he created the remarkable Khan Academy , a carefully structured series of educational videos offering complete curricula in math and , now , other subjects . He shows the power of interactive exercises , and calls for teachers to consider flipping the traditional classroom script -- give students video lectures to watch at home , and do  " homework "  in the classroom with the teacher available to help.
Salman Khan : So the hypotenuse is now going to be five.
Notice , this is an aldehyde , and it ' s an alcohol.
And for dollars , is their 30 million , plus the 20 million dollars from the American manufacturer.
But what we ' re going to talk about in this is how we ' re going to the next level.
And as soon as I put those first YouTube videos up , something interesting happened -- actually a bunch of interesting things happened.
They were saying that they preferred the automated version of their cousin to their cousin.
They can just watch those videos . If they ' re bored , they can go ahead.
The other thing that happened is -- I put them on YouTube just -- I saw no reason to make it private , so I let other people watch it , and then people started stumbling on it , and I started getting some comments and some letters and all sorts of feedback from random people from around the world.
And let ' s pause here.
I actually got a natural high and a good mood for the entire day.
This is just an excerpt from one of those letters.
Then we went on to the dreaded fractions . Again , he got it.
It was very strange for me to do something of social value.
If Isaac Newton had done YouTube videos on calculus , I wouldn ' t have to.
It ' s good for maybe home schoolers. " 
You ' ve given the lectures , so now what we do .. .  "  -- and this could happen in every classroom in America tomorrow --  "  .. . what I do is I assign the lectures for homework , and what used to be homework , I now have the students doing in the classroom. " 
But the more interesting thing is -- and this is the unintuitive thing when you talk about technology in the classroom -- by removing the one-size-fits-all lecture from the classroom and letting students have a self-paced lecture at home , and then when you go to the classroom , letting them do work , having the teacher walk around , having the peers actually be able to interact with each other , these teachers have used technology to humanize the classroom.
So once the Khan Academy -- I quit my job and we turned into a real organization -- we ' re a not-for-profit -- the question is , how do we take this to the next level ? 
This is a more competent version of it.
But the paradigm here , it seems like a very simple thing : 10 in a row , you move on.
And even that 95 percent student , what was the five percent they didn ' t know ? 
And then I come back after two weeks , and I say ,  " Well , let ' s see . You ' re having trouble taking left turns.
But as ridiculous as that sounds , that ' s exactly what ' s happening in our classrooms right now.
Do it as long as necessary until you have mastery.
This is just another one of the modules.
We have about 90 of these right now.
It ' s like one plus one is equal to two.
Further down , you start getting into algebra one , algebra two , a little bit of precalculus.
It ' ll change what happens at the dinner table.
They ' re doing Khan Academy , they ' re doing that software , for roughly half of their math class.
And so the paradigm is the teacher walks in every day , every kid works at their own pace -- and this is actually a live dashboard from Los Altos school district -- and they look at this dashboard.
Blue means they ' re working on it -- no need to worry.
Now I come from a very data-centric reality , so we don ' t want that teacher to even go and intervene and have to ask the kid awkward questions :  " Oh , what do you not understand ?  "  or  " What do you do understand ?  " 
The outer circle shows what exercises they were focused on.
The leftmost question is the first question that the student attempted.
They also got faster.
And in a traditional model , if you did a snapshot assessment , you say ,  " These are the gifted kids , these are the slow kids.
And so the same kids that you thought were slow six weeks ago , you now would think are gifted.
And actually , that kind of brings an interesting point.
Maybe five percent of their time is actually sitting next to students and actually working with them.
Imagine what it does to a street kid in Calcutta who has to help his family during the day , and that ' s the reason why he or she can ' t go to school.
There ' s no reason why you can ' t have that peer-to-peer tutoring beyond that one classroom.
Bill Gates : I ' ve seen some things you ' re doing in the system that have to do with motivation and feedback -- energy points , merit badges.
I ' m still doing all the videos , but we have a rockstar team doing the software.
BG : And the collaboration you ' re doing with Los Altos , how did that come about ? 
And I said ,  " Well , I would just , every student work at their own pace on something like this and we ' d give a dashboard. " 
BG : So fifth grade math is where that ' s going on right now ? 
It ' s not an only-in-school thing.
Through the summers , as they go from one teacher to the next , you have this continuity of data that even at the district level they can see.
We made some of those for students so they could see their data , but we have a very tight design loop with the teachers themselves.
It ' s been pretty crazy.
We ' ve got a million people on the site already , so we can handle a few more.
SK : Absolutely . And this is something that I recommend everyone in this audience to do.
BG : Well , it ' s amazing.
In the deep , dark ocean , many sea creatures make their own light for hunting , mating and self-defense . Bioluminescence expert Edith Widder was one of the first to film this glimmering world . At TED2011 , she brings some of her glowing friends onstage , and shows more astonishing footage of glowing undersea life.
So I want to take you on a trip to an alien world.
I study it because I think understanding it is critical to understanding life in the ocean where most bioluminescence occurs.
But I would come back from those dives and try to share the experience with words , and they were totally inadequate to the task.
And the first thing you ' re going to see is a transect screen that is about a meter across.
Edith Widder : So I recorded that with an intensified video camera that has about the sensitivity of the fully dark-adapted human eye.
And you ' ll note there ' s no light coming from them right now , either because they ' re dead -- or because I need to stir them up in some way for you to see what bioluminescence really looks like.
So why would a single-celled alga need to be able to produce light ? 
There ' s a lot of animals that use this trick , for example this black dragonfish.
So we had to chase this in the submersible for quite sometime , because the top speed of this fish is one knot , which was the top speed of the submersible.
That chin barbel is flashing.
And you normally don ' t get to see this because we ' ve exhausted the luminescence when we bring them up in nets.
This little squid is called the fire shooter because of its ability to do this.
And we have a pretty good idea , for most of them , why.
They ' re things like this.
The other reason is this amazing bush glows.
And these are flytrap anemones.
It produces these strings of light , presumably as some form of defense.
And it anchors itself in the sand by blowing up a balloon on the end of its stock.
But we have no idea why it does that.
And like the one you just saw , it can produce these as bands of light.
I ' d be very interested in your theories about what that ' s about.
It ' s just 16 blue LEDs that we can program to do different types of displays.
It ' s not high-resolution.
But as soon as it starts to flash -- and it ' s going to look big , because it blooms on the camera -- I want you to look right here.
And this was very consistent.
But the cool thing is , we ' re talking to it.
We ' ve only just begun to analyze all of this data.
And I can ' t claim for sure that the optical source brought it in , because there ' s bait right there.
Okay , so this next one is from the webcam , and it ' s going to be this pinwheel display.
But if it ' s a burglar alarm , you wouldn ' t expect it to attack the jellyfish directly.
 " Hey , wait a minute.
He keeps coming back.
We need more eyes on the process.
It ' s a magical place filled with breathtaking light shows and bizarre and wondrous creatures , alien life forms that you don ' t have to travel to another planet to see.
“The world needs you , badly,” begins celebrated biologist E.O . Wilson in his letter to a young scientist . Previewing his upcoming book , he gives advice collected from a lifetime of experience -- reminding us that wonder and creativity are the center of the scientific life . <em></em>
What I ' m going to do is to just give a few notes , and this is from a book I ' m preparing called  " Letters to a Young Scientist. " 
The world needs you , badly.
Knowledge in medical science and science overall is doubling every 15 to 20 years.
There will come a time , of course , when the exponential growth of discovery and knowledge , which actually began in the 1600s , has to peak and level off , but that ' s not going to matter to you.
In time , all of science will come to be a continuum of description , an explanation of networks , of principles and laws.
It was put there by our distant ancestors who spread across the world , and it ' s never going to be quenched.
It will be better for all if they prepare before entering office rather than learning on the job.
Many of the most successful scientists at work today are mathematically semi-literate.
These math-phobes deprive science and medicine of immeasurable amounts of badly needed talent.
I speak as an authority on that subject , because I ' m an extreme case.
A couple of them were students in a course I was giving on evolutionary biology.
I found out that advances in science rarely come upstream from an ability to stand at a blackboard and conjure images from unfolding mathematical propositions and equations.
When something new is discovered , it ' s logical then that one of the follow-up steps is to find the mathematical and statistical methods to move its analysis forward.
Keep in mind , then , Wilson ' s Second Principle : For every scientist , whether researcher , technician , teacher , manager or businessman , working at any level of mathematical competence , there exists a discipline in science or medicine for which that level is enough to achieve excellence.
This is not to de-emphasize the essential requirement of broad training , or the value of apprenticing yourself in ongoing research to programs of high quality.
There is the quickest way advances are likely to occur , as measured in discoveries per investigator per year.
Observe from a distance , but do not join the fray.
And on then into the social sciences , where it is possible in short time to acquire the status of an authority.
Well , if that ' s the case , good . Why hard instead of easy ? 
Scientists , pure mathematicians among them , follow one or the other of two pathways : First through early discoveries , a problem is identified and a solution is sought.
This first of the two strategies is like a hunter , exploring a forest in search of a particular quarry , who finds other quarries along the way.
And conversely , for every species or other entity or phenomenon , there exist important problems for the solution of which , those particular objects of research are ideally suited.
All of humanity depends on the knowledge and practice of the medicine and the science behind it you will master.
Thank you very much.

Now molecules are really , really tiny.
So what we can do is actually tell you about the molecules , but we don ' t really have a direct way of showing you the molecules.
They draw pictures of what they ' re observing with their eyes , through technology like telescopes and microscopes , and also what they ' re thinking about in their minds.
The perception in the 17th century was the Moon was a perfect heavenly sphere.
Even as a scientist , I used to go to lectures by molecular biologists and find them completely incomprehensible , with all the fancy technical language and jargon that they would use in describing their work , until I encountered the artworks of David Goodsell , who is a molecular biologist at the Scripps Institute.
In the top left-hand corner , you ' ve got this yellow-green area.
They are actually red ; that ' s what gives blood its color.
And that ' s how I really began . So let ' s begin.
Those are the letters of genetic code , the 25,000 genes you ' ve got written in your DNA.
But they physically run in opposite directions , which creates a number of complications for your living cells , as you ' re about to see , most particularly when DNA is being copied.
One strand can be copied directly , and you can see these things spooling off to the bottom there.
It ' s an accurate representation , and it ' s pretty much at the correct speed for what is occurring inside you.
So again , we begin with DNA.
So to keep the DNA organized and regulate access to the genetic code , it ' s wrapped around these purple proteins -- or I ' ve labeled them purple here.
And we ' ll come back to chromosomes in a minute.
No , I ' m being told ,  " No. " 
These sausage-shaped things are the chromosomes , and we ' ll focus on them.
And then the cell splits down the middle.
The chromosomes line up.
And you have two strands of DNA in each chromosome.
They ' re called mircrotubules . That name ' s not important.
We ' ve been studying this thing they call the kinetochore for over a hundred years with intense study , and we ' re still just beginning to discover what it ' s all about.
It is able to couple onto the growing and shrinking microtubules.
It ' s turning green here because it feels that everything is just right.
And it ' s walked away . I mean , it ' s that mechanical.
They ' re little molecular courier molecules walking one way.
The problem is we can ' t show it to you any other way.
http://www.ted.com/talks/howard_rheingold_on_collaboration.html
Howard Rheingold : The new power of collaboration
It ' s a narrative spread across a number of different disciplines , in which cooperation , collective action and complex interdependencies play a more important role.
Humans have lived for much , much longer than the approximately 10,000 years of settled agricultural civilization in small family groups . Nomadic hunters bring down rabbits , gathering food.
And again , we have no way of knowing , but it ' s clear that a new form of wealth must have emerged.
And if so , how did they make arrangements ? 
Not too much longer after that , the alphabet was invented.
We saw scientific revolutions , the Protestant Reformation , constitutional democracies possible where they had not been possible before.
But capitalism , as we know it , is only a few hundred years old , enabled by cooperative arrangements and technologies , such as the joint-stock ownership company , shared liability insurance , double-entry bookkeeping.
Now , when I started looking into collective action , the considerable literature on it is based on what sociologists call  " social dilemmas. " 
If you have more questions about it , ask Kevin Kelly later.
Neither one wants to be the first one or they ' re going to get the sucker ' s payoff , but both lose , of course , because they don ' t get what they want.
Another economic game that may not be as well known as the prisoner ' s dilemma is the ultimatum game , and it ' s also a very interesting probe of our assumptions about the way people make economic transactions.
Yet in thousands of trials with American and European and Japanese students , a significant percentage would reject any offer that ' s not close to 50/50.
The other major narrative of social dilemmas is the tragedy of the commons.
Now , Elinor Ostrom , a political scientist , in 1990 asked the interesting question that any good scientist should ask , which is : is it really true that humans will always despoil commons ? 
And she said that people are only prisoners if they consider themselves to be.
But there is really no longer any major debate over the fact that cooperative arrangements have moved from a peripheral role to a central role in biology , from the level of the cell to the level of the ecology.
And most recently , neurophysiological measures have shown that people who punish cheaters in economic games show activity in the reward centers of their brain.
And yet we see very little talk about how the next form may be emerging.
Eli Lilly -- in , again , the fiercely competitive pharmaceutical world -- has created a market for solutions for pharmaceutical problems.
Google enriches itself by enriching thousands of bloggers through AdSense.
Instead of ,  " Neither of us can trust each other , so we have to make suboptimal moves, "  it ' s ,  " You prove to me that you are trustworthy and I will cooperate. " 
Millions of people have contributed their desktop computers when they ' re not using them to link together through the Internet into supercomputing collectives that help solve the protein folding problem for medical researchers -- that ' s Folding@home at Stanford -- to crack codes , to search for life in outer space.
This is all about self-interest that adds up to more.
A transdisciplinary study of cooperation ? 
Descartes said we need an entire new way of thinking.
So I enlist you to help me get the cooperation project started.

And we really are seeing this in very different terms from the kind of mapping and direction site that one is used to.
This can be viewed from any of the cardinal directions to show you the 3D structure of the city , all the facades.
This wonderful one which I don ' t have time to show you is taking hyper-local blogs in real time and mapping those stories , those entries to the places that are referred to on the blogs.
These little green bubbles represent photosynths that users have made.
Now , I ' ll show you a fun app that -- we ' ve been working on a collaboration with our friends at Flickr.
So you really see how this kind of crowd-sourced imagery is integrating , in a very deep way , into the map itself.
Now I just made a transition indoors . That ' s also interesting.
And from here , we ' re able to do the same sorts of registration , not only of still images , but also of video.
All right . I ' m hitting it . I ' m punching play.
OK , George , can you pan back over to the corner market ? 
I don ' t want to see you guys yet.
What the hell are you guys -- oh , sorry.
All right , let me just take a moment and thank the team.
When you use it on the spot , it means that you ' re able to bring all of that metadata and information about the world to you.

Sophal Ear : Escaping the Khmer Rouge
And we ' re actually Cambodians.
Video : April 17th , 1975.
But after four years the grim truth seeps out.
And here is a picture of the Khmer Rouge.
I mean , from 1965 to 1973 there were more munitions that fell on Cambodia than in all of World War II Japan , including the two nuclear bombs of August 1945.
I think it ' s the only precedent in which money has ever been stopped from being used.
It ' s actually a very pretty area of Cambodia , where rice growing takes place.
And she spoke some Vietnamese , as a child having grown up with Vietnamese friends.
And he didn ' t speak Vietnamese.
And there they had a detention camp where alleged Vietnamese would be tested , language tested.
If she fails , we ' re all headed to the gallows ; if she passes , we can leave to Vietnam.
And this is a picture of Hong Ngu , Vietnam today.
Last year , the Khmer Rouge Tribunal , which the U.N . is helping Cambodia take on , started , and I decided that as a matter of record I should file a Civil Complaint with the Tribunal about my father ' s passing away.
And she was able to return to a place that for her meant freedom , but also fear , because we had just come out of Cambodia.
http://www.ted.com/talks/inge_missmahl_brings_peace_to_the_minds_of_afghanistan.html
Inge Missmahl brings peace to the minds of Afghanistan
Afghanistan is one of the poorest countries in the world , and 70 percent of the people are illiterate.
Local and foreign military are supposed to build peace together with the donors and the governmental and non-governmental organizations.
One day a man told me ,  " My future does not look brilliant , but I want to have a brilliant future for my son. " 
Military collect weapons , and depression stays intact.
However , what can wound us and our reaction to those wounds -- they are universal.
No one can survive alone.
To compensate this loss of inner control , they try to control the outside , very understandably -- mostly the family -- and unfortunately , this fits very well into the traditional side , regressive side , repressive side , restrictive side of the cultural context.
And partly this is already happening.
So the key here is empathy.
Everybody must be able to know what he or she has experienced is true , and this only goes with another person.
And I started thinking about a counseling program.
This man gave me his contact details at the end of the evening and said ,  " If you want to do this , call me. " 
Eleven thousand people came -- more than that.
We developed a culturally-sensitive psycho-social counseling approach.
This means , certainly , to retrain all health staff.
And here you can see the patients all had symptoms of depression , moderate and severe.
And you can see the symptoms almost completely go away , and the psycho-social stress has dropped significantly , which is explicable , because you cannot take away the psycho-social stresses , but you can learn how to cope with them.
They go to the clinics , because they want to cure their immediate symptoms , and they will find somebody to talk to and discuss these issues and talk about what is burdening them and find solutions , develop their resources , learn tools to solve their family conflicts and gain some confidence in the future.
And another counselor said to me after the training ,  " You know , I never knew why I survived the killings in my village , but now I know , because I am part of a nucleus of a new peaceful society in Afghanistan. " 
I thought it was an idea worth spreading , and I think it must be , can be , could be replicated elsewhere.
TED Prize,TED2009,arts,culture,education,entertainment,global issues,music,philanthropy,poverty
Jose Antonio Abreu : My dear friends , ladies and gentlemen , I am overjoyed today at being awarded the TED Prize on behalf of all the distinguished music teachers , artists and educators from Venezuela who have selflessly and loyally accompanied me for 35 years in founding , growing and developing in Venezuela the National System of Youth and Children ' s Orchestras and Choirs.
From that desire and from my heart stemmed the idea to make music a deep and global reality for my country.
When I arrived at the rehearsal , only 11 kids had shown up , and I said to myself ,  " Do I close the program or multiply these kids ?  " 
Today we can say that art in Latin America is no longer a monopoly of elites and that it has become a social right , a right for all the people.
This meant not only an artistic triumph , but also a profound emotional sympathy between the public of the most advanced nations of the world and the musical youth of Latin America , as seen in Venezuela , giving these audiences a message of music , vitality , energy , enthusiasm and strength.
This is why music is immensely important in the awakening of sensibility , in the forging of values and in the training of youngsters to teach other kids.
JA : Each teenager and child in El Sistema has his own story , and they are all important and of great significance to me.
We have another well-known case -- Gustavo Dudamel.
He is the musical director of Los Angeles Philharmonic , and is still the overall leader of Venezuela ' s junior orchestras.
The effect of El Sistema is felt in three fundamental circles : in the personal/social circle , in the family circle and in the community.
All this leads to the development of self-esteem and confidence.
Within the family , the parents '  support is unconditional.
All this makes up a constructive and ascending social dynamic.
The spontaneity music has excludes it as a luxury item and makes it a patrimony of society.
The huge spiritual world that music produces in itself , which also lies within itself , ends up overcoming material poverty.
A few years ago , historian Arnold Toynbee said that the world was suffering a huge spiritual crisis.
With passion and enthusiasm we pay profound respects to TED for its outstanding humanism , the scope of its principles , for its open and generous promotion of young values.
We are going live to Caracas to hear Maestro Abreu ' s TED Prize wish.
demo,design,education,entertainment,future,interface design,media,technology
And these will be some simple design qualities and they will also be some qualities of , if you will , the intelligence of interaction.
People have this belief -- and I share most of it -- that we will be using the TV screens or their equivalents for electronic books of the future . But then you think ,  " My God! What a terrible image you get when you look at still pictures on TV. " 
Where you are now , all of a sudden , sitting in front of personal computers and video text -- teletext systems , and somewhat horrified by what you see on the screen ? 
And they can be treated very easily ; there are actually ways of getting rid of them , there are actually ways of just making absolutely beautiful pictures.
I ' m very interested in touch-sensitive displays.
And so when you see on the market these systems that have just a few light emitting diodes on the side and are very low resolution , it ' s nice that they exist because it still is better than nothing.
When you think for a second of the mouse on Macintosh -- and I will not criticize the mouse too much -- when you ' re typing -- what you have -- you want to now put something -- first of all , you ' ve got to find the mouse.
Again , what I ' m trying to do is just illustrate the kinds of problems that I think face the designers of new computer systems and entertainment systems and educational systems from the perspective of the quality of that interface.
What we did stumble across was something ...
But the bug in our case was in touch-sensitive displays : we wanted to be able to draw -- you know , rub your finger across the screen to input continuous points -- and there was just too much friction created between your finger and the glass -- if glass was the substrate , which it usually is.
Now , imagine a screen , which is not only touch-sensitive now , it ' s pressure-sensitive.
The person ' s just , if you will , pushing on the screen to make a curve.
So all we have is this record.
And what you can do -- oops , I didn ' t mean to do that -- what you can do is actually feed back to the user the feeling of the physical properties.
So it ' s not simply looking at the quality or , if you will , the luxury of that interface , but it ' s actually looking at the idea of presenting things that previously couldn ' t be presented before.
We are so used to doing monologues.
So , book writing is the same thing.
So it knows , or at least there is computer-readable information in the medium itself . It ' s just not a static movie frame.
Now , that would be , if you will , the top green track , which doesn ' t mean too much . But you might have to elaborate for me or for somebody who isn ' t an expert , and say ,  " Cook at 380 degrees for 45 minutes. " 
And the other is where you want to explain the same thing in different ways.
So , what I will show you is .. . it ' s a rather boring book , but I ' m afraid sometimes you have to do boring books because your sponsors aren ' t necessarily interested in fiction and entertainment . And this is a book on how to repair a transmission.
Narrator : When I find a chapter that I want to see , I just touch the text and the system will format pages for me to read.
Narrator : This is another example of a page with glossary words highlighted in red.
And the movie is displayed as a full frame movie.
Repairman : .. . Not too far out . Front poles , preferably.
And of course , good education has got to be good entertainment , so my first example will be drawn from a very recent experiment that we ' ve been doing -- in this case , in Senegal -- where we have tried to use personal computers as a pedagogical medium . But not as teaching machines at all ; the whole notion is to use this as an instrument where there is a complete reversal of roles -- the child is , if you will , the teacher and the machine is the student -- and the art of computer programming is a vehicle that sort of approximates thinking about thinking.
But did hang around the , quote ,  " computer room, "  where there were quite a few computers , and learned this particular language called Logo -- and learned it with great ease and found it a lot of fun , it was very interesting . And one day , by chance , some visitors from the NIE came by in their double-breasted suits looking at this setup , and none of the children who were normally there , except for this one child , were there.
That child was very articulate and showed us and even dealt with the things he couldn ' t do automatically with that manual . It was just absolutely fantastic. " 
And the child said ,  " No , I can ' t. " 
It ' s absolutely irrelevant , and I get nothing for it.
And that story has many other anecdotes that are similar , but wow . The key to the future of computers in education is right there , and it is : when does it mean something to a child ? 
Hence , it must be harder. "  Well , it ' s not harder.
So what happens is you go to school and people say ,  " Just believe me , you ' re going to like it.
And in fact , it ' s a powerful educational instrument.
But rooted in that , little did she know how much knowledge she was acquiring about geometry and just math and logic and all the rest.
Yes , it is . It ' s our work -- that was a while ago , and it still is my favorite project -- of teleconferencing.
So if I wanted to call my friend Peter Sprague on the phone , my secretary would get his head out and bring it and set it on the desk , and that would be the TV used for the occasion.
And when somebody gets up , in fact , to go answer a phone or use a bathroom or something , the empty seat becomes , if you will , that person . And you point frequently to the empty seat and you say ,  " He or she wouldn ' t agree, "  and the empty chair is that person and the spatiality is crucial.
And I ' ll show you one more slide , where this is actually made from something called a solid photograph and is the screen.
And it really is reconstructing , quite accurately , teleconferencing.

We ' re testing these kinds of simple sensor-network technologies in the home so that any phone that a senior is already comfortable with can help them deal with their medications.
Now , we also do some pretty amazing things with these phones.
All right ?  That ' s the first time.
All right ?  Very big differences between the way I answered the phone the three times.
There ' s lots of others . Is the person going to the phone as quickly , when it rings , as they used to ? 
So , sensors are looking at that kind of voice.
Are you using the phone ?  Are you socializing less than you used to ? 
So , these are what I would call behavioral markers.
How do we change behavior ? 
We have now lived with 1,000 elderly households in 20 countries over the last 10 years.
If they have a family member who is a key part of their care network , we fly and study them as well.
Ten years ago , when I started trying to convince Intel to let me go start looking at disruptive technologies that could help with independent living , this is what I called it :  " Y2K + 10. " 
For the first time in human history -- and barring aliens landing or some major other pandemic , that ' s the expectation from demographers , going forward.
This is a map of the entire world.
And in fact , it ' s upon us.
A retired school teacher , there she is with a Social Security administrator.
This is 50 tsunamis scheduled on the calendar , but somehow we can ' t sort of marshal our government and innovative forces to sort of get out in front of it and do something about it . We ' ll wait until it ' s more of a catastrophe , and react , as opposed to prepare for it.
I was like ,  " Actually it was your idea . You said it in a Fortune Magazine article.
This is the first general hospital in Vienna.
Now , I ' m not anti-hospital.
And just as 30 years ago we couldn ' t conceive that we would have the power of a mainframe computer that took up a room this size in our purses and on our belts , that we ' re carrying around in our cell phone today , and suddenly , computing , that used to be an expert driven system , it was a personal system that we all owned as part of our daily lives -- that shift from mainframe to personal computing is what we have to do for healthcare.
The first word that comes up is  " doctor. " 
We ' re not thinking about how do we shift from the mainframe to the home.
It ' s population-based.
And now we want to do a double-double of the age wave coming through ? 
How do we collect vital signs and other kinds of information 24 by 7 ? 
That ' s what we need to do for our personal health model.
This is what was happening to Mimi ; the family was worried about it , moved her out of her own home into an assisted living facility.
They ' re going to be pressing that button non-stop . Right ? 
Now , the most frightening thing about this is this is my wife ' s grandmother.
What happens if you don ' t have money , you don ' t speak English or don ' t have the kind of access to deal with these kinds of problems that inevitably occur ? 
It ' s a research platform.
That ' s sort of the state of the art.
These discoveries of behavioral markers , and behavioral changes are game changing , and like the discovery of the microscope because of our collecting data streams that we ' ve actually never done before.
This is actually sensor firings.
This person on the left is living in their own home.
But when we look at these cycles of data over a longer period of time -- and we ' re looking at everything from motion around different rooms in the house , to sort of micro-motions that Shimmer picks up , about gait and stride length -- these streams of data are starting to tell us things about behavioral patterns that we ' ve never understood before.
So , my mantra here , my fourth slogan is : 10,000 households or bust.
My fifth and final phrase : I have tried for two years , and there were moments when we were quite close , to make this healthcare reform bill be about reform from something and to something , from a mainframe model to a personal health model , or to mean something more than just a debate about the public option and how we ' re going to finance.
The president needs to stand up and say , at the end of a healthcare reform debate ,  " Our goal as a country is to move 50 percent of care out of institutions , clinics , hospitals and nursing homes , to the home , in 10 years. " 
So , you know , that ' s my last message to you.
So , I hope you ' ll turn this conference into that kind of movement forward.
1565
And I started to feed them in the most traditional and environmentally friendly way.
This was great . My pigs turned that food waste into delicious pork . I sold that pork to my school friends '  parents , and I made a good pocket money addition to my teenage allowance.
One morning , when I was feeding my pigs , I noticed a particularly tasty-looking sun-dried tomato loaf that used to crop up from time to time.
We ' re talking about good , fresh food that is being wasted on a colossal scale.
That ' s based on diet intake surveys , it ' s based on levels of obesity , it ' s based on a range of factors that gives you an approximate guess as to how much food is actually going into people ' s mouths.
Any dot above that line , and you ' ll quickly notice that that includes most countries in the world , represents unnecessary surplus , and is likely to reflect levels of waste in each country.
Countries rapidly shoot towards that 150 mark , and then they level off , and they don ' t really go on rising as you might expect.
A country like America has four times the amount of food that it needs.
In many ways , this is a great success story of human civilization , of the agricultural surpluses that we set out to achieve 12,000 years ago.
I found quite a few packets of biscuits amongst all the fruit and vegetables and everything else that was in there.
The first biscuit we ' re going to lose before we even leave the farm.
Two more we ' re going to throw away directly into bins.
Where does it end up ?  We ' re used to seeing the stuff on our plates , but what about all the stuff that goes missing in between ? 
But this is what you can see more or less on every street corner in Britain , in Europe , in North America.
Who lives in a household where that crust -- that slice at the first and last end of each loaf -- who lives in a household where it does get eaten ? 
This is the answer , unfortunately : 13,000 slices of fresh bread coming out of this one single factory every single day , day-fresh bread.
This farmer , for example , has invested 16,000 pounds in growing spinach , not one leaf of which he harvested , because there was a little bit of grass growing in amongst it.
If we do that to fruit and vegetables , you bet we can do it to animals too.
It ' s called sheep ' s organs.
I thought ,  " My goodness , what taboo have I broken ? 
This guy has thrashed me at my own game. " 
This is an experiment I did on three lettuces.
The one on the right I treated like cut flowers.
In fact , humans answered that question 6,000 years ago : We domesticated pigs to turn food waste back into food.
It ' s also a massive saving of resources.
If we feed our food waste which is the current government favorite way of getting rid of food waste , to anaerobic digestion , which turns food waste into gas to produce electricity , you save a paltry 448 kilograms of carbon dioxide per ton of food waste . It ' s much better to feed it to pigs.
We fed 5,000 people all on food that otherwise would have been wasted.
Stop wasting food . Thank you very much.
1163
And so that ' s what I ' ve been striving for all of my life.
In fact , I don ' t read much of anything.
I basically practice for finding money on the street.
People were starting to get an idea that dinosaurs were special.
I have gone on to find more things and discover that dinosaurs really were very social.
The adults can recognize the juveniles ; the juveniles can recognize the adults.
And in his book , he talked about the social animals.
You all know the story , right.
And I guess you inject it into maybe an ostrich egg , or something like that , and then you wait , and , lo and behold , out pops a little baby dinosaur.
And then , then , then , and then ...
And probably a whole bunch of trees as well.
And one of my former doctoral students , Dr . Mary Schweitzer , actually had the background to do this sort of thing.
And so she thought , well , what the heck.
And that was really cool.
So a few years went by , and then we started the Hell Creek Project.
We found a lot of Tyrannosaurs , but we found one special Tyrannosaur , and we called it B-rex.
We don ' t really know how long dinosaurs lived , because we haven ' t found the oldest one yet.
So here was the character that linked birds and dinosaurs.
But there was something left.
It was extraordinary.
We thought maybe it was deteriorating very fast.
The vessels looked better.
So we have discovered that dinosaur DNA , and all DNA , just breaks down too fast.
Birds are living dinosaurs.
Avian dinosaurs are our modern birds.
 " You can call it a dinosaur , but look at the velociraptor : the velociraptor is cool. " 
I mean it really is.
So that ' s what I ' m here to tell you about : how we are going to fix a chicken.
We have selection.
Or any of the other funny-looking little dogs.
That ' s how people make GloFish.
And now they ' re making Glow-rabbits and Glow-all-sorts-of-things.
There ' s what we call atavism activation.
Snakes are occasionally born with legs.
Now that ' s a good characteristic.
That ' s getting closer.
He ' s also interested in the transformation of the arm , the hand , to the wing.
And so that ' s what we ' re looking into.
But the cool thing is that , if you look in the embryo , as the embryo is developing the hand actually looks pretty much like the archaeopteryx hand.
We want to stop that gene from turning on , fusing those hands together , so we can get a chicken that hatches out with a three-fingered hand , like the archaeopteryx.
But a gene turns on and resorbs the tail , gets rid of it.
It ' s a cooler-looking chicken.
Why make this thing ? 
And quite frankly , I think if Colonel Sanders was to be careful how he worded it , he could actually advertise an extra piece.
Internet,computers,technology
Actually , it ' s deceptively large.
There were only two other Dannys on the Internet then.
Now , it just so happened that I got to register the third domain name on the Internet.
And then I thought ,  " Nah , that wouldn ' t be very nice. " 
If they had some extra bandwidth , they would deliver a message for you.
In fact , it was so successful that there ' s no way that these days you could make a book like this.
And that means that it ' s vulnerable to certain kinds of mistakes that can happen , or certain kinds of deliberate attacks , but even the mistakes can be bad.
Now , you don ' t really think that our airplane system depends on the Internet , and in some sense it doesn ' t.
Now , there was an interesting thing that happened last April.
Imagine how vulnerable the system is to deliberate attacks.
Nobody has claimed credit for that.
Now that same kind of software could destroy an oil refinery or a pharmaceutical factory or a semiconductor plant.
So actually , in the early days , back when it was the ARPANET , there were actually times -- there was a particular time it failed completely because one single message processor actually got a bug in it.
Everything started breaking.
Now , in fact , they couldn ' t do it for a lot of reasons today.
Most of them aren ' t based on the Internet yet , but they ' re starting to use the Internet for service functions , for administrative functions , and so if you take something like the cell phone system , which is still relatively independent of the Internet for the most part , Internet pieces are beginning to sneak into it in terms of some of the control and administrative functions , and it ' s so tempting to use these same building blocks because they work so well , they ' re cheap , they ' re repeated , and so on.
So we ' ve built this system where we understand all the parts of it , but we ' re using it in a very , very different way than we expected to use it , and it ' s gotten a very , very different scale than it was designed for.
They have an informed opinion , but it ' s changing so quickly that even the experts don ' t know exactly what ' s going on.
And the problem with it is , I think we are setting ourselves up for a kind of disaster like the disaster we had in the financial system , where we take a system that ' s basically built on trust , was basically built for a smaller-scale system , and we ' ve kind of expanded it way beyond the limits of how it was meant to operate.
There ' s no clear backup system that we ' ve very carefully kept to be independent of the Internet , made out of completely different sets of building blocks.
It ' s basically a matter of deciding to do it.
It ' s not that hard a problem.

And when you use these things you don ' t have to go like that.
Is Bill Gates here ? 
As you can see , these are all maps.
This , of course , is a map of the moon.
What the Frigoris you doing ?  Names are important.
And this is all done , by the way , by the International Astronomical Union.
I ' ll go through a little of them . Bolotnitsa.
It ' s time for Bolotnitsa! " 
One dyslexic kid and he could be ruining his life.
And that ' s the Tonga underworld.
Would you mind taking the insects ?  Thank you darling.
So , you ' ll be on Mars , and you ' re at Hellespointica Depressio which has got to be a really  " up "  place.
Then to Niliacus Lacus , which is not a bad name.
And then of course Arnon to Thoth.
L ' Union Astronomique Internationale , for those of you who don ' t speak French.
And I think that Djabran Fluctus , that fits that mode.
 " Yeah , that ' s the goat goddess right ?  The Abacazanian ? 
Anyone can suggest changing a name.
I did some more investigation.
Something is askew here.
I don ' t know . But it ' s investigative material , no doubt.
 " Mom , I want to make maps. " 
Martians , Venusians , Jovians.
Getting back to my premise , I used stamps , by the way , because you don ' t have to pay anybody for the rights.
And within numbers , is there an underlying secret to the universe ? 
So , formulas relate number to form.
He ' s got no body , no man , just a head floating high.
The dodecahedron , it ' s dual.
Blue cheese , ranch , oil and vinegar , thousand islands and house.
And you can see how the icosahedron withdraws into the dodecahedron and then they just merge into each other.
October 9th , in France , Jean-Pierre Luminet said that the universe is probably shaped like a dodecahedron , based on information that they got from this probe.
So , you can kind of get an idea from this extrapolating that back under this huge picture , so we get this idea of what the primal universe looked like.
Everybody goes , I ' m happy.
Except for that creepy guy in the background.
Now this is Isaac from a Vietnamese stamp.
That guy is rockin ' .
I don ' t get that at all.
This is Sierra Leone.
When did this happen ? 
Ecuador , my friend Kepler , as you can see , they call him Juan.
He ' s all murky . There is little kids leaning on his leg , little ghosts flying around . We gotta clean this stuff up fast , ladies and gentlemen.
Because that ' s why we ' re here , really , I think to figure stuff out and to love each other.
Now , Monaco is problematic for me , and I ' ll show you why.
This is the flag of Monaco . Ladies and gentlemen , the flag of Indonesia . Please examine.
Look , ours is more red , it ' s longer.
That ' s Jude Law and some of his films recently didn ' t work.
Prime numbers , Gauss , one of my favorites.
If Fibonacci had been on Paxil , that would be the Fibonacci series.
Alright where is this going ?  That ' s a good question.
And I tried to build a particle accelerator.
That ' s what I did . That ' s how I found Moleeds.
You can see , even if you don ' t go for the numbers , the beauty of the symmetry.
Bottom , all 74.
Once again , the Cartesian kind of cross-over.
This is beyond anything anybody could just make up.
That ' s the Green System . It all folds in half on the Green System , right between 18 and 19.
Twenty-seven years of my life!
In this last year I have found these subsequent systems which allow for the mathematic possibilities of the Calabi-Yau manifolds in a way that doesn ' t necessitate these little hidden dimensions.
I found other pairs all have symmetry , even though , unlike the master one , their symmetry is split.
You know , try making some charts like this at home.
Okay , I ' m getting to the punch . Golden Ratio , it ' s crazy.
I go to JPL.
Kepler was right.
Hey , you can ' t make this up.

If you have followed diplomatic news in the past weeks , you may have heard of a kind of crisis between China and the U.S.
However , this episode reveals the growing anxiety in the Western world regarding these emerging cyber weapons.
In 1982 , in the middle of the Cold War in Soviet Siberia , a pipeline exploded with a burst of 3 kilotons , the equivalent of a fourth of the Hiroshima bomb.
And with these keys , they may have been able to get inside CENTCOM ' s systems , to see and hear everything , and maybe even infect some of them.
And across the world today , we see a sort of cyber arms race , with cyberwar units built up by countries like North Korea or even Iran.
which was indeed the case in Europe between 1650 and 1750.
The first issue : Imagine a potential enemy announcing they ' re building a cyberwar unit , but only for their country ' s defense.
But today both countries say the best defense is to attack.
This gives a tremendous advantage to the attacker , because the defender doesn ' t know who to fight back against.
Estonia accused Russia.
On the other hand , we know that these weapons give an advantage to attacking.
So cyber weapons are dangerous by nature , but in addition , they ' re emerging in a much more unstable environment.
Why ?  Because no nation knows for sure whether its neighbor is about to attack.
In May 2009 , General Kevin Chilton , commander of the U.S . nuclear forces , stated that in the event of cyberattacks against the U.S. , all options would be on the table.

Jim Toomey : Learning from Sherman the shark
So how did I get started cartooning ? 
And I was particularly fascinated with sharks.
Before that day , this is how I saw the ocean.
There ' s been a lot of folklore developed around the ocean , mostly negative.
But that day I flew low over the islands -- it was a family trip to the Caribbean , and I flew in a small plane low over the islands.
And best of all , I saw the animals.
Up until that day , these were the animals that were most common in my life.
And the differences in scale between this tiny sea dragon and this enormous humpback whale was like something out of a science-fiction movie.
So if you ever fantasize about going back in time and seeing what a dinosaur looked like , that ' s what a dinosaur looks like.
Could you image if we looked through the Hubble Telescope and we saw that ? 
So , what I ' d like to do now is try a little drawing.
But it ' s easy to see why these animals make such great cartoon characters , their shapes and sizes.
They can sense the magnetic fields of the earth.
It ' s not an animal we draw cartoons of or draw at all.
He can ' t spin a web anytime ; he ' s got to pull his pants down first.
I ' m going to draw this blowfish uninflated.
 " You talkin '  to me ?  "  See , he can inflate himself when he wants to be intimidating.
Or this lionfish for instance.
He ' s a great white shark.
He ' s sort of a Homer Simpson with fins.
He never seems to settle on any particular girl.
Sometimes making a story is as easy as putting two characters in a room and seeing what happens.
I ' ve taken them to the Sea of Japan , where they met giant jellyfish.
But it was a chance for me to introduce readers to a lot of crazy undersea characters.
I did another story on marine debris.
Plastic just is not going to do it. " 
So what I did was I made an adventure strip.
So , I sent them to Boise , Idaho , where they dropped a plastic bottle into the Boise sewer system.
The third storyline I did about a year and a half ago was probably my most difficult.
It ' s cruel , it ' s wasteful.
And then he dies.
So I got a lot of reader feedback on that one.
This is what I love about comic strips , you know.
Meanwhile , Ernest finds his fins on the internet.
I ended that series with a kind of a mail-in petition that encouraged our National Marine Fishery Service , to force other countries to have a stronger stance with shark management.
Imagine you ' re in an enormous room , and it ' s as dark as a cave.
It ' s big , it ' s heavy . You can ' t carry it away , so you bang it with your hammer , and you break off a piece.
So you go back into the room , and you break this thing to pieces , and you haul it away.
So you get this sense of urgency , like you need to find as much stuff as possible as soon as possible.
And you ' ve taken all this complexity and beauty , and you ' ve turned it into a cheap commodity.
And that ' s what I hope my comic strip does in a small way.
Ethnographer Wade Davis explores hidden places in the wider world -- but in this powerful short talk he urges us to save a paradise in his backyard , Northern Canada . The Sacred Headwaters , remote and pristine , are under threat because they hide rich tar sands . With stunning photos , Davis asks a tough question : How can we balance society ' s need for fuels with the urge to protect such glorious wilderness ? 
This is not a story of Tibet and it ' s not a story of the Amazon.
It ' s a valley where , in a long day , perhaps , too , you can follow the tracks of grizzly and wolf and drink from the very sources of water that gave rise and cradled the great civilizations of the Northwest Coast.
He came back to California and named his dog after that river of enchantment.
My job description was deliciously vague : wilderness assessment and public relations.
And over the course of 30 years , I recorded traditional tales from Alex , mostly mythological accounts of Wy-ghet , the trickster transformer of Gitxsan lore who , in his folly , taught the people how to live on the land.
Well , isolation has been the great saving grace of this remarkable place , but today isolation could be its doom.
At the Headwaters itself , Shell Canada has plans to extract methane gas from coal seams that underly a million acres , fracking the coal with hundreds of millions of gallons of toxic chemicals , establishing perhaps as many as 6,000 wellheads , and eventually a network of roads and pipelines and flaring wellheads , all to generate methane gas that most likely will go east to fuel the expansion of the tar sands.
It ' s a sanctuary . It ' s a burial ground of their ancestors.
The Tahltan have called for the creation of a tribal heritage reserve which will set aside the largest protected area in British Columbia.

Arthur Benjamin does  " Mathemagic " 
But before I get started , I have a quick question for the audience.
Now bring it out , bring it out . Anybody else ? 
And let ' s give these volunteers a nice round of applause.
Audience : 22.
Woman : No.
What I ' m going to try and do then -- I notice that took some of you a little bit of time to get your answer.
Audience : 25.
What I ' ll use is the second row this time , and I ' ll get four of you -- one , two , three , four -- to each yell out a two-digit number , and if you would square the first number , and if you would square the second , the third and the fourth , I will try and race you to the answer . OK ? 
Audience : 23.
Audience : 93.
AB : 529.
AB : Thank you very much.
Anyone I point to , call out a three-digit number.
Audience : 987.
Audience : 457.
Audience : 321.
AB : 722 is 500 -- ooh , that ' s a harder one.
Audience : 162.
To make this a little bit more random , let ' s take the fourth row this time , let ' s say , one , two , three , four.
Audience : Seven . AB : Seven.
95,218,564 ? 
Eight-digit capacity -- don ' t you hate that ? 
Man : I can probably do it.
Would you each enter that on your calculator ? 
Seven , and yours ?  Woman : Seven.
AB : Seven . Is there any possible way that I could know what seven digit numbers you have ?  Say  " No. " 
So , starting with your seven-digit number , call out any six of them please.
You have a seven-digit number , call out any six of them please.
Man : 079044.
Really scramble them up this time , please.
For my next number -- while I mentally recharge my batteries , I have one more question for the audience.
What year ? 
Audience : 23rd.
Audience : 1949 . AB : 1949 , and the month ? 
Yes , my -- I ' ll go way to the back right now , how about you ? 
AB : February what ?  Audience : Sixth.
Audience : 1947 . AB : 1947 , and the month ? 
AB : Thank you very much.
I brought with me a book of calendars.
This is a book of calendars , and I ' ll ask -- who was it that wanted to know their birth day ?  You sir ?  OK.
Audience : April . AB : April what ? 
What year , Chris , would you like ? 
AB : June what ?  CA : Sixth.
But I ' d like to wrap things up now by alluding to something from earlier in the presentation.
OK , oh , OK -- you have a 10-digit calculator , sir , as well ? 
Now , I have to apologize to our magician friend Lennart Green.
Call out a single digit -- that will be the five-digit number that I will try to square . Go ahead.
Audience : Three . AB : Three.
I ' ll do 57,000 squared , plus 683 squared , plus 57,000 times 683 times two.
While I do these calculation[s] , you might hear certain words , as opposed to numbers , creep into the calculation.
I know it sounds complicated ; it ' s not -- I just don ' t want you to think you ' re seeing something out of  " Rain Man "  here.
If , however , I am right , whatever you do , don ' t keep it to yourself , OK ? 
Now , 57 times 68 is 3,400 , plus 476 is 3876 , that ' s 38,760 plus 171 , 38,760 plus 171 is 38,931.
Next , I do 57 squared , which is 3,249 , so I can say , three billion . Take the 249 , add that to cookie , 249 , oops , but I see a carry coming -- 249 -- add that to cookie , 250 plus 77 , is 327 million -- fission , fission , OK , finally , we do 683 squared , that ' s 700 times 666 , plus 17 squared is 466,489 , rev up if I need it , rev up , take the 466 , add that to fission , to get , oh gee -- 328,489.

Clifford Stoll on .. . everything
First off , my badge says I ' m an astronomer.
And I caught the guys , and they turned out to be working for what was then the Soviet KGB , and stealing information and selling it.
I ' m -- The first time you do something , it ' s science.
So , I ' m not going to talk about that.
Get them out of schools , and keep them out of schools.
Having said that , I outlined my talk about five minutes ago.
In fact , I think that if you really want to know what the future ' s going to be , if you really want to know about the future , don ' t ask a technologist , a scientist , a physicist.
In fact , don ' t ask just any kindergarten teacher , ask an experienced one.
But to me , things aren ' t the future.
I ' d love to talk about it , it ' d be fun , but I want to talk about what I ' m doing now . What am I doing now ? 
Because I love Mobius loops . I not only love Mobius loops , but I ' m one of the very few people , if not the only person in the world , that makes Klein bottles.
It ' s one sided . It ' s a bottle whose inside is its outside.
And I ' d love to talk to you about this , but I don ' t have much in the way of .. . things to say because -- However , the  " D "  in TED of course stands for design.
And because our universe is only three spatial dimensions , it can hold fluids.
Instead , I ' m going to mention my mom , who passed away last summer.
And I looked at it , and said , oh my god , that was me , when I was working at the electronic music studio!
Soon after that , I found in another picture that she had , a picture of me.
A musician who took time from his life to teach me , a sophomore , a freshman at SUNY Buffalo.
Mentoring me . He ' d come up and spend hours and hours with me.
Bob Moog came by and hauled a whole pile of equipment to show Greg Flint and I things about this.
And I ' ll just say what I ' m about to do . What I ' m about to do -- I hope you can recognize that there ' s a distorted sine wave , almost a triangular wave upon this Hewlett-Packard oscilloscope.
I ' ve decided that , for me at least , I don ' t have a big enough head.
I was talking about this stuff to some schoolteachers about a year ago.
Put your money where you mouth is. " 
I take lunch hour.
Teach a solid week . Okay , I ' m teaching three-quarters time , but good enough.
But you will need to know eighth-grade algebra , and we ' re going to do serious experiments.
Oh , before I even turn that on , one of the things that we did about three weeks ago in my class -- this is through the lens , and one of the things we used a lens for was to measure the speed of light.
I ' d love to measure the speed of light here.
So , next time , maybe , I ' ll measure the speed of light!
And all of you know the wave equation is the frequency times the wavelength of any wave ...
What they didn ' t tell you in physics -- in eighth-grade physics -- but they should have , and I wish they had , was that if you multiply the frequency times the wavelength of sound or light , you get a constant.
Set it up to around A , above A , above A . There ' s an A , more or less.
So anytime I talk , you ' d see it on the screen.
To measure the wavelength , all I need to do is measure the distance from here -- one full wave -- over to here.
0.2 meters from here , back to here , 20 centimeters.
Let ' s figure out what this is.
All of which comes to what I wanted to say.
I ' m going home for a midterm . A riot ' s going on on campus.
Pulls out a gun . Goes boom!
He wants to clunk me over the head!
The cop ' s chasing me.
I slam the door behind me , climb up , go past this place where I see a pendulum ticking.
There ' s a clock , clock , clock , clock.
I pop up the top , and there ' s a cupola.
Then I remember what my English teacher in high school said.
So , at this time , I ' d like to tell you the words inscribed upon the Hayes Hall tower bells :  " All truth is one.
Writer and designer Graham Hill asks : Can having less stuff , in less room , lead to more happiness ?  He makes the case for taking up less space , and lays out three rules for editing your life.
What ' s in the box ? 
Three times.
So we ' ve got triple the space , but we ' ve become such good shoppers that we need even more space.
I bet most of us have experienced at some point the joys of less : college -- in your dorm , traveling -- in a hotel room , camping -- rig up basically nothing , maybe a boat.
And it ' s going to give you a little more ease in your life.
With over 300 entries from around the world , I got it , my own little jewel box.
And because it ' s really designed around an edited set of possessions -- my favorite stuff -- and really designed for me , I ' m really excited to be there.
We ' ve got to clear the arteries of our lives.
We need to think before we buy.
Secondly , our new mantra : small is sexy.
So we want things that nest , we want things that stack , and we want it digitized.
Look at the coffee table -- it grows in height and width to seat 10.
And of course , my own movie theater.
Most of us , maybe all of us , are here pretty happily for a bunch of days with a couple of bags , maybe a small space , a hotel room.
What ' s in the box ? 
Maybe , just maybe , less might equal more.

It ' s got to be serious if the New York Times puts a cover story of their February 17th Sunday magazine about play.
Not bad , except if you look at that cover , what ' s missing ? 
All ages , solo play , body play , games , taunting.
North of Churchill , Manitoba , in October and November , there ' s no ice on Hudson Bay.
Any of you who ' ve been to Africa or had a junkyard dog come after you , there is a fixed kind of predatory gaze that you know you ' re in trouble.
And this polar bear stands over the husky , no claws extended , no fangs taking a look.
And if you ' ll begin to look closely at the husky that ' s bearing her throat to the polar bear , and look a little more closely , they ' re in an altered state.
And it is a marvelous example of how a differential in power can be overridden by a process of nature that ' s within all of us.
Charles Whitman was his name.
And it was many years in taking play histories of individuals before I really began to recognize that I didn ' t really have a full understanding of it.
When that mother and infant lock eyes , and the infant ' s old enough to have a social smile , what happens -- spontaneously -- is the eruption of joy on the part of the mother.
And so now I ' m going to take you through sort of a way of looking at play , but it ' s never just singularly one thing.
And you may feel like this character , who is also just doing it for its own sake.
And this Japanese macaque has made a snowball , and he or she ' s going to roll down a hill.
They have located two consultants , Frank Wilson and Nate Johnson , who are -- Frank Wilson is a neurologist , Nate Johnson is a mechanic.
They got together -- JPL hired them.
But it has to be safe exploration.
And social play is part of what we ' re about here today , and is a byproduct of the play scene.
And rough-and-tumble play is a great learning medium for all of us.
But take a look at the face and the body language of everybody in this fuzzy picture , and you can get a sense that they ' re all at play.
And I love this one , because it ' s also what we ' re about.
Well , this bushman , I think , is talking about the fish that got away that was that long , but it ' s a fundamental part of the play scene.
I walked into the Carnegie asking for a grant.
Three-dimensional play fires up the cerebellum , puts a lot of impulses into the frontal lobe -- the executive portion -- helps contextual memory be developed , and -- and , and , and.
I ' m sorry I don ' t have a playful-looking subject , but it allows mobility , which has limited the actual study of play.
In the animal world , if you take rats , who are hardwired to play at a certain period of their juvenile years and you suppress play -- they squeak , they wrestle , they pin each other , that ' s part of their play.
They both hide out.
And , and , and -- there are a lot more animal studies that I could talk about.
Now , the program says that the opposite of play is not work , it ' s depression.
And we all have capacity to play signal.
The basis of human trust is established through play signals.
Now , Jane Goodall has here a play face along with one of her favorite chimps.
Because neoteny means the retention of immature qualities into adulthood.
Now , there is a way of looking at play that I also want to emphasize here , which is the play history.
Found that when he looked at a playground out of a window into which he had been confined , he felt something different.
Now there ' s another play history that I think is a work in progress.
He had the expectations of his senatorial father and Washington , D.C.
And you ' ll find , you may change jobs -- which has happened to a number people when I ' ve had them do this -- in order to be more empowered through their play.
This is our maiden voyage in this.
So we ' ve had Brendan , who ' s from IDEO , and the rest of us sitting aside and watching these students as they put play principles into practice in the classroom.
Characterized by a feeling of energized focus , full involvement and success in the process of the activity.
Some sage and repeatedly furry monks at this place called the d.school designed a meeting that you can literally step out of when it ' s over.
Because when you put it on , you immediately get everything you need to have a fun and productive and useful meeting.
Thank You.
If you stop a cat from playing -- which you can do , and we ' ve all seen how cats bat around stuff -- they ' re just as good predators as they would be if they hadn ' t played.
And if you look at sleep and dreams biologically , animals sleep and dream , and they rehearse and they do some other things that help memory and that are a very important part of sleep and dreams.
So it ' s not just something you do in your spare time.
How do you prevent people from taking that sort of action on the data that you ' re developing ? 
And you get them into a group together focused on play , and it ' s pretty hard not to take it seriously.
JH : Stuart Brown , thank you very much.

And here ' s how news shapes what Americans see.
And in Paris , the IPCC released its study confirming man ' s impact on global warming.
When we analyzed all the news stories and removed just one story , here ' s how the world looked.
So , why don ' t we hear more about the world ? 
And this lack of global coverage is all the more disturbing when we see where people go for news.
Last year , Pew and the Colombia J-School analyzed the 14,000 stories that appeared on Google News '  front page.
And if you think it ' s simply because we are not interested , you would be wrong.
And can we afford not to ?  Thank you.

BR : And we ' re chefs . So when Moto opened in 2004 , people didn ' t really know what to expect . A lot of people thought that it was a Japanese restaurant , and maybe it was the name , maybe it was the logo , which was like a Japanese character , but anyway , we had all these requests for Japanese food , which is really not what we did . And after about the ten thousandth request for a maki roll , we decided to give the people what they wanted . So this picture is an example of printed food , and this was the first foray into what we like to call flavor transformation . So this is all the ingredients , all the flavor of , you know , a standard maki roll , printed onto a little piece of paper.
BR : But it ' s not all just edible pictures.
HC : And here ' s something we have no reference to eat . This is a cigar , and basically it ' s a Cuban cigar made out of a Cuban pork sandwich , so we take these spices that go into the pork shoulder , we fashion that into ash . We take the sandwich and wrap it up in a collard green , put an edible label that bears no similarity to a Cohiba cigar label , and we put it in a dollar ninety-nine ashtray and charge you about twenty bucks for it.
So this is a plate of nachos.
So when you ' re looking at this thing in the dining room , you have this sensation that this is actually a plate of nachos , and it ' s not really until you begin tasting it that you realize this is a dessert , and it ' s just kind of like a mind-ripper.
HC : Let ' s talk about flavor transformation , and let ' s actually make some cool stuff.
So the cow , basically , eats three basic things in their feed : corn , beets , and barley , and so what I do is I actually challenge my staff with these crazy , wild ideas . Can we take what the cow eats , remove the cow , and then make some hamburgers out of that ? 
There ' s a lot of research and a lot of failure , trial and error -- I guess , more error -- that goes into each and every dish , so we don ' t always get it right , and it takes a while for us to be able to explain that to people.
BR : And it ' s definitely the world ' s first bleeding veggie burger , which is a cool side effect.
Let ' s just stop and think about the economic benefits of something like that.
So after we do that , we put it into a vacuum bag , add a little bit of seaweed , some spices , and we roll it , and this starts taking on the appearance of tuna.
As long as it ' s good for you and good for the environment , it doesn ' t matter.
I told the staff , let ' s just take a bunch of wild plants , think of them as food ingredients . As long as they ' re non-poisonous to the human body , go out around Chicago sidewalks , take it , blend it , cook it and then have everybody flavor-trip on it at Moto.
HC : So this is where we step into the future and we leapfrog ahead.
And basically we took hay and crab apples and made barbecue sauce out of those two ingredients.
Virus hunter Nathan Wolfe is outwitting the next pandemic by staying two steps ahead : discovering deadly new viruses where they first emerge -- passing from animals to humans among poor subsistence hunters in Africa -- before they claim millions of lives.
When most people think about the beginnings of AIDS , they ' re gonna think back to the 1980s.
At this time , there were thousands of individuals , we think , that were infected with HIV.
In fact , this is not unique to HIV . The vast majority of viruses come from animals.
So during the last 15 years , I ' ve been working to actually study the earlier interface here -- what I ' ve labeled  " viral chatter, "  which was a term coined by my mentor Don Burke.
It ' s actually a fairly common picture.
And so we ' ve been studying people like this individual.
And the basic objective of this work is not to just go out once and look at these individuals , but to establish thousands of individuals in these populations that we would monitor continuously on a regular basis.
When they sample from animals , they collect the blood on the filter paper and this allows us to identify yet-unknown viruses from exactly the right animals -- the ones that are actually being hunted.
Patrice and Patee set out most days to go out hunting in the forest around their homes.
We stop for a drink of water.
Nathan Wolfe : This species , yeah . And there ' s many many more pathogens that are present in these animals.
The blood will be tested for zoonotic viruses , part of a program Dr . Wolfe has spent years setting up.
OK ?  And you can consider all sorts of different bush meat.
They ' re also going to ask you the question that when we knew that this was the way that HIV entered into the human population , and that other diseases had the potential to enter like this , why did we let these behaviors continue ? 
It ' s one that I think we all need to ask ourselves , which is , why we thought the responsibility rested with this individual here.
Bush meat is one of the central crises , which is occurring in our population right now , in humanity , on this planet.
So , in 1998 , along with my mentors Don Burke and Colonel Mpoudi-Ngole , we went to actually start this work in Central Africa , to work with hunters in this part of the world.
Needless to say , I was drastically wrong.
One of them is just obtaining trust from individuals that we work with in the field.
Paul worked for years on the Cameroonian national radio and television , and he spoke about health issues . He was a health correspondent.
And this was somebody who had incredible potential to spread aspects of our message , whether it be with regards to wildlife conservation or health prevention.
But the reason I like to show the shot is because you can see that he ' s about to solve this problem.
This is what it looks like now.
And here ' s a shot of me , this is the before shot of me.
And what we ' ve found is that if you look in the right place , you can actually monitor the flow of these viruses into human populations.
It ' s something we should be following . It ' s not something that we should be surprised by.
So , once we discovered that it was really possible that we could actually do this monitoring , we decided to move this from research , to really attempt to phase up to a global monitoring effort.
It ' s also working in live animal markets -- these wet markets -- which is exactly the place where SARS emerged in Asia.
It had potential to really change the way that we saw ourselves , and thought about ourselves.
This is honestly the most exciting period ever for the study of unknown life forms on our planet.
Golan Levin , an artist and engineer , uses modern tools -- robotics , new software , cognitive research -- to make artworks that surprise and delight . Watch as sounds become shapes , bodies create paintings , and a curious eye looks back at the curious viewer.
Hello! My name is Golan Levin.
It ' s a letter from  " Artforum "  in 1967 saying  " We can ' t imagine ever doing a special issue on electronics or computers in art. "  And they still haven ' t.
So , from both directions , there is kind of , I think , a lack of understanding about what it could mean to be an artist who uses the materials of his own day , or her own day , which I think artists are obliged to do , is to really explore the expressive potential of the new tools that we have.
This a photograph of the desktop of a student of mine.
And the thing I ' m really trying to do is enabling people to have more rich kinds of interactive experiences.
Because this is , in some sense , the first way , that people discover their own potential as actors , and discover their own agency.
So as people make shapes with their hands or their heads and so forth , or with each other , these shapes literally produce sounds and drop out of thin air -- basically taking what ' s often this , kind of , unseen space , or this undetected space , and making it something real , that people then can appreciate and become creative with.
Song is one of our oldest ways of making ourselves heard and understood.
Anyone want to hazard a guess ? 
And so , whereas Dr . Oliver Sacks has talked about how perhaps one person in a million actually has true synesthesia , where they hear colors or taste shapes , and things like this , phonaesthesia is something we can all experience to some extent.
So it occurred to me , what happens if we could run these backwards ? 
And as you do , you see the shadows of your own speech.
So let ' s bring up a video of that.
But Jaap is one of the world experts in performing it.
Here you can see the set-up where there is a screen with the subtitles behind him.
And then a bunch of people who were like ,  " What ' s the big deal ? 
It ' s a really profound amount of nonverbal information that ' s communicated with the eyes.
And basically to ask the questions : What if art was aware that we were looking at it ? 
In the first one which I ' m going to show you , called Eyecode , it ' s a piece of interactive software in which , if we read this little circle ,  " the trace left by the looking of the previous observer looks at the trace left by the looking of previous observer. " 
Okay . Ah , there is lots of nice bright video.
Hello ?  And I can .. . hello .. . okay.
But if I come up really close and stare directly at the camera on this laptop then you ' ll see these nice crisp eyes.
And this exists in larger installations where there are thousands and thousands of eyes that people could be staring at , as you see who ' s looking at the people looking at the people looking before them.
So that ' s this kind of recursive observation system.
In this case , the Opto-Isolator is blinking in response to one ' s own blinks.
And at the same time , it attempts to engage in what you might call familiar psycho-social gaze behaviors.
And inside it ' s got an 800-pound robot arm that I borrowed , from a friend.
The idea is that basically -- if it ' s constantly like  " Huh ?  .. . Huh ?  " 
 " Got something on my hair ?  "  Here we go . Alright.
Those are its targets.
But also have the body language communicate something to the person who is looking at it.

Evan Williams on listening to Twitter users
We were also playing with SMS at the time at Odeo , so we kind of put two and two together , and in early 2006 we launched Twitter as a side project at Odeo.
So , for those of you unfamiliar , Twitter is based around a very simple , seemingly trivial concept.
It ' s a normal everyday thing.
This was the primary use we saw for Twitter from the beginning , and what got us excited.
But it wasn ' t just individuals.
Politicians have recently begun Twittering.
The President himself is our most popular Twitter user , although his tweets have dropped off as of late , while Senator McCain ' s have picked up.
So , this syntax , the  " @username "  that Shaquille O ' Neal ' s using here to reply to one of his fans , was completely invented by users , and we didn ' t build it into the system until it already became popular and then we made it easier.
We currently know about over 2,000 pieces of software that can send Twitter updates -- interfaces for Mac , Windows , your iPhone , your BlackBerry -- as well as things like a device that lets an unborn baby Twitter when it kicks or a plant Twitter when it needs water.
This really changed how we perceived Twitter.
This not only lets you view Twitters in different ways , but it introduces new use cases as well.
It ' s happened more and more lately , whether it ' s raising money for homeless people or to dig wells in Africa or for a family in crisis.
I ' ve learned to follow the hunch , but never assume where it will go.
It ' s totally intimidating.
 " .. . give people more information and follow your hunch @ #TED. " 
Worst talk ever! " 
So he ' ll see every aspect of the reaction : the fact that Barack Obama is the biggest Twitterer , the fact that it came out of TED ...
That was very interesting . EW : Thank you.

I grew up on a university campus in eastern Nigeria.
Now , this despite the fact that I lived in Nigeria.
Never mind that I had no idea what ginger beer was.
Because all I had read were books in which characters were foreign , I had become convinced that books by their very nature had to have foreigners in them and had to be about things with which I could not personally identify.
I realized that people like me , girls with skin the color of chocolate , whose kinky hair could not form ponytails , could also exist in literature.
But the unintended consequence was that I did not know that people like me could exist in literature.
My mother was an administrator.
The only thing my mother told us about him was that his family was very poor.
Then one Saturday we went to his village to visit , and his mother showed us a beautifully patterned basket made of dyed raffia that his brother had made.
Their poverty was my single story of them.
She asked where I had learned to speak English so well , and was confused when I said that Nigeria happened to have English as its official language.
Her default position toward me , as an African , was a kind of patronizing , well-meaning pity.
But in the U.S . whenever Africa came up people turned to me.
So after I had spent some years in the U.S . as an African , I began to understand my roommate ' s response to me.
Now , here is a quote from the writing of a London merchant called John Locke , who sailed to west Africa in 1561 and kept a fascinating account of his voyage.
But what is important about his writing is that it represents the beginning of a tradition of telling African stories in the West : A tradition of Sub-Saharan Africa as a place of negatives , of difference , of darkness , of people who , in the words of the wonderful poet Rudyard Kipling , are  " half devil , half child. " 
The professor told me that my characters were too much like him , an educated and middle-class man.
But I must quickly add that I too am just as guilty in the question of the single story.
There were endless stories of Mexicans as people who were fleecing the healthcare system , sneaking across the border , being arrested at the border , that sort of thing.
I realized that I had been so immersed in the media coverage of Mexicans that they had become one thing in my mind , the abject immigrant.
There is a word , an Igbo word , that I think about whenever I think about the power structures of the world , and it is  " nkali. " 
The Palestinian poet Mourid Barghouti writes that if you want to dispossess a people , the simplest way to do it is to tell their story and to start with ,  " secondly. " 
I told him that I had just read a novel called American Psycho -- -- and that it was such a shame that young Americans were serial murderers.
I had read Tyler and Updike and Steinbeck and Gaitskill.
But I also had grandfathers who died in refugee camps.
And so , as a child , I saw jam disappear from the breakfast table , then margarine disappeared , then bread became too expensive , then milk became rationed.
The single story creates stereotypes , and the problem with stereotypes is not that they are untrue , but that they are incomplete.
I ' ve always felt that it is impossible to engage properly with a place or a person without engaging with all of the stories of that place and that person.
So what if before my Mexican trip I had followed the immigration debate from both sides , the U.S . and the Mexican ? 
What if my roommate knew about my Nigerian publisher , Mukta Bakaray , a remarkable man who left his job in a bank to follow his dream and start a publishing house ? 
Now you must write a sequel , and this is what will happen ... " 
She had not only read the book , but she had taken ownership of it and felt justified in telling me what to write in the sequel.
What if my roommate knew about the female lawyer who recently went to court in Nigeria to challenge a ridiculous law that required women to get their husband ' s consent before renewing their passports ? 
Every time I am home I am confronted with the usual sources of irritation for most Nigerians : our failed infrastructure , our failed government , but also by the incredible resilience of people who thrive despite the government , rather than because of it.
Many stories matter.
She introduced them to a book about the Southern life that they had left behind :  " They sat around , reading the book themselves , listening to me read the book , and a kind of paradise was regained. "

In Washington , the president of the United States is sitting in the Oval Office , assessing whether or not to strike Al Qaeda in Yemen.
We face momentous decisions with important consequences throughout our lives , and we have strategies for dealing with these decisions.
And in an age that is sometimes nowadays frightening or confusing , we feel reassured by the almost parental-like authority of experts who tell us so clearly what it is we can and cannot do.
We ' ve become addicted to their certainty , their assuredness , their definitiveness , and in the process , we have ceded our responsibility , substituting our intellect and our intelligence for their supposed words of wisdom.
The results were quite extraordinary.
But experts do get things wrong.
For the sake of our health , our wealth and our collective security , it ' s imperative that we keep the independent decision-making parts of our brains switched on.
But what my research has shown me is that experts tend on the whole to form very rigid camps , that within these camps , a dominant perspective emerges that often silences opposition , that experts move with the prevailing winds , often hero-worshipping their own gurus.
The study showed that food companies exaggerated typically seven times more than an independent study.
A common thinking error of radiologists , for example -- when they look at CT scans -- is that they ' re overly influenced by whatever it is that the referring physician has said that he suspects the patient ' s problem to be.
But how can we do this ? 
in every single subject , you ' ll be relieved to hear.
What is the evidence upon which this is based ? 
It seems that they ' ve somehow overlooked the fact that over half the world ' s population are women.
If we are to shift paradigms , if we are to make breakthroughs , if we are to destroy myths , we need to create an environment in which expert ideas are battling it out , in which we ' re bringing in new , diverse , discordant , heretical views into the discussion , fearlessly , in the knowledge that progress comes about , not only from the creation of ideas , but also from their destruction -- and also from the knowledge that , by surrounding ourselves by divergent , discordant , heretical views.
Google CEO Eric Schmidt is a practical practitioner of this philosophy.
We need to fundamentally redefine who it is that experts are.
By leveraging and by embracing the expertise within the company , Best Buy was able to discover , for example , that the store that it was going to open in China -- its big , grand store -- was not going to open on time.
For if we keep our independent decision-making part of our brains switched on , if we challenge experts , if we ' re skeptical , if we devolve authority , if we are rebellious , but also if we become much more comfortable with nuance , uncertainty and doubt , and if we allow our experts to express themselves using those terms too , we will set ourselves up much better for the challenges of the 21st century.
Richard Dawkins urges all atheists to openly state their position -- and to fight the incursion of the church into politics and science . A fiery , funny , powerful talk.
That splendid music , the coming-in music --  " The Elephant March "  from  " Aida "  -- is the music I ' ve chosen for my funeral -- -- and you can see why . It ' s triumphal.
Robert Full and Frans Lanting and others -- the beauty of the things they showed.
In professional circles everywhere , it ' s of course universally accepted.
If you want to know what I have to say about Darwinism itself , I ' m afraid you ' re going to have to look at my books , which you won ' t find in the bookstore outside.
The arguments of so-called ID theorists are the same old arguments that had been refuted again and again , since Darwin down to the present day.
Teach your children evolution in biology class , and they ' ll soon move on to drugs , grand larceny and sexual pre-version.
People like me , on the other hand , rock the boat.
I think they ' re right that evolution is fundamentally hostile to religion.
In an audience as sophisticated as this one , that would be preaching to the choir.
Now , the difficult problem for any theory of biological design is to explain the massive statistical improbability of living things.
This argument of course , shoots itself in the foot.
Essentially , it does it by providing a smooth ramp of gradual step-by-step increment.
It turns out to be , in principle , incapable of doing the job required of it.
Richard Dawkins : He was . Good . I thought he must have been.
It has certain ideas at the heart of it , which we call  ' sacred '  or  ' holy. '  What it means is : here is an idea or a notion that you ' re not allowed to say anything bad about.
 " Everybody gets absolutely frantic about it , because you ' re not allowed to say these things , yet when you look at it rationally , there is no reason why those ideas shouldn ' t be as open to debate as any other , except that we ' ve agreed somehow between us that they shouldn ' t be. "  And that ' s the end of the quote from Douglas.
There ' s Douglas Adams , magnificent picture from his book ,  " Last Chance to See. " 
Perfectly ordinary scientific paper.
 " Professor Hawkins Has Promulgated an Official Dogma Binding on All Loyal Hawkinsians That an Asteroid Killed the Dinosaurs. " 
Mr . Bush ' s reply has become infamous.
He stood by it in the face of repeated calls for clarification or withdrawal.
What would Thomas Jefferson have said ? 
As has been said before , we are all atheists about most of the gods that humanity has ever believed in . Some of us just go one god further.
Natalie Angier wrote a rather sad piece in the New Yorker , saying how lonely she felt as an atheist.
But what would you think was the second largest group , convincingly outnumbering Jews with 2.8 million , Muslims at 1.1 million , and Hindus , Buddhists and all other religions put together ? 
This secular non-religious vote , if properly mobilized , is nine times as numerous as the Jewish vote.
The survey that I quoted , which is the ARIS survey , didn ' t break down its data by socio-economic class or education , IQ or anything else.
That is , the higher one ' s intelligence or educational level , the less one is likely to be religious. " 
In 1998 , Larson and Witham polled the cream of American scientists , those who ' d been honored by election to the National Academy of Sciences , and among this select group , belief in a personal God dropped to a shattering seven percent.
I ' ve not seen corresponding figures for elite scholars in other fields , such history or philosophy , but I ' d be surprised if they were different.
To put it bluntly , American political opportunities are heavily loaded against those who are simultaneously intelligent and honest.
Again , I fear it will cost money.
On the contrary , they ' ll demonstrate that atheists are often the kinds of people that could serve as decent role models for your children , the kinds of people an advertising agent could use to recommend a product , the kinds of people who are sitting in this room.
And again , it will need money.
I think that generally an  ' agnostic '  would be the most correct description of my state of mind. " 
It ' s a sort of urban myth , that Marx tried to dedicate  " Kapital "  to Darwin.
Darwin thought that atheism might be well and good for the intelligentsia , but that ordinary people were not , quote ,  " ripe for it. " 
You think we might have grown up since then.
Hence the phrase ,  " tooth fairy agnostic. " 
If you want to believe one particular one of them -- unicorns or tooth fairies or teapots or Yahweh -- the onus is on you to say why.
Nonetheless , if we want to attract deep down atheists to come out publicly , we ' re going to have find something better to stick on our banner than  " tooth fairy "  or  " teapot agnostic. " 
One of the things we ' ve learned from Darwin is that the human species is only one among millions of cousins , some close , some distant.
It lacks the strong connotation that there ' s definitely no God , and it could therefore easily be embraced by teapot or tooth fairy agnostics.
But I think , actually , the alternative is to grasp the nettle of the word  " atheism "  itself , precisely because it is a taboo word carrying frissons of hysterical phobia.
I would fear science in general if properly understood.
My god is a little god , and I want him to stay that way. '  A religion , old or new , that stressed the magnificence of the universe as revealed by modern science might be able to draw forth reserves of reverence and awe hardly tapped by the conventional faiths. " 
The religious lobby in this country is massively financed by foundations -- to say nothing of all the tax benefits -- by foundations such as the Templeton Foundation and the Discovery Institute.
Well , here ' s how it changed me.
Forget about the hybrid auto -- Shai Agassi says it ' s electric cars or bust if we want to impact emissions . His company , Better Place , has a radical plan to take entire countries oil-free by 2020.
So how would you run a whole country without oil ? 
The original thought I had : this must be ethanol.
And then sort of through a process of wandering around , I got to the thought that actually if you could convert an entire country to electric cars , in a way that is convenient and affordable , you could get to a solution.
So one , it has to be more convenient than a car.
And convenient is not something that you drive for an hour and charge for eight.
How do you do it from the power of the consumer up ? 
Now if you separate between the two , you could actually answer the need for a convenient car by creating a network , by creating a network before the cars show up.
And so the first thought that came to mind is , everywhere we park we have electric power.
The second step of the infrastructure needs to take care of the range extension.
So what we added is a second element to our network , which is a battery swap system.
It looks like a car wash . You come into your car wash.
We said that if you stop to swap your battery more than 50 times a year we start paying you money because it ' s an inconvenience.
Everybody tells us batteries are so expensive.
Remember in your car you have a gas tank.
We have a battery bay . It costs the same hundred dollars as the gas tank.
And so it ' s sort of a mini well.
You , today , buy gasoline miles.
Those of you who have a hard time calculating what that means -- in the average consumer environment we ' re in in the U.S.
But e-miles follow Moore ' s Law.
We do not use any electrons that come from coal.
That is an 80 cent gallon.
That ' s how I solved it in my head . It was a white paper I handed out to governments.
Peres thought that was a great idea.
But one of them Carlos Ghosn , CEO of Renault and Nissan , when asked about hybrids said something very fascinating.
And actually true to form , Renault has put a billion and a half dollars in building nine different types of cars that fit this kind of model that will come into the market in mass volume -- mass volume being the first year , 100 thousand cars.
And I had to quit and come and do this thing called A Better Place.
It ' s inversely proportional to taxes.
If you fail the IQ test they ask you to leave the country.
If you ' re thinking about it in terms of islands , we decided to go to the biggest island that we could find , and that was Australia . The third country we announced was Australia.
and pick the two best places -- the one where you didn ' t need any range extension.
He decided that he ' s going to take over the state , unofficially , and then officially , and then created this beautiful Region One policy.
Why is this a big issue ? 
The foundation of this curve is that we keep losing the wells that are close to the ground.
Here is the problem : at 147 dollars a barrel , which we were in six months ago , the U.S . spent a ton of money to get oil.
We ' re going to revive the economy . Hopefully it happens between now and 2015 , somewhere in that space.
That is another 25 million barrels a day.
We take our money and we give it away.
And that ' s the difference between problems that are additive , like CO2 , which we go slowly up and then we tip , and problems that are depletive , in which we lose what we have , which oscillate , and they oscillate until we lose everything we ' ve got.
That is oh point oh well percent of the rest of the world.
That is the most pessimistic number you can have.
That ' s an enormous amount of cars.
They ' ll be the first in line to get off because their prices are high.
We ' re the only ones who don ' t have the price set right.
Very interesting . The car industry has been focused just on themselves.
All this stuff that happens around.
Some of it will go back to your own pocket.
In Israel , we ' ve asked to put a solar farm in the south of Israel.
We said ,  " No no , but what if we prove it ?  " 
Think of it as a project that spans over about 10 years.
The two numbers are zero -- as in zero footprint or zero oil -- and scale it infinity.
And actually 700 and change million cars today emit 2.8 billion tons of CO2.
I actually shared that with some legislators here in the U.S.
And there will be about a 20 percent chance we ' ll recover him.
came from a source of energy that was immoral : human slaves.
Let ' s not do it immediately . Maybe we free the kids and keep the slaves.
We have to make it immediately.
http://www.ted.com/talks/ngozi_okonjo_iweala_on_doing_business_in_africa.html
Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala : Want to help Africa ?  Do business here
What I want to do this morning is share with you a couple of stories and talk about a different Africa.
This is the Africa that is changing , that Chris alluded to.
And I want to start by telling you a story about that change in Africa.
Alamieyeseigha was arraigned in London.
This is a story about the fact that people want their resources managed properly for their good , and not taken out to places where they ' ll benefit just a few of the elite.
And that successes are being chalked up on this very important fight.
The results are showing : independent monitoring by the World Bank and other organizations show that in many instances the trend is downwards in terms of corruption , and governance is improving.
All the time when they talk about it you immediately think about Africa.
I ' m working on an initiative now , along with the World Bank , on asset recovery , trying to do what we can to get the monies that have been taken abroad -- developing countries '  moneys -- to get that sent back.
We are grateful , but we know that we can take charge of our own destinies if we have the will to reform.
And this is what we started to do in one of the largest countries on the continent , Nigeria.
What we started to do was to realize that we had to take charge and reform ourselves.
We put together a program that would , one : get the state out of businesses it had nothing -- it had no business being in.
Can you believe that prior to this reform -- which started at the end of 2003 , when I left Washington to go and take up the post of Finance Minister -- we had a telecommunications company that was only able to develop 4,500 landlines in its entire 30-year history ? 
When President Obasanjo supported and launched the liberalization of the telecommunications sector , we went from 4,500 landlines to 32 million GSM lines , and counting.
360 million in a market -- in a country that is a poor country , with an average per capita income just under 500 dollars per capita.
But there ' s a huge market out there , and people don ' t know about it , or they don ' t want to know.
And Nigeria , with the oil sector , had the reputation of being corrupt and not managing its own public finances well.
We didn ' t know we could pull it off ; it was very controversial.
That smoothened out . We were able to save , just before I left , 27 billion dollars . Whereas -- and this went to our reserves -- when I arrived in 2003 , we had seven billion dollars in reserves.
We brought inflation down from 28 percent to about 11 percent.
Agriculture grew at better than eight percent.
We have opportunities in housing and real estate.
So , huge things in construction , real estate , mortgage markets . Financial services : we had 89 banks . Too many not doing their real business.
Barclays Bank of the U.K . is bringing in 500 million.
So in financial services , a great deal of opportunity.
So what am I trying to say ?  I ' m trying to tell you that there ' s a new wave on the continent.
This is better than the performance of many OECD countries.
But you should know that this continent is not -- is a continent of many countries , not one country.
And the best way to do that is by helping create jobs.
And I want to say that some of the best people to invest in on the continent are the women.
And this is a video that has actually won an award as the best documentary of the year.
Mixing African materials , such as we have , with materials from elsewhere.
And the women are diligent . They are focused ; they work hard.
But I ' m standing here saying that those who miss the boat now , will miss it forever.
When you go to Tanzania , listen carefully , because I ' m sure you will hear of the various openings that there will be for you to get involved in something that will do good for the continent , for the people and for yourselves.

In 1835 , James Gordon Bennett founded the first mass-circulation newspaper in New York City.
That ' s the critical change that is being inverted by the Net.
It ' s just been industrial , which means those who were producing had to have a way of raising money to pay those two and a half million dollars , and later , more for the telegraph , and the radio transmitter , and the television , and eventually the mainframe.
All of this completely ignores the fact that throughout this period , there ' s another supercomputer running in the world -- SETI@home.
And computation , storage and communications capacity are in the hands of practically every connected person -- and these are the basic physical capital means necessary for producing information , knowledge and culture , in the hands of something like 600 million to a billion people around the planet.
What ' s the effect of this ?  So , the story that most people know is the story of free or open source software.
The other was Microsoft.
Software has done this in a way that ' s been very visible , because it ' s measurable . But the thing to see is that this actually happens throughout the Web.
This is what you ' ll find out about Barbie . This is it , there ' s nothing more to the definition , including ,  " manufacturers "  -- plural --  " now more commonly produce ethnically diverse dolls , like this black Barbie. "  Which is vastly better than what you ' ll find in the encyclopedia.com , which is Barbie , Klaus.
This is not only outside of businesses . When you think of what is the critical innovation of Google , the critical innovation is outsourcing the one most important thing -- the decision about what ' s relevant -- to the community of the Web as a whole , doing whatever they want to do : so , page rank.
But remember , the computers were also physical . Just physical materials -- our PCs -- we share them together . We also see this in wireless.
If in 1999 I told you , let ' s build a data storage and retrieval system.
Right ?  We always think of it as stealing music , but fundamentally , it ' s a distributed data storage and retrieval system , where people , for very obvious reasons , are willing to share their bandwidth and their storage to create something.
It was too expensive to have decentralized social production , to have decentralized action in society . That was not about society itself.
It ' s that it ' s the first time that it ' s having major economic impact.
But it ' s not the only one.
It also requires certain new organizational approaches.
Now , take the same problem , chunk it into little modules , and motivations become trivial.
So , a new social phenomenon is emerging.
As you see a new set of social relations and behaviors emerging , you have new opportunities . Some of them are toolmakers.
And you see surfers , people who see this happening , and in some sense build it into a supply chain , which is a very curious one . Right ? 
That ' s what IBM does in software services , and they ' ve done reasonably well.
But -- and this is the dark lining -- it is threatened by -- in the same way that it threatens -- the incumbent industrial systems.
http://www.ted.com/talks/seth_berkley_hiv_and_flu_the_vaccine_strategy.html
Seth Berkley : HIV and flu -- the vaccine strategy
But what really threatens humanity ? 
But he placed the likelihood of one such event above all others at close to 100 percent , and that is a severe flu pandemic.
You know , the problem is if this virus occasionally mutates so dramatically , it essentially is a new virus and then we get a pandemic.
Well , we seem to have dodged the deadly pandemic this year that most of us feared , but this threat could reappear at any time.
But with new or better vaccines for malaria , TB , HIV , pneumonia , diarrhea , flu , we could end suffering that has been on the Earth since the beginning of time.
Now , some of us are old enough to have a small , circular scar on our arms from an inoculation we received as children.
Now , it ' s interesting because there are 30-odd diseases that can be treated with vaccines now , but we ' re still threatened by things like HIV and flu.
We knew they worked through old-fashioned trial and error.
They basically create a cache of weapons for your immune system which you can deploy when needed.
Now , let ' s take a look at a video that we ' re debuting at TED , for the first time , on how an effective HIV vaccine might work.
Dendritic cells , or macrophages , capture the virus and display pieces of it.
The virus is defeated.
The antibodies you just saw in this video , in action , are the ones that make most vaccines work.
In this rendering of the flu virus , these different colored spikes are what it uses to infect you.
It ' s also why in the spring , we have to make a best guess at which three strains are going to prevail the next year , put those into a single vaccine and rush those into production for the fall.
Now luckily , that particular virus , although very scary at the time , did not transmit from person to person very easily.
Now let ' s take a look at HIV.
Here ' s a slide looking at the genetic variation of flu and comparing that to HIV , a much wilder target.
Now , in the 27 years since HIV was identified as the cause of AIDS , we ' ve developed more drugs to treat HIV than all other viruses put together.
Many thought that it was just impossible to make an AIDS vaccine , but today , evidence tells us otherwise.
But in the past few months , researchers have also isolated several new broadly neutralizing antibodies from the blood of an HIV infected individual.
In addition , these researchers found a new site on HIV where the antibodies can grab onto , and what ' s so special about this spot is that it changes very little as the virus mutates.
This strategy , working backwards from an antibody to create a vaccine candidate , has never been done before in vaccine research.
We know that they have to latch onto a specific part , so if we can figure out the precise structure of that part , present that through a vaccine , what we hope is we can prompt your immune system to make these matching antibodies.
But , you know , the research that has occurred from HIV now has really helped with innovation with other diseases.
Now , retro-vaccinology is just one technique within the ambit of so-called rational vaccine design.
These are largely hidden from the immune system.
So if this works in humans , what we ' re talking about is a universal flu vaccine , one that doesn ' t need to change every year and would remove the threat of death.
So I want you to think back a few months ago.
Hundreds of millions of dollars were spent and flowed to accelerating vaccine manufacturing.
Viruses only grow in living things , and so it turned out that , for flu , chicken eggs worked really well.
chicken eggs , hundreds of millions of chicken eggs.
So , here ' s an alarming thought.
So right now , the world can produce about 350 million doses of flu vaccine for the three strains , and we can up that to about 1.2 billion doses if we want to target a single variant like swine flu.
Well , with the new technologies emerging now , I hope we can say definitively ,  " Yes. " 
If you lop this off and attach it to the tail of a different bacterium , which creates a vigorous immune response , they ' ve created a very powerful flu fighter.
And , aside from the radically increased production and huge cost savings -- for example , the E . coli method I just talked about -- look at the time saved : this would be lives saved.
Now think of where this leads us.
Luckily , this year ' s flu was relatively mild.
No longer does AIDS need to kill two million a year.
Chris Anderson : Thank you.
And with these types of antibodies , we know humans can make them.
SB : You know , everybody says it ' s 10 years , but it ' s been 10 years every 10 years.
They look good . The problem has been that , what we did is we invested in traditional technologies because that ' s what we were comfortable with.
SB : No , malaria , there is a candidate that actually showed efficacy in an earlier trial and is currently in phase three trials now.
The world needs people like you . Thank you.

And it may be that passing the 50 percent urban point is an economic tipping point . So the world now is a map of connectivity.
So what ' s really going on ?  Well , villages of the world are emptying out.
They ' re people getting out of poverty as fast as they can.
They are constantly upgrading , and in a few cases , the government helps.
There ' s no unemployment in squatter cities . Everyone works.
That ' s the news from downtown . Here it is in perspective.
Ghanaian economist George Ayittey unleashes a torrent of controlled anger toward corrupt leaders in Africa -- and calls on the “Cheetah generation” to take back the continent.
Well , first of all , let me thank Emeka -- as a matter of fact , TED Global -- for putting this conference together.
Even before they do that they will ask for foreign aid.
They understand what accountability and democracy is.
The Hippo Generation are the ruling elites.
Now , there are a lot of Africans who are very angry , angry at the condition of Africa.
That ' s what makes a lot of Africans very angry.
Now , we ' re not saying don ' t help Africa.
There are certain things that we need to recognize.
That ' s what the World Bank says.
What are the leakages ? 
Put that aside.
That ' s far more than the 50 billion Tony Blair wants to raise for Africa.
You know it , I know it , but let ' s not waste our time talking about these mistakes because we ' ll spend all day here.
Now , the previous speaker before me , Idris Mohammed , indicated that we ' ve had abysmal leadership in Africa.
I asked them to name me just 20.
My point is , they couldn ' t go beyond 15.
Now , this leadership is a far cry from the traditional leaders that Africans have known for centuries.
In fact , what we call our governments are vampire states.
The richest people in Africa are heads-of-state and ministers , and quite often the chief bandit is the head-of-state himself.
By raking it off the backs of their suffering people.
An African economy can be broken up into three sectors.
In many African countries the modern sector is lost.
Now the modern sector , of course , is where a lot of the development aid and resources went into.
But that ' s not what we did.
And you can ' t develop the informal and the traditional sectors without an operational understanding of how these two sectors work.
If you look into their traditional systems , Africans organize their states in two types.
In Ashanti tradition , for example , the chief cannot make any decision without the concurrence of the council of elders.
Now , this is what I have described to you.
In the economic system in traditional Africa , the means of production is privately owned.
The accent is on the  " I. " 
They own farms . They decide what to do , what to produce.
When they make a profit it is theirs to keep , not for the chief to sequester it from them.
Kano , Salaga -- they were all there.
What Africans practiced was a different form of capitalism , but then after independence , all of a sudden , markets , capitalism became a western institution , and the leaders said Africans were ready for socialism.
That is not the kind of system Africans had known for centuries.
And I ' d like to show you a quick little video about the informal sector , about the boat-building that I , myself , tried to mobilize Africans in the Diaspora to invest in.
This is by a local Ghanaian entrepreneur , using his own capital.
It also means that he will be able to generate wealth.
There is also traditional medicine.
This is where we need to mobilize Africans , in the Diaspora especially , to invest in this.

Al Gore on averting climate crisis
Put yourselves in my position!
It ' s a true story -- every bit of this is true.
You ' ve heard of phantom limb pain ? 
Low-cost family restaurant chain , for those of you who don ' t know it.
And the man said ,  " He ' s come down a long way , hasn ' t he ?  " 
I told it pretty much the same way I ' ve just shared it with you : Tipper and I were driving ourselves , Shoney ' s , low-cost family restaurant chain , what the man said -- they laughed.
And he was waving a piece of paper , and he was yelling ,  " Call Washington! Call Washington! " 
And it had already been printed in cities all across the United States of America -- it was printed in Monterey , I checked . And the story began ,  " Former Vice President Al Gore announced in Nigeria yesterday ,  ' My wife Tipper and I have opened a low-cost family restaurant , named Shoney ' s , and we are running it ourselves. '  "  Before I could get back to U.S . soil , David Letterman and Jay Leno had already started in on -- one of them had me in a big white chef ' s hat , Tipper was saying ,  " One more burger , with fries! " 
But I was thinking that since I plan to make a lifelong habit of coming back to TED , that maybe I could talk about that another time.
Now , the slide show . I update the slide show every time I give it.
This is just for the United States of America . Historical average for January is 31 degrees . Last month was 39.5 degrees.
It ' s not negative ; it ' s positive . These are investments that pay for themselves.
Cars and trucks are very significant , and we have the lowest standards in the world , and so we should address that . But it ' s part of the puzzle.
Not quite there yet.
I mentioned automobiles -- buy a hybrid . Use light rail.
Those of you who are good at branding , I ' d love to get your advice and help on how to say this in a way that connects with the most people.
There is a carbon calculator . Participant Productions convened , with my active involvement , the leading software writers in the world on this arcane science of carbon calculation to construct a consumer-friendly carbon calculator.
Invest sustainably . Majora mentioned this.
Become a catalyst of change . Teach others ; learn about it ; talk about it.
And I am personally going to train people to give this slideshow , re-purposed , with some of the personal stories obviously replaced with a generic approach , and -- it ' s not just the slides , it ' s what they mean . And it ' s how they link together.
It doesn ' t mean that if you are a Republican that I ' m trying to convince you to be a Democrat . We need Republicans as well . This used to be a bipartisan issue , and I know that in this group it really is . Become politically active.
Once it ' s a closed system , you will have legal liability if you do not urge your CEO to get the maximum income from reducing and trading the carbon emissions that can be avoided . The market will work to solve this problem if we can accomplish this.
It ' s now repetition of short , hot-button , 30-second , 28-second television ads.
Somebody said the test we ' re facing now , a scientist told me , is whether the combination of an opposable thumb and a neocortex is a viable combination.
This is an opportunity . Not just this , but connected to the ideas that are here , to bring more coherence to them.
The Gulf oil spill dwarfs comprehension , but we know this much : it ' s bad . Carl Safina scrapes out the facts in this blood-boiling cross-examination , arguing that the consequences will stretch far beyond the Gulf -- and many so-called solutions are making the situation worse.
This is the ocean as I used to know it.
I ' m basically just a guy that likes to go fishing ever since I was a little kid , and because I did , I wound up studying sea birds to try to stay in the coastal habitats that I so loved.
And the same thing with the atmosphere : If you took all the atmosphere and rolled it up in a ball , you would get that little sphere of gas on the right.
We ' re warming the climate.
If you take a sea urchin larva from 8.1 , put it in a pH of 7.7 -- not a huge change -- it becomes deformed and dies.
Now , let ' s take a little tour around the Gulf a little bit.
When the water goes down , they know what to do.
They can ' t go and work in the local hotel business because there isn ' t one in their community.
If you go to the site of the blowout , it looks pretty unbelievable.
You go in along the shore , you can find it everywhere.
They ' re not allowed to put more than 10 pounds of sand in a 50-gallon plastic bag.
They don ' t see the little , tiny sign that says :  " Stay out of the water. " 
You see people who are really shell-shocked.
They ' re finding that their world is really collapsing.
What ' s going on underwater ? 
But I couldn ' t take a submarine ride -- especially between the time I knew I was coming here and today -- so I had to do a little experiment myself to see if there was oil in the Gulf of Mexico.
And you add a little energy from the wind and the waves , and you get a big mess , a big mess that you can ' t possibly clean , you can ' t touch , you can ' t extract and , I think most importantly -- this is what I think -- you can ' t see it.
Personally , I think that the dispersants are a major strategy to hide the body , because we put the murderer in charge of the crime scene.
So do sea turtles.
I heard the most incredible story today when I was on the train coming here.
He has no bookings left.
And he moved away because it was his last fishing trip , and he knew that the dolphins scare fish.
Now , in the Exxon Valdez spill , about 30 percent of the killer whales died in the first few months.
And some things , I think , will probably come back a little faster.
They get in the Gulf Stream . They go all the way to Europe.
They don ' t usually like to go into water that is very cloudy anyway.
If it ' s not , it ' s certainly affecting their eggs and larvae , I would certainly think.
We ' re starting with something that ' s had a lot of stresses and a lot of problems to begin with.
They were all on the Gulf in May , while oil was starting to come ashore in certain places.
I saw birds that breed in Greenland in the Gulf , so this is a hemispheric issue.
Even when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor , at least they shot back.
The booms are absolutely not made for open water.
And I think , you know , that ' s a great name for boats that think that they ' re going to do anything to make a dent in this by dragging a boom between them when there are literally hundreds of thousands of square miles in the Gulf right now with oil at the surface.
Here are shrimp boats employed.
All they ' re doing is stirring it.
And that lower photo , that ' s a bird colony that has been boomed.
In fact , really what I think they should do , if anything -- they ' re trying so hard to protect those nests -- actually , if they destroyed every single nest some of the birds would leave , and that would be better for them this year.
It ' s really important to get those images and to show it.
I think that this is the result of gross negligence.
It turns out that -- you see this sign on almost every commercial vessel in the United States -- you know , if you spilled a couple of gallons of oil , you would be in big trouble.
It would not take an awful lot to anticipate that after making 30,000 holes in the sea floor of the Gulf of Mexico looking for oil , oil might start coming out of one of them.
It really started from the destruction of the idea that the government is there because it ' s our government , meant to protect the larger public interest.
But in the entire rest of government right now and for the last at least 30 years , there has been a culture of deregulation that is caused directly by the people who we need to be protected from , buying the government out from under us.
That ' s what it would really mean to be conservative.
The Glass-Steagall Act -- which was really to protect us from the kind of thing that caused the recession to happen , and the bank meltdown and all that stuff that required the bailouts -- that was put in effect in 1933 , was systematically destroyed.
We ' re either going to have an absolutely unmitigated catastrophe of this oil leak in the Gulf , or we will make the moment we need out of this , as many people have noted today.
The first offshore drills were called harpoons.
We ' re still lighting something on fire every time we want energy.
We ' ve been here before with energy , and people saying the economy cannot withstand a switch , because the cheapest energy was slavery.

Eli Pariser : Beware online  " filter bubbles " 
And I want to talk about what a Web based on that idea of relevance might look like.
And I was sure that it was going to be great for democracy and for our society.
I ' m progressive , politically -- big surprise -- but I ' ve always gone out of my way to meet conservatives.
And without consulting me about it , it had edited them out.
If I search for something , and you search for something , even right now at the very same time , we may get very different search results.
You can ' t see how different your search results are from anyone else ' s.
When you put them side-by-side , you don ' t even have to read the links to see how different these two pages are.
And this was the big story of the day at that time.
There are a whole host of companies that are doing this kind of personalization.
As Eric Schmidt said ,  " It will be very hard for people to watch or consume something that has not in some sense been tailored for them. " 
And what ' s in your filter bubble depends on who you are , and it depends on what you do.
And they were looking at the Netflix queues , and they noticed something kind of funny that a lot of us probably have noticed , which is there are some movies that just sort of zip right up and out to our houses.
You know we all want to be someone who has watched  " Rashomon, "  but right now we want to watch  " Ace Ventura "  for the fourth time.
And the challenge with these kinds of algorithmic filters , these personalized filters , is that , because they ' re mainly looking at what you click on first , it can throw off that balance.
And along came the Internet and it swept them out of the way , and it allowed all of us to connect together , and it was awesome.
So if algorithms are going to curate the world for us , if they ' re going to decide what we get to see and what we don ' t get to see , then we need to make sure that they ' re not just keyed to relevance.
Then people noticed that they were doing something really important.
And we need the new gatekeepers to encode that kind of responsibility into the code that they ' re writing.
And we need you to give us some control so that we can decide what gets through and what doesn ' t.
And it ' s not going to do that if it leaves us all isolated in a Web of one.

Your sequence and mine are slightly different.
The headlines tell us that genes can give us scary diseases , maybe even shape our personality , or give us mental disorders.
Are you more than your genes ? 
I think we should say it all together.
I am my connectome.
SS : That sounded great.
Its modest nervous system consists of just 300 neurons.
Your connectome is far more complex than this because your brain contains 100 billion neurons and 10,000 times as many connections.
What ' s in that information ? 
And so now you can see why I proposed this hypothesis : I am my connectome.
And to find the connectomes of brains more like our own , we need more sophisticated technologies , that are automated , that will speed up the process of finding connectomes.
They extend long and delicate branches , and in short , they look like trees.
Bobby is holding fantastically thin slices of a mouse brain.
And still , you may not see the branches.
And we can do that for another neuron in green.
They contain a molecule know as a neurotransmitter.
How can we find an entire connectome ? 
Now , at this point , you ' ve learned the basics of neurons and synapses.
You guys are laughing , but you know , this book changed my life.
Or maybe really , really fine capellini with branches.
And so let ' s do a series of comparisons to show you.
And a neuron , well , that ' s smaller than brain.
Because if you look at a brain with your naked eye , you don ' t really see how complex it is , but when you use a microscope , finally the hidden complexity is revealed.
I feel curiosity , and I feel wonder , but at times I have also felt despair.
And yet , I persist in this quixotic endeavor.
I do not know , but I hope that I will live to see that day , because finding an entire human connectome is one of the greatest technological challenges of all time.
For now , let me try to convince you of the plausibility of this hypothesis , that it ' s actually worth taking seriously.
Well , neurons , like trees , can grow new branches , and they can lose old ones.
Well , it ' s true.
And there ' s a lot of evidence that neural activity is encoding our thoughts , feelings and perceptions , our mental experiences.
The connectome is where nature meets nurture.
What else is in this picture ? 
Neural activity is constantly changing.
And as I told you just now , neural activity can change the connectome.
So let ' s return from the heights of metaphor and return to science.
Let us attempt to read out memories from connectomes.
And this sequence of neural activation is hypothesized to be the neural basis of those sequence of movements.
So we ' ll have to use our computers to try to unscramble the chain.
I hope not.
I ' ll give you a hint . It ' s a big number.
These are plausible claims , but in truth , we can ' t see the brain ' s wiring clearly enough to tell if these are really true.
If you believe that I am my connectome , I think you must also accept the idea that death is the destruction of your connectome.
Should we ridicule the modern seekers of immortality , calling them fools ? 
We know that damage to the brain occurs after death and during freezing.
On the other hand , if the connectome is still intact , we cannot ridicule the claims of cryonics so easily.
We have used our brains to fashion ever more amazing technologies.

Zach Kaplan and Keith Schacht demo toys from the future
It comes from a company in Japan called GelTech . Now go ahead and open it up.
We spent a long time thinking about why this is , and it ' s just recently that we realized : it ' s when we see something unexpected , it changes our understanding of the way things work.
So , a first idea is to use it on cabinet doors.
For me , I really love this idea.
ZK : It was like six months ago that Keith and I were out in L.A. , and we were at Starbucks having coffee with Roman Coppola.
These things just get him really excited . And so we ' re looking at these concepts , and we were just like , whoa , this guy ' s good.
Narrator : Do you have a need for speed ? 
So I just wanted to let you know , it ' s not actually coming out , just the concept is.
The gel that you ' re holding would be lining the bottom of the board.
So this would actually repel the rider a little bit as you ' re going down.
And I ' m going to kick it to Keith to explain why that ' s important from a technical standpoint.
Now , I ' m not going to get into the physics of it , but all you need to know is that the faster the magnet ' s falling , the greater the stopping force.
They can be made to automatically roll up , or they can be made stable , like Zach ' s , to hold any position in between.
So we decided to go out onto the streets of Chicago and ask a few people on the streets what they thought you could do with this.
Woman : An olive server.
You sir , come on up.
We need you to stand right in front of the TED sign.
ZK : I ' d just like to let you all know that this presentation has been brought to you by Target.
So , describe to the audience the temperature of your shirt . Go ahead.
It ' s so safe you could drink this stuff.
SJ : Excellent , thank you.
Now , the unexpected thing about this is that Zach could stand up on stage and drench a perfectly innocent member of the audience without any concern that we ' d damage the electronics , that we ' d get him wet , that we ' d hurt the books or the computers . It works because it ' s non-conductive.
Again , it ' s perfectly safe for people . It puts out the fires , doesn ' t hurt anything.
We have a video to show you.
Shape-retaining is common in metal : you bend a piece of aluminum foil , and it holds its place . Contrast that with a plastic garbage can -- and you can push in the sides and it always bounces back.
So , we ' ve prepared a video to show it applied to paper.
ZK : So my favorite idea for this is to apply the ink to a book.
KS : For our last technology , we worked again with Roman and his team at the Directors Bureau to develop a commercial from the future to explain how it works.
OMC : I used to smell like you.
ZK : Now , this technology was developed by these two guys : Professor Ken Suslick and Neil Rakow , of the University of Illinois.
But like in the milk commercial , if you know what odor you want to detect , then they can formulate a specific dye to detect just that odor.
I mean , this is a true story . They ' re using policemen as canaries.
By detecting the odor of particular bacteria , or viruses , or even lung cancer , the dots will change and they can use software to analyze the results.
Because every one of these six changed our understanding of what was possible in the world . Prior to seeing this , we would have assumed : a 10-foot pole couldn ' t fit in your pocket ; something as inexpensive as ink couldn ' t sense the way paper is being bent ; every one of these things -- and we ' re constantly trying to find more.
And he took the thing and he looked up to Steve and he said ,  " Look , hydrophobic string. " 
At the Taste3 conference , chef Dan Barber tells the story of a small farm in Spain that has found a humane way to produce foie gras . Raising his geese in a natural environment , farmer Eduardo Sousa embodies the kind of food production Barber believes in.
I went to Spain a few months ago and I had the best foie gras of my life.
Foie gras and the future of cooking.
It ' s pending here in California , and just recently in New York.
The reasons usually just boil down to the gavage , which is the force feeding.
Suffice to say it ' s like -- it ' s not the prettiest picture of sustainable farming.
It makes everything else you put it with taste incredible.
Not a lot of people are doing it.
Natural foie gras.
So no gavage , no force feeding , no factory-like conditions , no cruelty.
That is until last year , when Eduardo won the Coup de Coeur , the coveted French gastronomic prize.
As he said to me , that really pissed the French off.
 " Spanish chef accused .. .  "  -- and the French accused him.
Huh , amazing.
He doesn ' t look like a guy who ' s paying off French judges for his foie gras.
There ' s no force feeding.
That is , until I went to Eduardo ' s farm in Extremadura , 50 miles north of Seville , right on the Portugal border.
I ' m just here to give the geese what they want.
And when I was speaking to him , you know , I thought , like I ' m speaking to you now , right , but sort of in the middle of my questions , my excited questions , because the more I got to know him and his system , the more exciting this whole idea became.
And finally , by the end of the day I was like , Ed-uar-do , you know like this ? 
So I hushed my voice.
Right up to us , like right up to here.
The electricity on this fiberglass fence is only on the outside.
He doesn ' t.
He felt like they felt manipulated.
The landscape is incredible.
And the irony of ironies is because Extremadura , the area -- what does Extremadura mean ? 
Upgrades the life for these geese.
He lets them take what they want and he says ,  " Usually , it ' s about 50 percent . They ' re very fair. " 
But he never controls it.
You want to look and see what good foie gras is , it ' s got to be bright yellow.
But he found this wild plant called the Lupin bush.
Not for the bush , but for the seeds.
Of the highest quality foie gras yellow I ' ve ever seen.
And I was like , you know , I always get a little , like , weirded out by people who deflect everything away from themselves.
And we ' re sitting there , and I hear [clapping] from a distance , so I look over.
And this squadron of geese come over.
And his geese are calling up now to the wild geese.
No way.
They ' ve come to stay ? 
He said ,  " No , no , no.
They don ' t need anything more. " 
Imagine -- I don ' t know , imagine a hog farm in , like , North Carolina , and a wild pig comes upon a factory farm and decides to stay.
It was incredible.
I ' m really in love with him at this point.
But this was transformative . Really transformative.
And you could taste herbs , you could taste spices.
But I can taste things.
But no.
We went back out for the final tour of the farm , and he showed me the wild pepper plants and the plants that he made sure existed on his farm for salinity.
How come you don ' t give him this ? 
He was right.
And as he said , I think fittingly , it ' s a gift from God , with God saying , you ' ve done good work.
And in the corner of one of these -- one of my notes , is this note that says , when asked , what do you think of conventional foie gras ? 
I ' m on the plane and I ' m just tearing my hair out.
So I did some research when I got back , and here ' s what I found.
By accident.
And they saw in the fall that there was this natural , beautiful , sweet , delicious fat from geese.
The Pharaoh got wind of this and wanted to taste it.
And he demanded that the Jews supply enough for everyone.
Supposedly , anyway . I believe that one.
Most of what we eat today.
It ' s an insult to the basic laws of nature and of biology.
Take more , sell more , waste more.
If human beings disappeared , life on Earth as we know it would flourish. " 
One in which we stop treating the planet as if it were some kind of business in liquidation.
Listening as Janine Benyus , one of my favorite writers and thinkers about this topic says ,  " Listening to nature ' s operating instructions. " 
And it ' s also almost always , and I haven ' t found an example otherwise , but almost always , the most delicious choice.
development,global issues
My brothers and I dug in , and that ' s when my father came home.
My father was responsible for building roads in Bihar , and he had developed a firm stance against corruption , even though he was harassed and threatened.
Only I later realized that what he fed me was food for his entire family for two days.
My initial work focused on Uganda , where I focused on negotiating reforms with the Finance Ministry of Uganda so they could access our loans.
Globally , 1.3 billion people live on less than $1.25 a day , and the work I did in Uganda represents the traditional approach to these problems that has been practiced since 1944 , when winners of World War II , 500 founding fathers , and one lonely founding mother , gathered in New Hampshire , USA , to establish the Bretton Woods institutions , including the World Bank.
Today , each of these elements is opening up due to dramatic changes in the global environment.
They get their inspiration , their hope , their practical know-how , from successful emerging economies in the South.
This is the second shift : open aid.
So this simple mashup reveals that donors have not financed any schools in the areas with the most out-of-school children , provoking new questions . Is development assistance targeting those who most need our help ? 
From the Arab Spring to the Anna Hazare movement in India , using mobile phones and social media not just for political accountability but also for development accountability.
This is a public budget.
Tools like this help turn a shelf full of inscrutable documents into a publicly understandable visual , and what ' s exciting is that with this openness , there are today new opportunities for citizens to give feedback and engage with government.
In Dar es Salaam , Tanzania , even an impoverished community was able to use these tools to voice its aspirations.
But , you know , in many parts of the world , governments are not interested in opening up or in serving the poor , and it is a real challenge for those who want to change the system.
Two years ago , on April 8th , 2010 , I called my father.
These became the two bookends of his life , and the journey he traveled in between mirrored the changing development landscape.
If we do , we will find that the collective voices of the poor will be heard in Bihar , in Uganda , and beyond.
Designer Philippe Starck -- with no pretty slides to show -- spends 18 minutes reaching for the very roots of the question  " Why design ?  "  Listen carefully for one perfect mantra for all of us , genius or not.
You will understand nothing with my type of English.
Now after Carolyn , and all the other guys , I feel like shit.
We can start , if you want , by understanding -- it ' s just to start , it ' s not interesting , but -- how I work.
That doesn ' t interest me.
I call that the cynical design.
I think ,  " What will be the effect of the brush in the mouth ?  " 
What animal species creates this civilization ? 
But to come back , where I am at the animal species , there is things to see.
The big image is our story , our poetry , our romanticism.
Yes , point five , OK , OK , OK! I ' m a designer , that ' s all , of Christmas gifts.
At the end , finally , that succeeds , and life appears.
Can you imagine ?  From that stupid bacteria to us , with a microphone , with a computer , with an iPod : four billion years.
Can you imagine ?  It ' s very symbolic.
That is our poetry . That is our beautiful story.
We have a way to look at Earth like that , you know ,  " I am the man . The final man.
Because that is our intelligence of mutation and things like that.
We can say that.
And you will fall , and you will die . Dangerous.
You , you survive . It ' s OK.
From this level , the more you can raise this angle of view , the more you will be important for the society.
From this to here , that , it ' s genius.
Take care , in this training , to be a good mutant.
That means , when your brain is not enough big , when you don ' t understand , you go ,  " Ah , it ' s God , it ' s God. "  That ' s ridiculous.
It ' s called schizophrenia , and you are dead also.
It ' s very , very , very important.
From far , this line looks very smooth , like that.
And it ' s very important to know where we are.
We can say ,  " It ' s luxurious time. " 
With many , many , many , many face of barbaria.
That means , when barbaria is back , forget the beautiful chairs , forget the beautiful hotel , forget design , even -- I ' m sorry to say -- forget art.
That ' s why today I ' m so ashamed to make this job.
That ' s why I say that . I say that , because , I repeat , nothing exist if it ' s not in the good reason , the reason of our beautiful dream , of this civilization.
We are God now . We are . It ' s almost done.
You go to the future back , back , back , back , like that.
And the beauty of this , in perhaps 50 years , 60 years , we can finish completely this civilization , and offer to our children the possibility to invent a new story , a new poetry , a new romanticism.
The only rule is , we have not to have any idea about the next story.

Patricia Kuhl : The linguistic genius of babies
The modern tools of neuroscience are demonstrating to us that what ' s going on up there is nothing short of rocket science.
What this mother -- and the 800 people who speak Koro in the world -- understands [is] that , to preserve this language , they need to speak it to the babies.
What we see here is that language has a critical period for learning.
After puberty , we fall off the map.
So we ' ve been studying the babies using a technique that we ' re using all over the world and the sounds of all languages.
What have we learned ? 
We can discriminate the sounds of our own language , but not those of foreign languages.
So at six to eight months the babies are totally equivalent.
This is the critical period for sound development , but what ' s going on up there ? 
English Mother : Ah , I love your big blue eyes -- so pretty and nice.
English has a lot of Rs and Ls.
But we as adults are no longer absorbing those statistics.
It ' s raising lots of questions about bilingual people.
We knew that , when monolinguals were tested in Taipei and Seattle on the Mandarin sounds , they showed the same pattern.
What we did was expose American babies during this period to Mandarin.
We had to run a control group to make sure that just coming into the laboratory didn ' t improve your Mandarin skills.
They were as good as the babies in Taiwan who ' d been listening for 10-and-a-half months.
So we ran another group of babies in which the kids got the same dosage , the same 12 sessions , but over a television set and another group of babies who had just audio exposure and looked at a teddy bear on the screen.
The social brain is controlling when the babies are taking their statistics.
But it ' s completely safe , completely non-invasive and silent.
She ' s a six-monther.
It ' s a technical tour de force.
We are embarking on a grand and golden age of knowledge about child ' s brain development.
In investigating the child ' s brain , we ' re going to uncover deep truths about what it means to be human , and in the process , we may be able to help keep our own minds open to learning for our entire lives.

Because everyone was a hero.
From just an idea that sounded crazy , you have the largest encyclopedia in the world.
Everything was going bad.
Yet , nothing was happening.
Everyone was scared.
A dictator cannot live without the force.
Platforms like YouTube , Twitter , Facebook were helping us a lot because it basically gave us the impression that ,  " Wow , I ' m not alone.
There are lots of people who care about their freedom.
But they are still feeling the pain of the Egyptian.
Khaled Saeed was killed in June 2010.
He was tortured , brutally tortured to death.
But people did not relate to this.
He was a middle-class guy.
 " What are we going to do ?  "   " I don ' t know. " 
But of course , they don ' t listen.
In fact , one of the most ridiculous ideas was ,  " Hey , let ' s have a silent stand.
People were making fun of the idea.
They were actually attacking them.
In fact , the anonymous admin job was to collect ideas , help people to vote on them and actually tell them what they are doing.
The leader was everyone on that page.
And when I saw the street on the 25th , I went back and said ,  " Egypt before the 25th is never going to be Egypt after the 25th.
Thank God I announced the locations and everything.
And I did not really hear anything . I did not know anything.
Seriously , with the amount of change I had noticed in this square , I thought it was 12 years.
People were so empowered.
Who would [have] imagined before the 25th , if I tell you that hundreds of thousands of Christians are going to pray and tens of thousands of Muslims are going to protect them , and then hundreds of thousands of Muslims are going to pray and tens of thousands of Christians are going to protect them -- this is amazing.
And that was a personal belief , regardless of what ' s going on , regardless of the details.
We ' re going to win because we don ' t have an agenda.
And that ' s actually what happened . We won.
Actually , I had this taxi driver telling me ,  " Listen , I am breathing freedom.
Thanks a lot.

Some of them are fierce ; some of them are wrathful ; some of them are tender ; some of them are wise.
And I would suggest , it is not only humanity that won ' t survive , but it is all species on the planet , as we ' ve heard today.
And early in the morning , I went into the ward.
I looked into the face of her son sitting next to her , and his face was just riven with grief and confusion.
Tending those 31 dying people were young women from villages around Bangalore.
And it reminded me of something that I had just been present for.
And he walked in , and somebody said something to him , we realized he was deaf , and we looked into the rags , and there was this pair of eyes.
I know those hands and eyes ; they touched me as well.
And my family brought in a woman whose mother had been a slave to take care of me.
So we can ask : What is compassion comprised of ? 
It is that ability to really stand strong and to recognize also that I ' m not separate from this suffering.
That component is that we cannot be attached to outcome.
And when I worked in the prison system , it was so clear to me , this : that many of us in this room , and almost all of the men that I worked with on death row , the seeds of their own compassion had never been watered.
I had that condition , to a certain extent , from my own childhood illness.
And in that paralysis , of course , our capacity for compassion is also paralyzed.
Now we know from neuroscience that compassion has some very extraordinary qualities.
Many of us think that compassion drains us , but I promise you it is something that truly enlivens us.
Hey , we live in a very noxious world.
Why don ' t we train our children in compassion ? 
In Buddhism , we say ,  " it takes a strong back and a soft front. " 
And the archetype of this in Buddhism is Avalokiteshvara , Kuan-Yin.
Women have manifested for thousands of years the strength arising from compassion in an unfiltered , unmediated way in perceiving suffering as it is.
I ' m sorry , you ' ve got to do a little bit of that , Jody.
He said ,  " I ' m out of here. " 
He sees that the dog has this big wound on its leg.
I believe that women and girls today have to partner in a powerful way with men -- with their fathers , with their sons , with their brothers , with the plumbers , the road builders , the caregivers , the doctors , the lawyers , with our president , and with all beings.
A founding member of the Axis of Evil Comedy Tour , standup comic Maz Jobrani riffs on the challenges and conflicts of being Iranian-American --  " like , part of me thinks I should have a nuclear program ; the other part thinks I can ' t be trusted ... " 
I was one of the founding members of the Axis of Evil Comedy Tour.
And then there was me , the Iranian-American of the group.
Part of me thinks I should have a nuclear program , the other part thinks I can ' t be trusted with one.
So anyone who ' s gotten their passport in America will tell you , when you get your passport , it still says what country you were born in.
 " I ' m trying to go places. " 
They all went through , and then the border patrol saw my American passport.
He said ,  " What is your father ' s name ?  " 
His name was Jabbar. " 
 " Your grandfather has a parking violation . It ' s way overdue.
Can you say  ' I will kill you in the name of Allah ?  '  "   " I could say that , but what if I were to say ,  ' Hello . I ' m your doctor ?  '  "  They go ,  " Great . And then you hijack the hospital. " 
I want to rob a bank in a film . I want to rob a bank in a film , but do it with a gun , with a gun , not with a bomb strapped around me , right.
Right.
But the fact is , there ' s good people everywhere.
Now , I happened to be in Times Square that night doing a comedy show.
 " I didn ' t get the memo . What ' s going on ?  " 
 " We just wanted to say we tried. " 
Don ' t be Hassan . Don ' t be Hussein. " 
 " Damn it! Why Jack ?  Why ?  " 
I was in Dubai.
For example , Dubai -- cool place.
I was walking . I heard  " Beep , beep. " 
And what ' s crazy -- there ' s a recession going on , even in Dubai , but you wouldn ' t know by the prices.
 " You want some frozen yogurt ? 
He ' s like ,  " Good stuff , man . Columbian . Top of the line . Top of the line. " 
And when you put your two year-old on a slide in the United States , they put something on the slide to slow the kid down as he comes down the slide.
 " On the third floor , sir . On the third floor. " 
And I ' ve been guilty of stereotyping as well.
And I forgot there ' s obviously successful Indians in Dubai as well.
Because he was standing there in like a cheap suit , thin mustache , staring at me.
He goes ,  " I thought you were my driver. " 
Til then , I ' ll keep telling jokes . I hope you keep laughing.
art,arts,design,entertainment,illusion,magic,music,technology
So I would like to show you something I ' ve been working on.
And I ' m going to use them to tell you a little bit about my favorite subject : deception.
Announcer : Ladies and gentlemen , the creation of life.
I use a lot of tricks , which means that sometimes I have to lie to you.
Girl in Phone : Hey , where are you ? 
Man : It ' s just what I ' ve always wanted.
We deceive to gain advantage and to hide our weaknesses.
Let ' s play a game.
Where is the queen ? 
You deceived yourself.
Compulsive gamblers are experts at self-deception.
Bad experiences are quickly forgotten.
That ' s  " Clair de Lune. " 
Thank you . Thank you very much.

At the time he was looking after the rights of political prisoners in Italian jails.
They sat in silence through their trails , waving occasionally at family and friends.
When I asked my friend why the Red Brigades want to talk to me , he said that the female members of the organization had actually supported my name.
Naturally , I didn ' t know that until the day she was arrested.
So , this is exactly what I did.
My friend , on the other hand , she was a good terrorist because she was very good at following orders.
They were constantly short of cash.
In the 1970s , the turnover of the Red Brigades on a yearly basis was seven million dollars.
Because they had no idea.
It was a psychiatrist . He loved sailing.
So , because I am a trained economist and I think in economic terms , all of the sudden I thought , maybe there is something here.
And as we were eating , I had the distinct feeling that I was back in the city of London , having lunch with a fellow banker or an economist.
In fact , I think many people thought that I was a bit crazy.
And what I discovered is this parallel reality , another international economic system , which runs parallel to our own , which has been created by arms organizations since the end of World War II.
The second one is the privatization of terrorism.
A mix of legal and illegal activities is used.
So , they gain independence from the sponsor , and start funding themselves.
So , every single time that somebody got into a taxi in Belfast without knowing , actually , was funding the IRA.
And together they money-laundered their dirty business through the same channel.
Now , deregulation also brought back rogue economics.
It is at this times in which politics actually loses control of the economy , and the economy becomes a rogue force working against us.
And it actually happened again , with the fall of the Berlin wall.
This is about twice the GDP of the United Kingdom , soon will be more , considering where this country is going.
Now , when I went to look at the figures of the U.S . money supply , the U.S . money supply is the amount of dollars that the Federal Reserve prints every year in order to satisfy the increase in the demand for dollars , which , of course , reflects the growth of the economy.
These were money taken out to fund the growth of the terror , illegal and criminal economy.
It can borrow against the total amount of dollars in circulation in the world.
So , here is the implication of the relationship between the worlds of crime , terror , and illegal economy , and our economy.
Part of the War on Terror was the introduction of the Patriot Act.
What the Patriot Act did was to prohibit U.S . bank , and U.S.-registered foreign banks from doing any businesses with off-shore facilities.
All the bankers said to their clients ,  " Get out of the dollars and go and invest somewhere else. " 
The same thing happened , of course , in the world of crime and terror.
And it was introduced only for the U.S . dollars.
So , why did I tell you this story ? 
And believe me , it ' s going to be scary.
Five years ago , Roz Savage quit her high-powered London job to become an ocean rower . She ' s crossed the Atlantic solo , and just started the third leg of a Pacific solo row , the first for a woman . Why does she do it ?  Hear her reasons , both deeply personal and urgently activist.
Hi , my name is Roz Savage and I row across oceans.
This has given me a very special relationship with the ocean.
So today I ' d like to share with you some of my ocean adventures and tell you a little bit about what they ' ve taught me , and how I think we can maybe take some of those lessons and apply them to this environmental challenge that we face right now.
Well , I don ' t know what you ' re thinking , but I ' m talking about the beards.
I didn ' t look the part.
I was working in an office in London as a management consultant.
So , fast forward a few years.
I wanted to live a life that I could be proud of.
The Atlantic Rowing Race runs from the Canaries to Antigua , it ' s about 3,000 miles , and it turned out to be the hardest thing I had ever done.
And pretty early on , those storms started making their presence known.
Oars are your only means of propulsion.
And then when those gave out , I cannibalized one of the broken oars.
I really struggled psychologically , totally overwhelmed by the scale of the challenge , realizing that , if I carried on moving at two miles an hour , 3,000 miles was going to take me a very , very long time.
It was a bit like finishing a marathon and getting out of solitary confinement and winning an Oscar all rolled into one.
And I really learned then that , the bigger the challenge , the bigger the sense of achievement when you get to the end of it.
So I grow my own beansprouts.
With my eyes shut . Ha-ha.
Worst ever , 13 miles in the wrong direction.
Do I have a chase boat ? 
Well , I leave that one up to you to judge.
I think we tend to do it a little bit of a disservice in our usual maps.
You can just see a little bit of North America up here and a sliver of Australia down there.
So , because nobody in their straight mind would row straight past Hawaii without dropping in , I decided to cut this very big undertaking into three segments.
Boat got a bit dinged up , so did I.
We had a bit of a battle of wills.
So I had to launch a very expensive salvage operation and then wait another nine months before I could get back out onto the ocean again.
But it was not without misadventure.
Fortunately , help was at hand.
Partly , they ' d had a bit of a delay.
They were running out of food ; I was running out of water.
But , eventually , we did manage to meet up and Joel hopped overboard , caught us a beautiful , big mahi-mahi , which was the best food I ' d had in , ooh , at least three months.
It leaches out chemicals into the flesh of the poor critter that ate it , and then we come along and eat that poor critter , and we get some of the toxins accumulating in our bodies as well.
And you ' ll notice something about Tarawa ; it is very low-lying.
And also , as an increase in extreme weather events due to climate change , they ' re expecting more waves to come in over the fringing reef , which will contaminate their fresh water supply.
How , literally , ungrounded that would make me feel.
I think there are probably three key points here.
I found out that people had rowed across oceans.
But what about if we just change that story ? 
But it does . Generally , we haven ' t got ourselves into this mess through big disasters.
And when we do that , we ' re not just one person.
That ' s just one example.
I thought if I had the right house or the right car or the right man in my life , then I could be happy.
I plan on being around for a long time , and when I ' m 90 years old , I want to be happy and healthy.
And the idea here is that all our Eco-Heroes will log at least one green deed every day.
I really believe that we stand at a very important point in history.
http://www.ted.com/talks/eddi_reader_sings_about_what_you_ve_got.html
Eddi Reader on  " What You ' ve Got " 
Singer/songwriter Eddi Reader performs  " Kiteflyer ' s Hill, "  a tender look back at a lost love . With Thomas Dolby on piano.
This is about a place in London called Kiteflyer ' s Hill where I used to go and spend hours going  " When is he coming back ?  When is he coming back ?  " 
It ' s a beautiful song written by a guy called Martin Evan , actually , for me.
Reed Kroloff gives us a new lens for judging new architecture : is it modern , or is it romantic ?  Look for glorious images from two leading practices -- and a blistering critique of the 9/11 planning process.
To be new at TED -- it ' s like being the last high-school virgin.
And you ' re on the inside , and it ' s everything you hoped it would be.
So anyway , today we ' ll talk about architecture a little bit , within the subject of creation and optimism.
But any kind of conversation about architecture -- which is , in fact , what you were just talking about , what was going on here , setting up TED , small-scale architecture -- at the present time can ' t really happen without a conversation about this , the World Trade Center , and what ' s been going on there , what it means to us.
I think that the World Trade Center in , rather an unfortunate way , brought architecture into focus in a way that I don ' t think people had thought of in a long time , and made it a subject for common conversation.
At the point where you can weaponize your buildings , you have to suddenly think about architecture in a very different way.
They ' ve made a selection.
Right . Can we do this again from the top , except use some people with a vague hint of talent , instead of just six utter boobs like we brought in last time , real estate hacks of the kind who usually plan our cities.
This was a scheme by a team called THINK , a New York-based team , and then there was that one , which was the Libeskind scheme.
But I want you to think about these things in terms of a kind of ongoing struggle that American architecture represents , and that these two things talk about very specifically.
So , in the American tradition , the difference between the technocratic and the romantic , would be the difference between Thomas Jefferson ' s Cartesian grids spreading across the United States , that gives us basically the whole shape of every western state in the United States , as a really , truly , technocratic solution , a bowing to the -- in Jefferson ' s time -- current , popular philosophy of rationalism.
It ' s a big deal . It sounds big , it sounds important , it sounds solid . It sounds American . Ballsy , serious , male.
Everyone here must own one , or at least they craved one the moment they saw one.
It ' s in our nature to go ricocheting back and forth between this technocratic solution and a larger , sort of more romantic image of where we are.
And these are two of the top architectural practices in the United States today.
Yeah , it ' s one of those giant camera lenses that takes a picture of the outside world -- it ' s sort of a little movie , without any moving parts -- and projects it on a page , and you can see the world outside you as you walk around it.
What ' s interesting about it is not the shape.
That ' s why we all live in developer houses.
The computer then talks to a machine -- a computer-operated machine , a cad-cam machine -- that can make a zillion different changes , at a moment ' s notice , because the computer is just a machine.
Meanwhile , instead of sending someone working drawings , which are those huge sets of blueprints that you ' ve seen your whole life , what the architect can do is send a set of assembly instructions , like you used to get when you were a child , when you bought little models that said ,  " Bolt A to B , and C to D. " 
You ' re underneath it , looking up into the lens of the camera obscura.
And when you go to the beach , what do you get ?  You get sand dunes.
And those are the pieces of wood . Those are the instructions.
Only one of whom had ever seen the plans before.
It has its own built-in swimming pool , very , very cool.
They were asked to design , replace that bridge in six weeks , building it , including all of the parts , manufactured.
They ' re now building a 16-story building on the side of New York , using the same technology.
Now , let me show you , quickly , the opposite , if I may.
It ' s not to create a technological solution , it ' s to seduce you into something that you can do , into something that will please you , something that will lift your spirits , something that will make you feel as if are in another world -- such as his Nobu restaurant in New York , which is supposed to take you from the clutter of New York City to the simplicity of Japan and the elegance of Japanese tradition.
Every single surface of this restaurant is white.
This is happening by itself.
Let ' s see it one more time.
In the Guardian Tower of New York , converted to a W Union Square -- I ' m sorry I ' m rushing -- where we had to bring in the best horticulturists in the world to make sure that the interior of this dragged the garden space of the court garden of the Union Square into the building itself.
And finally , it ' s about entertainment , as in his headquarters for the Cirque du Soleil , Orlando , Florida , where you ' re asked to enter the Greek theater , look under the tent and join the magic world of Cirque du Soleil.
children,compassion,poetry,spoken word
When I was a kid , I hid my heart under the bed , because my mother said ,  " If you ' re not careful , someday someone ' s going to break it. " 
Stand up for yourself.
And at the same time we were being told what we were , we were being asked ,  " What do you want to be when you grow up ?  " 
When I was a kid , I wanted to be a man.
When I was eight , I wanted to be a marine biologist.
When I was 12 , I wanted to die . When I was 13 , I wanted to kill a kid.
So I said ,  " Professional wrestler. " 
We were being told that we somehow must become what we are not , sacrificing what we are to inherit the masquerade of what we will be.
My dreams are self-conscious and overly apologetic.
But I kept dreaming.
My saying was going to be ,  " I ' m taking out the trash! " 
Poetry.
When I was 19 , I wrote ,  " I will love myself despite the ease with which I lean toward the opposite. " 
And I remember this plan , born out of frustration from a kid who kept calling me  " Yogi, "  then pointed at my tummy and said ,  " Too many picnic baskets. " 
This is who I am.
And because my grandmother thought it was cute , and because they were my favorite , she let me keep doing it.
A few days later , the gym teacher noticed the bruise , and I got sent to the principal ' s office.
I told her , whenever I ' m sad , my grandmother gives me karate chops.
I ' m not the only kid who grew up this way , surrounded by people who used to say that rhyme about sticks and stones , as if broken bones hurt more than the names we got called , and we got called them all.
She was eight years old , our first day of grade three when she got called ugly.
We used to stay inside for recess , because outside was worse.
Kids used to say ,  " She looks like a wrong answer that someone tried to erase , but couldn ' t quite get the job done. " 
He tried to kill himself in grade 10 when a kid who could still go home to Mom and Dad had the audacity to tell him ,  " Get over it. " 
To this day , kids are still being called names.
Every school was a big top circus tent , and the pecking order went from acrobats to lion tamers , from clowns to carnies , all of these miles ahead of who we were.
You built a cast around your broken heart and signed it yourself.
Maybe you used to bring bruises and broken teeth to show-and-tell , but never told , because how can you hold your ground if everyone around you wants to bury you beneath it ? 
We grew up learning to cheer on the underdog because we see ourselves in them.
We are graduating members from the class of We Made It , not the faded echoes of voices crying out ,  " Names will never hurt me. " 
Al Seckel , a cognitive neuroscientist , explores the perceptual illusions that fool our brains . Loads of eye tricks help him prove that not only are we easily fooled , we kind of like it.
We ' re going to talk -- my -- a new lecture , just for TED -- and I ' m going show you some illusions that we ' ve created for TED , and I ' m going to try to relate this to happiness . What I was thinking about with happiness is , what gives happiness -- or happiness , which I equate with joy in my particular area , and I think there ' s something very fundamental . And I was thinking about this . And it ' s in terms of both illusions and movies that we go see and jokes and magic shows is that there ' s something about these things where our expectations are violated in some sort of pleasing way . You go see a movie . And it has an unexpected twist -- something that you didn ' t expect -- and you find a joyful experience . You look at those sort of illusions in my book and it ' s not as what you ' d expect . And there ' s something joyful about it . And it ' s the same thing with jokes and all these sorts of things . So , what I ' m going to try and do in my lecture is go a little bit further and see if I can violate your expectations in a pleasing way . I mean , sometimes expectations that are violated are not pleasant , but I ' m going to try to do it in a pleasant way , in a very primal way , so I can make the audience here happy.
Again , this is not an optical trick . This is what you would see . In other words , it ' s not a camera cut . It ' s a perceptual trick.
If you are a child under the age of 10 who haven ' t been ruined yet , you will look at this image and see dolphins . Now , some of you adults here are saying ,  " What dolphins ?  What dolphins ?  " 
You can violate your expectations about experience . Here is an outside water fountain that I created with some friends of mine , but you can stop the water in drops and -- actually make all the drops levitate . This is something we ' re building for , you know , amusement parks and that kind of stuff.
Right . Now , when -- it ' s interesting that when we look at an image we see , you know , color , depth , texture . And you can look at this whole scene and analyze it . You can see the woman is in closer than the wall and so forth . But the whole thing is actually flat . It ' s painted . It ' s trompe l ' oeil.
And I really say ,  " No. "  I mean , women can navigate through the world just as well as males can -- and why wouldn ' t they ?  However , this is the one illusion that women can consistently do better than males : in matching which head because they rely on fashion cues . They can match the hat.
OK now . Arthur [Ganson] hasn ' t talked yet , but his is going to be a delightful talk and he has some of his really fantastic machines outside . And so , we -- Scott created this wonderful tribute to Arthur Ganson.
And of course , since happiness -- we want  " joy to the world. " 
Ken Knowlton does wonderful composite images , like creating Jacques Cousteau out of seashells -- un-retouched seashells , but just by rearranging them . He did Einstein out of dice because , after all , Einstein said ,  " God does not play dice with the universe. "  Bert Herzog out of un-retouched keyboards . Will Shortz , crossword puzzle . John Cederquist does these wonderful trompe l ' oeil cabinets.
And it ' s interesting , by doing this in this sort of rendered fashion , how much stronger the illusions are . Any case , I hope this has brought you a little joy and happiness , and if you ' re interested in seeing more cool effects , see me outside . I ' d be happy to show you lots of things.

I thought it might be interesting , even for the many long-time collectors here with us at TED , local collectors , to have an outside view of 10 young Indian artists I wish everyone at TED to know.
Bharti seeks to liberate this everyday cliche , as she calls it , by exploding it into something spectacular.
Since Bala himself will be speaking at TED I won ' t spend too much time on him here today , except to say that he really succeeds at making the invisible visible.
Chitra basically remixes and re-titles these iconic images to tease out some of the sexual and gender politics embedded in these deeply influential comics.
He really captures that sense of density and energy which really characterizes modern urban Bombay.
He ' s putting a contemporary spin on the miniature tradition.
She too mines the rich source material of amar chitra kathas , but in a very different way than Chitra Ganesh.
He creates these opulent tableaus inspired by Hieronymus Bosch , but also by the Kashmiri textiles of his youth.
They frequently explore themes of globalization and urbanization , and their home of Delhi is a frequent element in their work.
He celebrates these local and mundane objects globally , and on a grander and grander scale , by incorporating them into ever more colossal sculptures and installations.
And light and shadow are a very important part of her work.
Thank you very much for looking and listening.

So , I hope to convince you that complex doesn ' t always equal complicated.
So here ' s a food web , or a map of feeding links between species that live in Alpine Lakes in the mountains of California.
And lakes with fish have more mosquitoes , even though they eat them.
For example , you could plot the flow of carbon through corporate supply chains in a corporate ecosystem , or the interconnections of habitat patches for endangered species in Yosemite National Park.
So let ' s switch gears and look at a really complex problem courtesy of the U.S . government.
And the stated goal was to increase popular support for the Afghan government.
So let ' s do it . So here we go for the first time ever , a world premiere view of this spaghetti diagram as an ordered network.
Most are non-violent and they fall into two broad categories : active engagement with ethnic rivalries and religious beliefs and fair , transparent economic development and provisioning of services.
Because simple answers may emerge.

Jane McGonigal : The game that can give you 10 extra years of life
Literally , you will live seven and half minutes longer than you would have otherwise , just because you watched this talk.
I ' ll explain it all later , just pay attention to the number at the bottom : plus-7.68245837 minutes that will be my gift to you if I ' m successful in my mission.
Now , because I ' m a game designer , you might be thinking to yourself , I know what she wants us to do with those minutes , she wants us to spend them playing games.
It ' s so much time , in fact , that the number one unsolicited comment that I have heard from people all over the world since I gave that talk , is this : Jane , games are great and all , but on your deathbed , are you really going to wish you spent more time playing Angry Birds ? 
I mean , I want games to be a force for good in the world.
Now , this may surprise you , but it turns out there is actually some scientific research on this question.
Number two : I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends.
Now , as far as I know , no one ever told one of the hospice workers , I wish I ' d spent more time playing video games , but when I hear these top five regrets of the dying , I can ' t help but hear five deep human cravings that games actually help us fulfill.
A recent study from Brigham Young University School of Family life reported that parents who spend more time playing video games with their kids have much stronger real-life relationships with them.
They help us stay connected with people in our social network that we would otherwise grow distant from , if we weren ' t playing games together.
I wish I ' d had the courage to express my true self.
I wish I ' d led a life true to my dreams , and not what others expected of me.
And it ' s true , I ' ve never worked in a hospice , I ' ve never been on my deathbed.
It started two years ago , when I hit my head and got a concussion.
For me that meant no reading , no writing , no video games , no work or email , no running , no alcohol , no caffeine.
My brain started telling me , Jane , you want to die.
Now , why a game ? 
This was an easier way to ask for help.
This was anything I could do on even my worst day to feel just a little bit good , just a little bit productive.
Now it wasn ' t a miracle cure for the headaches or the cognitive symptoms.
I put up some blog posts and videos online , explaining how to play.
And I could tell from their messages and their videos that the game was helping them in the same ways that it helped me.
Now at the time , I ' m thinking to myself , what is going on here ? 
Some people get stronger and happier after a traumatic event.
But scientists now know that a traumatic event doesn ' t doom us to suffer indefinitely.
I understand myself better . I know who I really am now.
It should , because the top five traits of post-traumatic growth are essentially the direct opposite of the top five regrets of the dying.
How do you get from trauma to growth ? 
There are four kinds of strength , or resilience , that contribute to post-traumatic growth , and there are scientifically validated activities that you can do every day to build up these four kinds of resilience , and you don ' t need a trauma to do it.
We ' re going to play a quick game together.
So , everybody ready ?  This is your first quest . Here we go.
Well done , everyone . Now that is worth plus-one physical resilience , which means that your body can withstand more stress and heal itself faster.
Everybody ready for your next quest ? 
Don ' t let the people counting down from 100 interfere with your counting to 50.
We know from the scientific research that willpower actually works like a muscle.
Pick one : Now because of the room we ' re in , fate ' s really determined this for you , but here are the two options.
So , what do we want to see ? 
Okay , one more . Baby elephant.
And here ' s a secret from the scientific literature for you.
All right , pick one , last quest : Shake someone ' s hand for six seconds , or send someone a quick thank you by text , email , Facebook or Twitter . Go!
All right , everybody , that is plus-one social resilience , which means you actually get more strength from your friends , your neighbors , your family , your community.
That means that all of you who just shook hands are biochemically primed to like and want to help each other.
It turns out that people who regularly boost these four types of resilience -- physical , mental , emotional and social -- live 10 years longer than everyone else.
So every single year that you are boosting your four types of resilience , you ' re actually earning .128 more years of life or 46 more days of life , or 67,298 more minutes of life , which means every single day , you are earning 184 minutes of life , or every single hour that you are boosting your four types of resilience , like we just did together , you are earning 7.68245837 more minutes of life.
You still have your special mission , your secret mission.
You can use your first wish to wish for a million more wishes.
Every hour of the day , every day of your life , all the way to your deathbed , which will now be 10 years later than it would have otherwise.
Margaret Wertheim leads a project to re-create the creatures of the coral reefs using a crochet technique invented by a mathematician -- celebrating the amazements of the reef , and deep-diving into the hyperbolic geometry underlying coral creation.
I ' m here today , as June said , to talk about a project that my twin sister and I have been doing for the past three and half years.
It ' s true.
Just to give you an idea of scale , that installation there is about six feet across , and the tallest models are about two or three feet high.
And indeed there are now thousands and thousands of models that people have contributed all over the world as part of this.
Corals are very delicate organisms , and they are devastated by any rise in sea temperatures.
This is our invocation in crochet of a bleached reef.
And they said they were having an exhibition about artists '  response to global warming , and they ' d like our coral reef to be part of it.
And I , naively by this stage , said ,  " Oh , yes , sure. " 
So I had no idea what it meant to fill a 3,000 square-foot gallery.
She thought I ' d gone off my head.
The people in Chicago decided that as well as exhibiting our reefs , what they wanted to do was have the local people there make a reef.
There were hundreds of people involved in that.
So the whole thing has sort of morphed into this organic , ever-evolving creature , that ' s actually gone way beyond Christine and I.
Why not chisel a coral reef out of marble ? 
And the only way that mathematicians know how to model this structure is with crochet . It happens to be a fact.
This sort of geometry revolutionized mathematics when it was first discovered in the 19th century.
But you get too many stitches on the needle . So she quickly realized crochet was the better thing.
So what is this impossible hyperbolic structure ? 
You all have a sense of what a flat space is , Euclidean space is.
And Euclid said ,  " How can I define parallel lines ? 
That ' s our definition of a parallel line.
I have a straight line on my spherical surface.
They ' ve understood there is a generalized concept of straightness , it ' s called a geodesic.
Does someone want to guess ? 
Two answers ?  There may possibly be a third alternative.
There is , there ' s a third alternative.
This nearly drove mathematicians bonkers because , like you , they ' re sitting there feeling bamboozled.
How could they see this ? 
But you don ' t know what a sphere looks like.
And that ' s exactly what happened when Daina Taimina in 1997 , showed that you could crochet models in hyperbolic space.
But look , I can prove to you that they ' re straight because I can take any one of these lines , and I can fold along it.
The discovery of hyperbolic space ushered in the field of mathematics that is called non-Euclidean geometry.
Here ' s two creatures who ' ve never heard of Euclid ' s parallel postulate -- didn ' t know it was impossible to violate , and they ' re simply getting on with it.
They said ,  " Well I guess there aren ' t that many mathematicians sitting around looking at sea slugs. " 
And so in some sense they literally , they had such a symbolic view of mathematics , they couldn ' t actually see what was going on on the lettuce in front of them.
But we found that when we deviated from the specific setness of the mathematical code that underlies it -- the simple algorithm crochet three , increase one -- when we deviated from that and made embellishments to the code , the models immediately started to look more natural.
So this project really has taken on this inner organic life of its own.
But why ?  What ' s at stake here ?  What does it matter ? 
But through this sort of modality , crochet , other plastic forms of play -- people can be engaged with the most abstract , high-powered , theoretical ideas , the kinds of ideas that normally you have to go to university departments to study in higher mathematics , which is where I first learned about hyperbolic space.
He believed that the crystal was the model for all kinds of representation.
We live in a society now where we have lots of think tanks , where great minds go to think about the world.
But what we want to propose , is that the highest levels of abstraction , things like mathematics , computing , logic , etc . -- all of this can be engaged with , not just through purely cerebral algebraic symbolic methods , but by literally , physically playing with ideas.

Here is this mass of jelly , three-pound mass of jelly you can hold in the palm of your hand , and it can contemplate the vastness of interstellar space.
I mean , you have 100 billion nerve cells , little wisps of protoplasm , interacting with each other , and from this activity emerges the whole spectrum of abilities that we call human nature and human consciousness.
What then happens is not an across-the-board reduction in all your mental capacities , a sort of blunting of your cognitive ability.
So let me give you a few striking examples of this.
And if you look , tucked away inside the inner surface of the temporal lobes -- you can ' t see it there -- is a little structure called the fusiform gyrus.
I mean , you know it ' s you because you wink and it winks , and you know it ' s a mirror , but you don ' t really recognize yourself as yourself.
She ' s some other woman pretending to be my mother. " 
When you ' re a little baby , a young baby , you had a strong sexual attraction to your mother.
Thank God , or you would all be sexually aroused when you saw your mother.
It ' s the only interpretation that makes sense to your damaged brain.
Now , you try using the Freudian explanation there.
Normally , visual signals come in , into the eyeballs , go to the visual areas in the brain.
I talked about that earlier.
Or is it something absolutely trivial , like a piece of lint , or a piece of chalk , or a -- I don ' t want to point to that , but -- or a shoe , or something like that ?  OK ? 
You start sweating to dissipate the heat that you ' re going to create from muscular exertion.
So my idea was , when this chap looks at an object , when he looks at his -- any object for that matter , it goes to the visual areas and , however , and it ' s processed in the fusiform gyrus , and you recognize it as a pea plant , or a table , or your mother , for that matter , OK ? 
But because the wire is cut to the emotional centers , he says ,  " But how come , if it ' s my mother , I don ' t experience a warmth ?  " 
It ' s some strange woman pretending to be my mother. " 
And , believe it or not , if I show you a picture of your mother -- I ' m talking about normal people -- you start sweating.
Tables and chairs and lint , nothing happens , as in normal people , but when you show him a picture of his mother , the galvanic skin response is flat.
By the way , if this patient then goes , and mother phones from an adjacent room -- phones him -- and he picks up the phone , and he says ,  " Wow , mom , how are you ?  Where are you ?  " 
The reason is there ' s a separate pathway going from the hearing centers in the brain to the emotional centers , and that ' s not been cut by the accident.
Is it nature , genes , or is it nurture ? 
In fact , you can get a phantom with almost any part of the body.
A subject ripe for scientific enquiry , but we haven ' t pursued that.
These are very compelling , vivid sensations.
The phantom limb -- they ' ll say ,  " But doctor , the phantom limb is paralyzed.
It sounds like an oxymoron.
And this is a serious clinical problem.
Now , why do you get a paralyzed phantom limb ? 
Move . No . Move . No . Move . No.
Now , how do you help these patients ? 
How do you do that ?  Well , virtual reality.
You have a cardboard box with a mirror in the middle , and then you put the phantom -- so my first patient , Derek , came in.
It was a paralyzed phantom arm.
 " Now, "  I said ,  " now , look , wiggle your phantom -- your real fingers , or move your real fingers while looking in the mirror. " 
My first patient came in , and he looked in the mirror , and I said ,  " Look at your reflection of your phantom. " 
Now , I said ,  " Move your normal hand and phantom. " 
And my pain is being relieved. "  OK ? 
 " Oh , nothing . It ' s clenched again. " 
So , I said , OK , this proves my theory about learned paralysis and the critical role of visual input , but I ' m not going to get a Nobel Prize for getting somebody to move his phantom limb.
Maybe , after a period of practice , you can dispense with the mirror , unlearn the paralysis , and start moving your paralyzed arm , and then , relieve yourself of pain. " 
I said ,  " What ?  " 
He said ,  " No , no , no , you know this phantom I ' ve had for the last 10 years ? 
He said ,  " No , last three days , I ' ve not had a phantom arm and therefore no phantom elbow pain , no clenching , no phantom forearm pain , all those pains are gone away.
Now , why does this happen ? 
And your motor command saying there is an arm , and , because of this conflict , the brain says , to hell with it , there is no phantom , there is no arm , right ? 
Now , this technique has been tried on dozens of patients by other groups in Helsinki , so it may prove to be valuable as a treatment for phantom pain , and indeed , people have tried it for stroke rehabilitation.
OK , let me switch gears now to the third part of my talk , which is about another curious phenomenon called synesthesia.
Five is blue , seven is yellow , eight is chartreuse , nine is indigo , OK ? 
Why does this happen ? 
One of the two aspects of this problem are very intriguing.
I ' m going to answer that question.
One theory is they ' re just crazy.
OK . Now , the third theory is that -- well , let ' s ask ourselves what ' s really going on in synesthesia . All right ? 
Now remember -- why does this happen ? 
And that is , there is an abnormal gene , a mutation in the gene that causes this abnormal cross wiring.
And if it ' s between number and color , you get number-color synesthesia.
Well , think about what artists , novelists and poets have in common , the ability to engage in metaphorical thinking , linking seemingly unrelated ideas , such as ,  " It is the east , and Juliet is the Sun. " 
Instantly , you ' ve found the links.
The last demonstration -- can I take one minute ? 
Here , you ' ve got Martian alphabet.
Well , it ' s one or two mutants.
It ' s because you ' re all doing a cross-model synesthetic abstraction , meaning you ' re saying that that sharp inflection -- ki-ki , in your auditory cortex , the hair cells being excited -- Kiki , mimics the visual inflection , sudden inflection of that jagged shape.
The patient says ,  " Well , if it ' s metallic and shiny , it doesn ' t mean it ' s gold.
Something very interesting is going on here in the angular gyrus , because it ' s the crossroads between hearing , vision and touch , and it became enormous in humans . And something very interesting is going on.
http://www.ted.com/talks/martin_rees_asks_is_this_our_final_century.html
Martin Rees asks : Is this our final century ? 
But let ' s start off by remembering that Darwin showed how we ' re the outcome of four billion years of evolution.
If they ' d sent a nuke , it would have been rather more spectacular than what actually happened last Monday.
It landed on the surface . This is pictures taken on the way down.
Each one is like a sun with a retinue of planets orbiting around it.
On a still bigger scale , we see entire galaxies of stars.
Through a small telescope , this would look quite blank , but you see here hundreds of little , faint smudges.
We believe that all of this emerged from a Big Bang -- a hot , dense state . So how did that amorphous Big Bang turn into our complex cosmos ? 
And we compare simulated universes like that -- I ' ll show you a better simulation at the end of my talk -- with what we actually see in the sky.
We know our universes are united though -- links between left and right.
But we ' d like to know the synthesis symbolized at the very top.
And until we have that synthesis , we won ' t be able to understand the very beginning of our universe because when our universe was itself the size of an atom , quantum effects could shake everything.
You can imagine ants on one of them thinking it ' s a two-dimensional universe , not being aware of another population of ants on the other.
Many people suspect that just as we ' ve gone from believing in one solar system to zillions of solar systems , one galaxy to many galaxies , we have to go to many Big Bangs from one Big Bang , perhaps these many Big Bangs displaying an immense variety of properties.
And the most complex things are ourselves , midway between atoms and stars.
We clearly have to be small , compared to stars and planets -- otherwise we ' d be crushed by gravity . And in fact , we are midway.
The science of complexity is probably the greatest challenge of all , greater than that of the very small on the left and the very large on the right.
If I was not a self-effacing Brit , I would mention the book myself , and I would add that it ' s available in paperback.
It may change this century.
Bio- and cybertechnologies are environmentally benign in that they offer marvelous prospects , while , nonetheless , reducing pressure on energy and resources.
And even a tiny probability of catastrophe is unacceptable when the downside could be of global consequence.
He wanted to give up the dangerous kind of science and keep the good bits . Now , that ' s absurdly naive for two reasons.
We have to accept that there will be hazards.
And perhaps the greatest living person is someone I ' m privileged to know , Joe Rothblatt.
And he sets an example of the concerned scientist.
I wrote my book ,  " Our Final Century, "  as a scientist , just a general scientist . But there ' s one respect , I think , in which being a cosmologist offered a special perspective , and that ' s that it offers an awareness of the immense future.
And it ' ll be another six billion before that happens , and any remaining life on Earth is vaporized.
If you represent the Earth ' s lifetime by a single year , say from January when it was made to December , the 21st-century would be a quarter of a second in June -- a tiny fraction of the year.
The plaque reads ,  " Albert Einstein lived here. " 
What would they have seen ? 
The continental landmasses drifted around.
This signaled the start of agriculture.
The planet became an intense emitter of radio waves -- the total output from all TV and cell phones and radar transmissions . And something else happened.
But could they have predicted this unprecedented spike less than halfway through the Earth ' s life ? 
Or will the biosphere stabilize ?

Susan Savage-Rumbaugh : The real-life culture of bonobos
This species lives only in the Congo.
And sexual behavior is not confined to one aspect of their life that they sort of set aside.
And I think perhaps somewhere in our history we sort of , divided our lives up into lots of parts.
There are many people who think that the animal world is hard-wired and that there ' s something very , very special about man.
Well , I don ' t know . There were Tasmanians who were discovered around the 1600s and they had no fire.
He doesn ' t stand quite as upright.
So what I want to do now is introduce you to a species called the Bonobo.
His mother originally came from a forest in Africa.
The Bonobo , although shorter than us and their arms still longer , is more upright , just as we are.
So the -- the bipedal gait is a little easier.
It was a Japanese scientist who first undertook serious field studies of the Bonobo , almost three decades ago.
One discovery was that wild Bonobos often walk bidpedally.
None of the things you will see in this particular video are trained.
Video : Look at all this stuff that ' s here for our campfire.
We need more sticks , too.
I hope I have a lighter.
He ' s learning about how to keep a fire going.
Video : You ' re happy.
SS : Forgot to zip up the back half of his backpack.
This is his sister.
She switches from reverse to forward and she holds onto the wheel , rather than turns it.
It means  " star "  in Swahili.
Very impressive.
He can now cut through tough animal hide.
Kanzi chooses a flake he thinks is sharp enough.
These are the rocks Kanzi used and these are the flakes he made.
She keeps staring out the window.
Video : Then Panbanisha does something unexpected.
What is she writing ? 
They speak when she touches them.
Panbanisha began writing the lexigrams on the forest floor.
The curved line is very similar to the lexigram.
Video : This symbol is not as clear as the others , but one can see Panbanisha is trying to produce a curved line and several straight lines.
The Bonobo ' s abilities have stunned scientists around the world.
Once you have that capacity , the ability to produce language comes rather naturally and rather freely.
Then he peers eagerly into his mother ' s mouth.
She wasn ' t forced to learn the piano ; she saw a researcher play the instrument and took an interest.
Kanzi and Panbanisha are stimulated by this fun-filled environment , which promotes the emergence of these cultural capabilities.
Now you can chase them again . Time to chase them.
Oh no!
We ' re learning how to become like them.
Because we believe that it ' s not biology ; it ' s culture.
business,community,money,philanthropy,psychology,shopping
And a lot of us resonate with this phrase.
So that ' s wrong , and , in fact , if you think that , you ' re actually just not spending it right.
So CNN , a little while ago , wrote this interesting article on what happens to people when they win the lottery.
And it ruins their social relationships , in fact.
and fantasizing about what they ' d do.
This is even worse now :  " Then I ' d have a picture taken and dozens of glossies made.
It also , money often makes us feel very selfish and we do things only for ourselves.
And we thought , let ' s make people do it and see what happens.
They said ,  " Yes. " 
Other people , in the morning , got a slip of paper that said ,  " By 5:00 pm today , spend this money on somebody else. " 
Some people got this slip of paper and 20 dollars.
What did they spend it on ? 
Huge effect here of Starbucks.
What did we find when we called them back at the end of the day ? 
And the other thing we saw is the amount of money doesn ' t matter that much.
We see this again and again when we give people money to spend on other people instead of on themselves.
So we went , in fact , to Uganda and ran a very similar experiment.
And then we asked them how happy they are again.
They basically went out on a date , and he says at the end that he didn ' t  " achieve "  her up till now.
We went to a movie , we left early , and then went back to her room for .. .  "  only cake -- just a piece of cake.
So look at these two.
I drove to the mall in my car , bought a present , gave it to my mom. " 
 " I was walking and met a long-time friend whose son was sick with malaria.
But enormously different motivations here.
So you don ' t have to do amazing things with your money to make yourself happy.
We got data from the Gallup Organization , which you know from all the political polls that have been happening lately.
Are they positively correlated ?  Giving money makes you happy.
So in almost every country in the world where we have this data , people who give money to charity are happier people that people who don ' t give money to charity.
Just below that to the right is Rwanda though , which is amazingly green.
So these are sales teams in Belgium.
But other teams we say ,  " Here ' s 15 euro.
The reason I have a ridiculous pinata there is one of the teams pooled their money and bought a pinata , and they all got around and smashed the pinata and all the candy fell out and things like that.
You don ' t get any money from that.
And basically that if he doesn ' t show me that it works here , I don ' t believe anything he said.
And we did the exact same thing as before.
The teams that we give the money to spend on each other , they become different teams and , in fact , they dominate the league by the time they ' re done.
It ' s in fact , that you should stop thinking about which product to buy for yourself and try giving some of it to other people instead.
You and I can go on and buy it for them.
Go to the website and start yourself on the process of thinking , again , less about  " How can I spend money on myself ?  " 
At TED2009 , Tim Berners-Lee called for  " raw data now "  -- for governments , scientists and institutions to make their data openly available on the web . At TED University in 2010 , he shows a few of the interesting results when the data gets linked up.
Last year here at TED I asked you to give me your data , to put your data on the web , on the basis that if people put data onto the web -- government data , scientific data , community data , whatever it is -- it will be used by other people to do wonderful things , in ways that they never could have imagined.
So , let ' s roll the video.
Does this data affect things ?  Well , let ' s get back to 2008.
Well , there was too much of a correlation , he felt , between which houses were occupied by white people and which houses had water , and the judge was not impressed either.
This is U.K . government data , a completely independent site , Where Does My Money Go.
Yes , certainly you can do it over here.
And I ' m delighted to see a great competition between the U.K . in blue , and the U.S . in red.
It allows you to set your own criteria for what sort of things you want to look at.
I also talked about community-generated data -- in fact I edited some.
Each flash on this visualization -- put together by ITO World -- shows an edit in 2009 made to the Open Street Map.
Some places , perhaps not as much as they should be.
This is January , in time lapse , of people editing .. . that ' s the earthquake.
So , now we have , immediately , a real-time map showing where there are refugee camps -- rapidly became the best map to use if you ' re doing relief work in Port-au-Prince.
So , if you ' ve been involved in that at all , I just wanted to say : Whatever you ' ve been doing , whether you ' ve just been chanting ,  " Raw data now! " 
education,history,math,politics,science,short talk,space,technology,war
With it , they were hoping to capture the minds of people everywhere by being the first to conquer outer space.
One of the Russian scientists wrote at the time :  " We are about to create a new planet that we will call Sputnik.
You ' re watching snippets from  " Sputnik, "  my fifth documentary feature , which is just about completed.
But just three days later , on a day they called Red Monday , the media and the politicians told us , and we believed , that Sputnik was proof that our enemy had beaten us in science and technology , and that they could now attack us with hydrogen bombs , using their Sputnik rocket as an IBM missile.
It exploded an arms race.
For example , some here will remember this day , June 1958 , the National Civil Defense Drill , where tens of millions of people in 78 cities went underground.
Support for engineering , math and science -- education in general -- boomed.
 " Sputnik "  will soon be released.
http://www.ted.com/talks/joshua_walters_on_being_just_crazy_enough.html
Joshua Walters : On being just crazy enough
I reframe that as a positive because the crazier I get onstage , the more entertaining I become.
There ' s no audience like this to justify their rehearsal time.
 " Okay , Josh , why don ' t we give you some -- why don ' t we give you some Zyprexa.
I can feel your noise.
I could either deny my mental illness or embrace my mental skillness.
You ' re driven to do something that everyone has told you is impossible.
Some of them committed suicide.
Just be manic enough in which investors who are looking for entrepreneurs that have this kind of spectrum -- you know what I ' m talking about -- not maybe full bipolar , but they ' re in the bipolar spectrum -- where on one side , maybe you think you ' re Jesus , and on the other side maybe they just make you a lot of money.
So maybe , you know , there ' s no such thing as crazy , and being diagnosed with a mental illness doesn ' t mean you ' re crazy.
How much depends on where you fall in the spectrum.
biology,biomechanics,math,science,society,technology
We like to dance together , we like singing together.
Whoa! Now , that ' s what we call emergent behavior.
So what do we make of that ?  First of all , we know that you ' re all brilliant.
So to put the question a little more seriously , let ' s ask ourselves what are the minimum requirements for what you just did , for spontaneous synchronization.
Inanimate objects that might spontaneously synchronize themselves.
I mean , I ' m not saying the law of entropy is wrong -- it ' s not.
This is from a BBC show called  " Predators, "  and what we ' re looking at here are examples of synchrony that have to do with defense.
We ' re so used to choreography giving rise to synchrony.
I ' ll show you a computer model made by Iain Couzin , a researcher at Oxford , that shows how swarms work.
And third , they ' re all attracted to each other , but they try to keep a small distance apart.
But except for that difference , the rules are the same for both.
The prey move out in random directions , and then the rule of attraction brings them back together again , so there ' s this constant splitting and reforming.
That is , out of the desire to save itself , each creature is following these rules , and that leads to something that ' s safe for all of them.
There are many eyes to spot danger.
Yes , it ' s happening here.
There doesn ' t seem to be anything mystical about this.
A computer is , in a way , just another experiment.
If you see fireflies in North America , like so many North American sorts of things , they tend to be independent operators . They ignore each other.
The trees , mangrove trees , are filled with fireflies communicating with light.
Then on , and then off -- a 30th of a second , there.
For a long time it was not believed when the first Western travelers , like Sir Francis Drake , went to Thailand and came back with tales of this unbelievable spectacle.
Scientific papers were published saying it was twitching eyelids that explained it , or , you know , a human being ' s tendency to see patterns where there are none.
You can even be just a single cell.
Now , your pacemaker is not a single cell.
So this tendency towards order is not always a good thing.
It would be all atoms pulsating in unison , emitting light of one color , one frequency.
This is not Keith Barry doing a magic trick.
All right , so , I ' ve got a metronome , and it ' s the world ' s smallest metronome , the -- well , I shouldn ' t advertise.
Maybe you ' d better listen to them . I ' ll stand here.
And the reason is that they ' re not able to communicate.
So I ' m going to give them a chance to do that.
My wife pointed out to me that it will work better if I put both on at the same time because otherwise the whole thing will tip over.
And a clear case of that , was something that happened in London in the year 2000.
He would shoot his light saber across the abyss , making a blade of light , and then scamper across on this blade of light.
You ' re used to suspension bridges with big droopy cables on the top.
And within two days the bridge was closed to the public.
Interviewer : Not up and down ?  Boy : No.
Boy : About the second one.
Woman : I remember wanting to get off.
Boy : We had to do this because , to keep in balance because if you didn ' t keep your balance , then you would just fall over about , like , to the left or right , about 45 degrees.
Man : That ' s right . And it seemed obvious to me that it was probably the number of people on it.
Think of the bridge as being like this platform.
They all showed this strange sort of skating gait that they adopted once the bridge started to move.
Actually , I think the first person you ' ll see is the young engineer who was put in charge of this project . Okay.
Engineer : I felt I was disappointed about it.
This synchronized movement seemed to be driving the bridge.
Interviewer : Well , at last the simulated bridge is finished , and I can make it wobble.
Interviewer : Right . So if we get on it , we should be able to wobble it , yes ? 
AM : It doesn ' t have to be a real dangle . Just walk . It starts to go.
Interviewer : No . If you try and put one foot in front of another , it ' s moving your feet away from under you . AM : Yes.
Interviewer : For a more convincing experiment , I wanted my own opening-day crowd , the sound check team.
And the only way you can walk comfortably is by getting in step.
But I hope that you ' ll go outside and see the world in a new way , to see all the amazing synchrony around us . Thank you.

And he said ,  " This genetic resource, "  -- and I ' ll never forget the words --  " stands between us and catastrophic starvation on a scale we cannot imagine. " 
What he understood was that biological diversity -- crop diversity -- is the biological foundation of agriculture.
That indeed , a mass extinction was underway in our fields , in our agricultural system.
And when you go into the supermarket , you certainly don ' t see a lot of choices there.
Now , imagine each one of these varieties as being distinct from another about the same way as a poodle from a Great Dane.
But the interesting thing is that this diversity -- and the tragic thing is -- that this diversity is being lost.
In the United States , in the 1800s -- that ' s where we have the best data -- farmers and gardeners were growing 7,100 named varieties of apples.
I wouldn ' t tell them what it was , but it was in alphabetical order , and I would tell them to look for their names , their family names , their mother ' s maiden name.
They gave them their name.
So , I want to tell you that the piece of the good news is that the Fowler apple is still out there.
See , we used to have a lot of apples.
And then he has to go even further.
I get this question all the time . Why don ' t we just save the best one ? 
The other thing is that maybe that Fowler apple or maybe a variety of wheat that ' s not economical right now has disease or pest resistance or some quality that we ' re going to need for climate change that the others don ' t.
Why ?  As a raw material , as a trait we can use in the future.
In short , the answer is that in the future , in many countries , the coldest growing seasons are going to be hotter than anything those crops have seen in the past.
If agriculture hasn ' t experienced that , how could it be adapted ? 
And you can see that there ' s some difference between one growing season and another.
The agricultural system and , more importantly , the crops in the field in India have never experienced this before.
30 percent decrease of production in the context of increasing population , that ' s a food crisis . It ' s global in nature.
We have two rolls of the dice to get this right.
If you want to conserve seed for a long term and you want to make it available to plant breeders and researchers , you dry it and then you freeze it.
And then there are just daily disasters that take place in these buildings , financial problems and mismanagement and equipment failures , and all kinds of things , and every time something like this happens , it means extinction . We lose diversity.
You don ' t look in the eyes of a carrot seed quite in the way you do a panda bear , but it ' s very important diversity.
That ' s at 78 degrees north.
We worked with the Norwegian government and with the NorGen , the Norwegian Genetic Resources Program , to design this facility.
This is more than just an artist ' s dream , it ' s now a reality.
It ' s a tunnel , and you go into the tunnel , chiseled in solid rock , about 130 meters.
And I know that this tags me as a bit of a nerd , but ...
It ' s not very exciting , but if you know what ' s there , it ' s pretty emotional.
We ' re going up to over a million , and someday we ' ll basically have samples -- about 500 seeds -- of every variety of agricultural crop that can be stored in a frozen state in this facility.
Norway owns the mountain and the facility , but the depositors own the seed.
I can ' t think of anything else that ' s happened in my lifetime that way.
I can ' t look you in the eyes and tell you that I have a simple solution for that , but I can look you in the eyes and tell you that we can ' t solve any of those problems if we don ' t have crop diversity.
So , this is not something pretty and nice to do.
So , in a very real sense , I believe that we , as an international community , should get organized to complete the task.
We need to catalog it . It ' s a library of life , but right now I would say we don ' t have a card catalog for it.
So we need to be thinking a little bit in those terms.

We ' re entering a second generation of no progress in terms of human flight in space . In fact , we ' ve regressed.
They need to look forward to exploration ; they need to look forward to colonization ; they need to look forward to breakthroughs.
What we ' re looking forward to is -- what we ' re looking forward to is not only the inspiration of our children , but the current plan right now is not really even allowing the most creative people in this country -- the Boeing ' s and Lockheed ' s space engineers -- to go out and take risks and try new stuff.
That ' s the theme of my next 15 minutes here.
And there was a wonderful little short four-year time period when marvelous things happened.
The ones that flew and landed OK because there were no trained pilots who had good flying qualities by definition.
Well , who was inspired during that time period ? 
The jet age started : the missile age started . Von Braun was on there showing how to go to Mars -- and this was before Sputnik.
You notice here ' s a big jump when I was a little kid -- and I think that had something to do with giving me the courage to go out and try something that other people weren ' t having the courage to try.
And then I went in and I had a lot of fun building airplanes that people could build in their garages.
The most impressive airplane ever , I believe , was designed only a dozen years after the first operational jet.
We ' ve lost that capability . We abandoned it in  ' 72.
These things tend to happen every 25 years.
You know , a good example , of course , is the DARPA net.
The very first year , starting when Gagarin went in space , and a few weeks later Alan Shepherd , there were five manned space flights in the world -- the very first year.
There is no growth . There ' s no activity . There ' s no nothing.
We know how to do it for sub-orbital flying now , do it safe enough -- at least as safe as the early airlines -- so that can be done.
There ' s another one announced just last week.
I can ' t tell you when this will start , because I don ' t want my competition to know my schedule.
Oh , it ' s going to be so much fun.
 ' What do you use it for ?  '  Come over . It does Frogger. "  OK.
And the inventor is in this audience.
OK , I want to show you kind of a busy chart , but in it is my prediction with what ' s going to happen.
These people are taking money and putting it in an interesting area , and I think it ' s a lot better than they put it in an area of a better cell phone or something -- but they ' re putting it in very -- areas and this will lead us into this kind of capability , and it will lead us into the next really big thing and it will allow us to explore . And I think eventually it will allow us to colonize and to keep us from going extinct.
It went a whole life cycle without competition , took out of service . And we ' re stuck back here with the same kind of capability for military fighters and commercial airline travel that we had back in the late  ' 50s.
Relatively soon , you ' ll be able to buy a ticket and fly higher and faster than the highest-performance military operational airplane . It ' s never happened before.
OK , I look forward to a new  " capitalist ' s space race, "  let ' s call it.
America -- the world saw America as not being the leader in technology , and that was a very strong thing.
You cannot buy a ticket commercially to fly into space in America -- can ' t do it . You can buy it in Russia.
But , you know , would you have thought back in the  ' 60s , when the space race was going on , that the first commercial capitalist-like thing to do to buy a ticket to go to the moon would be in Russian hardware ? 
The Russians actually flew a supersonic transport before the Concorde.
This little thing says here : five times what NASA ' s doing by 2020 . I want to tell you , already there ' s about 1.5 billion to 1.7 billion investment in private space flight that is not government at all -- already , worldwide . If you read -- if you Google it , you ' ll find about half of that money , but there ' s twice of that being committed out there -- not spent yet , but being committed and planned for the next few years . Hey , that ' s pretty big.
And that is because it ' s us . It ' s private industry.
http://www.ted.com/talks/william_li.html
William Li : Can we eat to starve cancer ? 
So why should we care about blood vessels ? 
And these are the vessels of life , and , as I ' ll show you , they can also be the vessels of death.
Except in a few special circumstances : In women , blood vessels grow every month to build the lining of the uterus ; during pregnancy , they form the placenta , which connects mom and baby.
It does this through an elaborate and elegant system of checks and balances , stimulators and inhibitors of angiogenesis , such that , when we need a brief burst of blood vessels , the body can do this by releasing stimulators , proteins called angiogenic factors that act as natural fertilizer and stimulate new blood vessels to sprout.
And in these situations , angiogenesis is out of balance.
In total , there are more than 70 major diseases affecting more than a billion people worldwide , that all look on the surface to be different from one another , but all actually share abnormal angiogenesis as their common denominator.
This is a tumor : dark , gray , ominous mass growing inside a brain.
They start out as small , microscopic nests of cells that can only grow to one half a cubic millimeter in size ; that ' s the tip of a ballpoint pen.
Yet , without a blood supply , most of these cancers will never become dangerous.
In fact , if you actually block angiogenesis and prevent blood vessels from ever reaching cancer cells , tumors simply can ' t grow up.
And once those vessels invade the cancer , it can expand , it can invade local tissues.
We call this antiangiogenic therapy , and it ' s completely different from chemotherapy because it selectively aims at the blood vessels that are feeding the cancers.
And you can see that the halo of blood flow disappears after treatment.
It invaded into his lungs.
And we subsequently treated more than 600 dogs.
So we created an antiangiogenic paste.
It ' s a very , very deadly type of cancer called an angiosarcoma.
Now , obviously , antiangiogenic therapy could be used for a wide range of cancers.
So here ' s actually the patient survival data from eight different types of cancer.
But for other tumors and cancer types , the improvements have only been modest.
So I went back to the biology of angiogenesis and started thinking : Could the answer to cancer be preventing angiogenesis , beating cancer at its own game so the cancers could never become dangerous ? 
Now , the obvious thing is to think about what we could remove from our diet , what to strip out , take away.
Our search for this has taken us to the market , the farm and to the spice cabinet , because what we ' ve discovered is that mother nature has laced a large number of foods and beverages and herbs with naturally occurring inhibitors of angiogenesis.
So let me show you what happens when we put in an extract from red grapes.
And extract from soybeans.
So here are four different teas that we ' ve tested.
This means there ' s food synergy.
So the shorter the bar , less angiogenesis , that ' s good.
You can see , they clearly hold their own and , in some cases , they ' re more potent than the actual drugs.
Now , I ' ve shown you a bunch of lab data , and so the real question is : What is the evidence in people that eating certain foods can reduce angiogenesis in cancer ? 
So this human study is a prime example of how antiangiogenic substances present in food and consumed at practical levels can impact on cancer.
And , in fact , some insurance companies are already beginning to think along these lines.
Because it turns out that adipose tissue , fat , is highly angiogenesis dependent.
And the bottom curve is the weight of a normal mouse.
Stop the treatment , it gains the weight back.
In other words , we can ' t create supermodel mice.
And that ' s what I think the world needs now . Thank you.
Do you recommend pursuing these treatments now , for most cancer patients ? 
So consider the approved ones , look for clinical trials , but then between what the doctor can do for you , we need to start asking what can we do for ourselves.
JC : Right . And along those lines , for people who might have risk factors for cancer , would you recommend pursuing any treatments sort of prophylactically or simply pursuing the right diet with lots of tomato sauce ? 
JC : Okay . Well , thank you so much.

I ' ve designed puzzles for books , printed things.
I do toys . The bulk of my work is in computer games.
I ' ll have him cut out letters out of construction paper for the board. " 
The question is , which letter is it if I unfold it ? 
Yeah , a lot of you got it.
This was something really original . I got hooked.
A puzzle is a problem that is fun to solve and has a right answer.
Who designed this ? 
But as opposed to a couple other forms of play , toys and games -- by toy I mean , something you play with that doesn ' t have a particular goal.
I consider that puzzles are an art form.
But at best they can reach for something more and create a memorable impression.
So , it ' s two profiles in black , or a white vase in the middle.
Here is what I did with figure and ground.
The background to one is the other.
A few other things . Here is my name.
Each letter here is one of these digits.
It ' s the same this way.
So here we have Penn and Teller , same upside-down.
Now how would you do it interactively ? 
Now , if you could pick up the black vase , it would look like the figure on top.
The goal here is to take the pieces on the left and make them so they look like the shape on the right.
I ' ll just go one step further.
Here is another thing you can do.
The goal is to get the red car out . It ' s a sliding block puzzle.
Well , that ' s too simple , let ' s add another piece.
Now we ' ll make it harder , a little harder.
You ' re going to move the blue one up in order to get the lavender one to the right.
I didn ' t come up with the original idea . But this is another way I work as an inventor is to create a sequel.
Created a whole bunch of levels for it.
Garry Trudeau calls himself an investigative cartoonist.
And I said ,  " Well , how on Earth can you come up with a sequence of the base pairs in DNA ?  " 
You know , you can ' t cut out the pieces and move them around.
But it takes some persistence.
Which way will these fall ? 
I separated this image into cyan , magenta , yellow , black , the basic printing colors , and then mixed up the separations , and you get these peculiar pictures.
She could easily be up here giving a talk about her work.
First of all , you know , for a long time computer games meant things like  " Doom, "  where you ' re going around shooting things , very violent games , very fast , aimed at teenage boys . Right ?  That ' s who plays computer games.
Then recently  " Rock Band "  has been a big hit.
Now , within that there is some interesting things happening.
Turns out doing crossword puzzles can stave off some of the effects of Alzheimer ' s.
Everybody now considers themselves a creator , and not just a viewer.
They ' re part of your life . They ' re not necessarily a separate thing.
Our first game is called  " Photo Grab. "  The game takes about a minute and 20 seconds.
Where is that ? 
Oh , yeah . There , okay . J-O and -- I guess that ' s that part . We got the bow . That bow helps.
Anybody ? 
And we have people all over the world doing that now.
culture,gender,self,social change,women
I ' m very happy to be here in India.
And it ' s in men as well as in women.
And it is essential to balance , to wisdom and to actually the future of all of us.
I think the whole world has essentially been brought up not to be a girl.
To be a woman means not to be a girl.
And I ' d also like to say that the irony of course , is that denying girl , suppressing girl , suppressing emotion , refusing feeling has lead thus here.
I want to talk a little bit about the Democratic Republic of Congo.
I essentially lived in the rape mines of the world for the last 12 years.
In the Congo , for those of you who don ' t know , there has been a war raging for the last 12 years , a war that has killed nearly six million people.
And I will tell you that what happened is through that shattering , listening to the stories of eight-year-old girls who had their insides eviscerated , who had guns and bayonets and things shoved inside them so they had holes , literally , inside them where their pee and poop came out of them.
That shattering , that opening of my girl cell , that kind of massive breakthrough of my heart allowed me to become more courageous , and braver , and actually more clever than I had been in the past in my life.
And he would actually say , while he was beating me ,  " Don ' t you cry . Don ' t you dare cry. " 
And I want to say we ' ve annihilated it in men as well as in women.
And I think we have taught men to be secure when they are insecure , to pretend they know things when they don ' t know things , or why would we be where we are ? 
And all these men , literally at least 10 men , were in their little seats watching chick flicks.
But I just want to say that I ' ve met girls with knife wounds and cigarette burns , who are literally being treated like ashtrays.
I ' ve seen that we cut girls and we control them and we keep them illiterate , or we make them feel bad about being too smart.
The selling of girls is rampant across the planet.
The burden of all the household tasks usually falls on girls and younger siblings , which ensures that they will never overcome these barriers.
I want to change the verb.
And I have to now share a few stories of girls I ' ve seen across the planet who have engaged their girl , who have taken on their girl in spite of all the circumstances around them.
There is a girl who I met 14 years ago in Afghanistan who I have adopted as my daughter because her mother was killed . Her mother was a revolutionary.
And she knew she risked death and she was literally gunned down and rolled over by that tank.
And she looked into her baby ' s eyes and she said ,  " Of course I love my baby . How could I not love my baby ? 
Dorcas is 15 years old , and she was trained in self-defense.
In Kenya , in August , I went to visit one of the V-Day safe houses for girls , a house we opened seven years ago with an amazing woman named Agnes Pareyio.
She taught girls what a healthy vagina looked like , and what a mutilated vagina looked like.
And she said ,  " Well , now , I need a house. " 
She has literally become deputy mayor.
And there was a young girl named Jaclyn.
And she knew that meant she would be cut.
So , one afternoon , she ' d heard about the safe house , Jaclyn left her father ' s house and she walked for two days , two days through Masai land.
Agnes took her in , and Agnes loved her , and Agnes supported her for the year.
In that hut , we walked in , and her father and his four wives were sitting there , and her sisters who had just returned because they had all fled when she had fled , and her primary mother , who had been beaten in standing up for her with the elders.
And I give you my word , here and now , that we will not cut your sisters either. " 
For me , that is the power of girls.
And I want to do it for Sunitha.
And it happened because I met a girl in Watts , L.A.
I ' m an emotional creature! " 
Things do not come to me as intellectual theories or hard-pressed ideas.
I can feel the invisible stirrings in the air.
Everything is intense to me , the way I walk in the street , the way my momma wakes me up , the way it ' s unbearable when I lose , the way I hear bad news.
They make me present . They make me ready . They make me strong.
Oh , I know when the coconut ' s about to fall.
I know that one kiss could take away all my decision-making ability.
It ' s how the earth got made , how the wind continues to pollinate.
I can take you back.
I am an emotional , I am an emotional , incondotional , devotional creature.

Ron Eglash on African fractals
And if he does this an infinite number of times , which you can do in mathematics , he ends up with an infinite number of lines , each of which has an infinite number of points in it.
He was a very religious man.
And so he came up with this beautiful curve.
It ' s the same pattern at many different scales.
They said these are pathological curves , and we don ' t have to discuss them.
If you take your thumb and your index finger and look right where they meet -- go ahead and do that now -- -- and relax your hand , you ' ll see a crinkle , and then a wrinkle within the crinkle , and a crinkle within the wrinkle . Right ? 
It ' s very ironic . And I ' ll show you a little natural recursion here.
Nature uses self-organizing systems.
So I got a Fulbright scholarship to just travel around Africa for a year asking people why they were building fractals , which is a great job if you can get it.
And it turns out the royal insignia has a rectangle within a rectangle within a rectangle , and the path through that palace is actually this spiral here.
The Ba-ila built this village about 400 meters in diameter.
Here ' s one house with the sacred altar , here ' s the house of houses , the family enclosure , with the humans here where the sacred altar would be , and then here ' s the village as a whole -- a ring of ring of rings with the chief ' s extended family here , the chief ' s immediate family here , and here there ' s a tiny village only this big.
So it ' s just like Georg Cantor said , the recursion continues forever.
I came up with this structure here.
So , when I got to the village , I said ,  " Can you take me to the square building ? 
And the recursion in some of these villages continues down into very tiny scales.
Now , the tiniest calabash in here keeps the woman ' s soul.
Aren ' t these scaling patterns just universal to all indigenous architecture ? 
I started collecting aerial photographs of Native American and South Pacific architecture ; only the African ones were fractal.
Here ' s an aerial photograph of one of the Anasazi ruins ; you can see it ' s circular at the largest scale , but it ' s rectangular at the smaller scale , right ? 
First of all , I agree with Mudimbe ' s wonderful book ,  " The Invention of Africa, "  that Africa is an artificial invention of first colonialism , and then oppositional movements.
And finally , well , isn ' t this just intuition ? 
Well , it ' s true that some African fractals are , as far as I ' m concerned , just pure intuition.
In some cases , there would actually be algorithms , and very sophisticated algorithms.
But they do it recursively , and they do it with an age-grade system , so the little kids learn this one , and then the older kids learn this one , then the next age-grade initiation , you learn this one.
It ' s called Owari in Ghana , where I studied it ; it ' s called Mancala here on the East Coast , Bao in Kenya , Sogo elsewhere.
Here ' s a wonderful fractal.
So I tracked down one of the folks who makes these things , this guy in Mali just outside of Bamako , and I asked him ,  " How come you ' re making fractal fences ?  Because nobody else is. " 
He said ,  " but wind and dust goes through pretty easily.
Right ?  It ' s just like a cost-benefit analysis.
And the same divination system is found all over Africa.
They said ,  " No , no , I can ' t tell you about this. " 
And I started explaining why I was there in Africa , and they got very excited when they saw the Cantor set.
But I had to sleep with a kola nut next to my bed , buried in sand , and give seven coins to seven lepers and so on.
So even plus odd gives you odd.
And then you take this symbol , and you put it back in so it ' s a self-generating diversity of symbols.
In the 12th century , Hugo of Santalla brought it from Islamic mystics into Spain.
And he said ,  " Well , instead of using one stroke and two strokes , let ' s use a one and a zero , and we can count by powers of two. " 
And I know Brian Eno says there ' s not enough Africa in computers , but you know , I don ' t think there ' s enough African history in Brian Eno.
The National Science Foundation ' s Broadening Participation in Computing program recently awarded us a grant to make a programmable version of these design tools , so hopefully in three years , anybody ' ll be able to go on the Web and create their own simulations and their own artifacts.
We ' ve started a pilot program in Ghana.
Bernard Tschumi at Columbia University has finished using this in a design for a museum of African art.
Actually , the reason that Google was such a success is because they were the first ones to take advantage of the self-organizing properties of the web.
Self-organization is why the AIDS virus is spreading so fast.
These are ways of doing self-organization -- of doing entrepreneurship -- that are gentle , that are egalitarian.

The last 50 years have seen a revolution in what it means to be a family.
Now , here ' s the bad news.
Just when they stop needing our help taking a bath , they need our help dealing with cyberstalking or bullying.
The parents predicted the kids would say , spending more time with them.
Are there concrete things we can do to reduce stress , draw our family closer , and generally prepare our children to enter the world ? 
At 7 p.m . on a Sunday in Hidden Springs , Idaho , where the six members of the Starr family are sitting down to the highlight of their week : the family meeting.
One has lacrosse on the near side of town.
Instead of turning to friends or relatives , they looked to David ' s workplace.
You have constant feedback . You have daily update sessions.
And these meetings had this effect while taking under 20 minutes.
Companies followed the waterfall method , right , in which executives issued orders that slowly trickled down to programmers below , and no one had ever consulted the programmers.
He read 30 years of Harvard Business Review before stumbling upon an article in 1986 called  " The New New Product Development Game. " 
In Sutherland ' s system , companies don ' t use large , massive projects that take two years.
You succeed or fail quickly.
Even the Sutherlands told me that they had an Agile Thanksgiving , where you had one group of people working on the food , one setting the table , and one greeting visitors at the door.
So the Starrs , in adapting this to their home , created a morning checklist in which each child is expected to tick off chores.
 " That ' s what I thought, "  she said.
And he made a checkmark.
But the real change didn ' t come until we had these family meetings.
What worked well this week ? 
Like , thoughts and ideas go in , but none ever comes out , I mean at least not that are revealing.
Our kids love this process.
It turns out , by the way , our girls are little Stalins.
Three years later -- our girls are almost eight now -- We ' re still holding these meetings.
I think the time is right for an Agile Family Manifesto.
When I became a parent , I figured , you know what ? 
It ' s like they say in the Internet world : if you ' re doing the same thing today you were doing six months ago , you ' re doing the wrong thing.
The truth is , their ideas are stale , whereas in all these other worlds there are these new ideas to make groups and teams work effectively.
But for so many of us , it doesn ' t work in our lives.
We ' ll make Sunday meals more important. " 
You can take that 10 minutes and move it to any part of the day and have the same benefit.
She told me ,  " When you ' re discipling your children , sit in an upright chair with a cushioned surface.
The point is there are all these new ideas out there.
Plank number two : Empower your children.
But the single biggest lesson we learned is to reverse the waterfall as much as possible.
So one of my daughters threw out , you get five minutes of overreacting time all week.
I loved that . Spend the time however you want.
So you see , this is working . Now look , this system isn ' t lax.
The other one said ,  " Overreaction! Overreaction! " 
Children who plan their own goals , set weekly schedules , evaluate their own work build up their frontal cortex and take more control over their lives.
He said ,  " It ' s much better to drive into a ditch with a $6 allowance than a $60,000-a-year salary or a $6 million inheritance. " 
Jim Collins , the author of  " Good To Great, "  told me that successful human organizations of any kind have two things in common : they preserve the core , they stimulate progress.
So he led us through the process of creating a family mission statement.
My wife bought a flip chart.
We are travelers , not tourists.
A few weeks later , we got a call from the school.
The family mission statement was on the wall , and my wife said ,  " So , anything up there seem to apply ?  " 
Researchers at Emory gave children a simple  " what do you know "  test.
The children who scored highest on this  " do you know "  scale had the highest self-esteem and a greater sense they could control their lives.
Spend time retelling the story of your family ' s positive moments and how you overcame the negative ones.
When I first read that , I thought ,  " That sentence is inane.
I ' ve mentioned just three here today : Adapt all the time , empower the children , tell your story.
If the stick were ever found , all humankind would be happy.
That story perfectly captures for me the final lesson that I learned : Happiness is not something we find , it ' s something we make.
You don ' t need some grand plan . You don ' t need a waterfall.

Mark Shaw : One very dry demo
It ' s called Ultra-Ever Dry , and when you apply it to any material , it turns into a superhydrophobic shield.
So what ' s superhydrophobic ? 
A windshield coating is going to give you about 110 degrees.
When you have nanotechnology and nanoscience , what ' s occurred is that we ' re able to now look at atoms and molecules and actually control them for great benefits.
And it ' s not just water that this works with.
It ' s that afraid of the water.
And it has billions of interstitial spaces , and those spaces , along with the nanoparticles , reach up and grab the air molecules , and cover the surface with air.
I mean , many of you right now are probably going through your head.
It could be anything that ' s anti-icing , because if you don ' t have water , you don ' t have ice.
Without water , the bacteria won ' t survive.
It ' s going to happen . Wait for it . Wait for it.

♫ Jill Sobule : At a conference in Monterey by the big , big jellyfish tank , ♫ ♫ I first saw you and I got so shy . ♫ ♫ You see , I was a little paranoid  ' cause I might have been high . ♫ ♫ And I hadn ' t done that in ages and I won ' t do that again . ♫ ♫ But that ' s another story . ♫ ♫ Loved you forever and I ' ve been a big fan , ♫ ♫ the one-woman shows , I even rented  " Pat. "  ♫ ♫ I got enough nerve to come up to you , ♫ ♫ but little did I know one year later we ' d be doing this show . ♫ ♫ I sing . Julia Sweeney : I tell stories . Together : The Jill and Julia Show . ♫ ♫ Sobule : Sometimes it works . Sweeney : Sometimes it doesn ' t . ♫ ♫ Together : The Jill and Julia Show . ♫ ♫ Sweeney : At a conference in Monterey next to the big , big jellyfish tank , ♫ ♫ I first saw you and I wasn ' t so shy . ♫ I made a beeline for you and told you what a huge fan I was ever since I was writing that pilot for Fox , and Wendy and I wanted you to do the theme song.
And also , I can ' t believe that we ' re eating sushi in front of the fish tank , which , personally , I think is really inappropriate.
♫ And that guy ,  " Seven Years in Tibet, "  turned out to be a Nazi . ♫ Sweeney : Yeah.
♫ Sobule : Paul McCartney , jealous of John , even more so now that he ' s gone . ♫ ♫ Dylan was so mean to Donovan in that movie . ♫ ♫ Pablo Picasso , cruel to his wives . ♫ Sweeney : Horrible.
♫ Sobule : Hillary supported the war . ♫ ♫ Sweeney : Even Thomas Friedman supported the war . ♫ ♫ Sobule : Colin Powell turned out to be .. . Together : .. . such a pussy . ♫ ♫ Sobule : William Faulkner , drunk and depressed , ♫ ♫ Tennessee Williams , drunk and depressed . ♫ Sweeney : Yeah.
And that was that she did two entire shows promoting that movie  " The Secret. " 
That movie is so horrible . It promotes such awful pseudoscience.
And all I ' m saying is that I really wish that Murray Gell-Mann would go on Oprah and just explain to her that the law of attraction is , in fact , not a law.
Insects and animals have evolved some amazing skills -- but , as Robert Full notes , many animals are actually over-engineered . The trick is to copy only what ' s necessary . He shows how human engineers can learn from animals '  tricks.
Welcome . If I could have the first slide , please ? 
The challenge of looking at nature ' s designs -- and I ' ll tell you the way that we perceive it , and the way we ' ve used it.
So , the answer is bio-mimicry : just copy nature directly.
Or think about the fact that if you build an automobile , I ' ll tell you that you also -- inside it -- have to put a factory that allows you to make another automobile.
And this is really important when you begin to look at animals.
They have way too many motions for their joints , too many muscles.
They all work like this kangaroo , they bounce.
And then they alternate in their propulsion , but the patterns are all the same . Almost every organism we ' ve looked at this way -- you ' ll see next week , I ' ll give you a hint , there ' ll be an article coming out that says that really big things like T . rex probably couldn ' t do this , but you ' ll see that next week.
Nobody in biology ever modeled it this way.
And many organisms fit this kind of pattern.
That ' s enough!
Think about the typical kind of robot that you see.
And here ' s one example that ' s really exciting.
They can embed sensors and actuators right in the form itself.
Our work has also inspired another robot , a biologically inspired bouncing robot , from the University of Michigan and McGill named RHex , for robot hexapod , and this one ' s autonomous.
This is a death ' s head cockroach . This is an American cockroach you think you don ' t have in your kitchen.
It actually leaps into the air , and has aerial phases when it does it , like a horse , and you ' ll see it ' s bouncing here.
So , we built a terrain that had obstacles three times the hip height of the animals that we ' re looking at.
We couldn ' t believe that it could do this . It said to us that if you could build a robot with very simple , springy legs , you could make it as maneuverable as any that ' s ever been built.
It ' s this technique of building the properties into the form.
It has the middle leg moving in synchrony with the front , and the hind leg on the other side . Sort of an alternating tripod , and they can negotiate obstacles just like the animal.
RF : Here ' s it going down a pathway.
We have one here and notice its position . It ' s holding on.
Okay . The point is it ' s really hard to tell , isn ' t it ?  It ' s incredible , we looked at students do this and they couldn ' t tell.
Like if we had a piece of tape now , we ' d peel it this way.
Here ' s the gecko running up a vertical surface . There it goes , in real time . There it goes again . Obviously , we have to slow this down a little bit.
Now , I want you to look at the animal ' s back.
Here ' s the animal that we have here , running on a vertical surface.
Here are the robots that they inspire , the Mecho-Geckos from iRobot.
Peeling in the animal . Peeling in the Mecho-Gecko -- that allows them climb autonomously . Can go on the flat surface , transition to a wall , and then go onto a ceiling.
What does the animal do ?  The animal has weird toes.
And if you blow those up , they have these little structures on the end.
Here ' s an individual hair with a little split end there.
No , force is too low . Do they do it by electrostatics ? 
How about suction ?  They stick on in a vacuum.
How do they do it then ?  Believe it or not , they grab on by intermolecular forces , by Van der Waals forces.
We also presented to Nike even.
Clearly , the Internet is already having eyes and ears , you have web cams and so forth . But it ' s going to also have legs and hands.
Thank you.

And if you ' re in this room today , most of us grew up in a world where we had basic civil rights , and amazingly , we still live in a world where some women don ' t have them.
190 heads of state -- nine are women.
And even in the non-profit world , a world we sometimes think of as being led by more women , women at the top : 20 percent.
A couple of years ago , I was in New York , and I was pitching a deal , and I was in one of those fancy New York private equity offices you can picture.
And so I said ,  " Did you just move into this office ?  " 
So the question is , how are we going to fix this ? 
In the high-income part of our workforce , in the people who end up at the top -- Fortune 500 CEO jobs , or the equivalent in other industries -- the problem , I am convinced , is that women are dropping out.
What are the messages we need to tell ourselves ? 
I don ' t have the right answer.
This is hard . I feel guilty sometimes.
One , sit at the table.
Just a couple weeks ago at Facebook , we hosted a very senior government official , and he came in to meet with senior execs from around Silicon Valley.
Don ' t you love that kind of thing from college ? 
And then Carrie reads all the books in the original Greek and Latin , goes to all the lectures.
The three of us go to the exam together , and we sit down.
And I say ,  " God , I really wish I had really connected John Locke ' s theory of property with the philosophers who follow. " 
The problem with these stories is that they show what the data shows : women systematically underestimate their own abilities.
And most importantly , men attribute their success to themselves , and women attribute it to other external factors.
Why does this matter ? 
Own your own success. " 
And everyone ' s nodding , because we all know this to be true.
In 2002 -- not so long ago -- a professor who was then at Columbia University took that case and made it Howard Roizen.
He then surveyed the students , and the good news was the students , both men and women , thought Heidi and Howard were equally competent , and that ' s good.
But Heidi ?  Not so sure.
We have to tell our daughters and our colleagues , we have to tell ourselves to believe we got the A , to reach for the promotion , to sit at the table , and we have to do it in a world where , for them , there are sacrifices they will make for that , even though for their brothers , there are not.
I said , okay , and she sat down , and we talked.
She said ,  " Well , you ' re giving this talk , and you said you were going to take two more questions.
We ' ve got to get women to sit at the table.
If a woman and a man work full-time and have a child , the woman does twice the amount of housework the man does , and the woman does three times the amount of childcare the man does.
And I don ' t think Sunday football-watching and general laziness is the cause.
When I go to the Mommy-and-Me stuff and I see the father there , I notice that the other mommies don ' t play with him.
Message number three : don ' t leave before you leave.
 " How am I going to fit this into everything else I ' m doing ?  " 
One woman came to see me about this , and I kind of looked at her -- she looked a little young.
I said ,  " You ' re thinking about this just way too early. " 
You need to feel like you ' re making a difference.
Keep your foot on the gas pedal , until the very day you need to leave to take a break for a child -- and then make your decisions.
We are not going to get to where 50 percent of the population -- in my generation , there will not be 50 percent of [women] at the top of any industry.
I think it would be a better world.

Sirena Huang dazzles on violin
I mean , what does this have to do with technology , entertainment and design ? 
Of course , I hope I can memorize it.
Okay . On the other hand by placing your finger in a different position on the fingerboard it changes the string length , that changes the frequency of the sound wave.
Isn ' t that cool ? 
This is small and lightweight.
The violin is very beautiful.
Entertainment -- I love the entertainment , but actually , the instrument itself isn ' t very entertaining.
A few years later I heard a joke about the greatest violinist , Jascha Heifetz.
Now , I know why I ' m here.
I mean , honestly , I ' d be happy enough if I can actually get my two dimension correct in school.
business,design,health,medicine,science,technology
Because we are all patients , we are all people.
You ' re looking at things where people are actually given information , and they ' re not following through with it.
Now behavior change is something that is a long-standing problem in medicine.
We talk about it in terms of engagement , or non-compliance.
One part of medicine , though , has faced the problem of behavior change pretty well , and that ' s dentistry.
It ' s the one great preventive health success we have in our health care system.
So this is an old experiment , but it ' s a really good one , because it was very simple , so it ' s an easy story to tell.
They divided them up into two groups.
They showed bloody gums.
They would get dentures , and if you got dentures , you weren ' t going to be able to eat corn-on-the-cob , you weren ' t going to be able to eat apples , you weren ' t going to be able to eat steak.
Now they measured one other variable.
And the people who said ,  " Yeah , yeah . I ' m pretty good about that, "  they were characterized as high efficacy , and the people who said ,  " Eh , I never get around to brushing and flossing as much as I should, "  they were characterized as low efficacy.
So fear showed up as not really the driver.
The notion of efficacy basically boils down to one -- that if somebody believes that they have the capacity to change their behavior.
Except , maybe we do.
This is still the way we ' re communicating messages about health.
Now here ' s what does work : personalized information works.
So you start with personalized data , personalized information that comes from an individual , and then you need to connect it to their lives.
But it actually hits home.
Finally , we need to be presented with a clear point of action.
It ' s a difficult and expensive commodity , until now.
And here ' s how they work in the feedback loop.
We either keep going fast , or we slow down.
They last for about five miles , in which case we put our foot back on the pedal.
But by and large , this is a feedback loop that ' s so nifty and too rare.
So I want to talk about , I want to shift now to think about how we deliver health information in this country , how we actually get information.
But it looks completely right.
Who among us would actually say that people read this ? 
So this is a different approach.
They went to the nutritional information box and saw that what works for cereal , works for our food , actually helps people understand what ' s in their food.
You can understand exactly what the benefits are.
Every time you take a drug , you ' re walking into a possible side effect.
What ' s another latent body of information that ' s out there that people are really not putting to use ? 
They ' re just not for us . They ' re not for people . They ' re not for patients.
You ask Tufte , and he would say ,  " Yes , this is the absolute worst presentation of information possible. " 
The after takes what was four pages -- that previous slide was actually the first of four pages of data that ' s just the general blood work.
It ' s an amazing notion that color could be used.
Likewise , you can go over your lipids and , again , understand what your overall cholesterol level is and then break down into the HDL and the LDL if you so choose.
But you don ' t have to wade through it . You don ' t have to go through the junk.
So that ' s our general blood work test.
Now the CRP test is often done following a cholesterol test , or in conjunction with a cholesterol test.
What you ' re actually measuring is spelled out in clean language.
The last one I ' ll show you is a PSA test.
And so we spent a good deal of our time indicating that.
And then again , the follow-up actions.
Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp , the two largest lab testing companies -- last year , they made profits of over 700 million dollars and over 500 million dollars respectively.
It ' s the person who actually , in the end , is going to be having to change their lives and then start adopting new behaviors.
It ' s being lost.
And the only acceptable answer is -- -- yes.
How do I integrate this information into the longer course of my life ? 
Ordinary people are capable of understanding this information , if we only go to the effort of presenting it to them in a form that they can engage with.
And this information is out there.
What if human consciousness isn ' t the end-all and be-all of Darwinism ?  What if we are all just pawns in corn ' s clever strategy game to rule the Earth ?  Author Michael Pollan asks us to see the world from a plant ' s-eye view.
It ' s a simple idea about nature.
It ' s very powerful for , I think , changing our relationship to the natural world and to the other species on whom we depend.
Like a lot of my ideas , like a lot of the tools I use , I found it in the garden ; I ' m a very devoted gardener.
And the question I asked myself that afternoon in the garden , working alongside that bumblebee , was : what did I and that bumblebee have in common ? 
And that bee , no doubt , assumed that it had decided ,  " I ' m going for that apple tree , I ' m going for that blossom , I ' m going to get the nectar and I ' m going to leave. " 
Because , of course , the bee thinks he ' s in charge or she ' s in charge , but we know better.
And the bee has been cleverly fooled into taking the nectar , and also picking up some powder on its leg , and going off to the next blossom.
And that ' s when I got the idea , which was ,  " Well , what would happen if we kind of looked at us from this point of view of these other species who are working on us ?  " 
And suddenly mowing the lawn that day was a completely different experience.
I ' m a dupe . I ' m a dupe of the lawns , whose goal in life is to outcompete the trees , who they compete with for sunlight. " 
That a certain kind of potato , a certain kind of drug , a sativa-indica Cannabis cross has something to say about us.
Which is , does it make us better citizens of the biotic community ? 
As an intellectual matter , looking at the world from other species '  points of view helps us deal with this weird anomaly , which is -- and this is in the realm of intellectual history -- which is that we have this Darwinian revolution 150 years ago ...
We are still Cartesians -- the children of Descartes -- who believe that subjectivity , consciousness , sets us apart ; that the world is divided into subjects and objects ; that there is nature on one side , culture on another.
And it ' s kind of natural that we would think it was the best tool.
I ' ll give you two examples , also from the garden : lima beans . You know what a lima bean does when it ' s attacked by spider mites ? 
Their complexity , their sophistication , is something to really marvel at , and I think it ' s really the scandal of the Human Genome Project.
Well , we ' re all equally sophisticated.
Now , the other use of this is practical.
And you will see , the amount of corn planted this year will be up dramatically from last year and there will be that much more habitat because we ' ve decided ethanol is going to help us.
This is a farm in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia.
the idea is he ' s got six different species of animals , as well as some plants , growing in this very elaborate symbiotic arrangement.
It ' s a very elaborate and beautiful dance , but I ' m going to just give you a close-up on one piece of it , and that is the relationship between his cattle and his chickens , his laying hens.
The only technology involved here is this cheap electric fencing : relatively new , hooked to a car battery ; even I could carry a quarter-acre paddock , set it up in 15 minutes.
The Eggmobile is a very rickety contraption -- it looks like a prairie schooner made out of boards -- but it houses 350 chickens.
But he waits that long to grow them as big and juicy and tasty as he can because they are the chickens '  favorite form of protein.
They then move out to the next one , and in the course of just a few weeks , the grass just enters this blaze of growth.
So , it ' s a very productive system.
again , give each species what it wants , let it realize its desires , its physiological distinctiveness.
When a ruminant grazes grass , the grass is cut from this height to this height , and it immediately does something very interesting.
This is how soil is created.
More for us , less for nature.
This is well beyond organic agriculture , which is still a Cartesian system , more or less.

Sergey Brin and Larry Page on Google
The answer is boxers.
SB : What is it ? 
This is what we run at the office , that actually runs real time.
And they ' re labeled by color right now , by language.
We have Tokyo coming in in Japanese.
And Europe , which is right now in the middle of the day , is going really strong with a whole wide variety of languages.
And this is something that we should really work on , which is Africa , which is just a few trickles , basically in South Africa and a few other urban cities.
And if we had it plotted correctly , I think the International Space Station would have it , too.
It has to go all over the world : through fibers , through satellites , through all kinds of connections.
And if we can switch to slides -- all right , here we go.
Now , each one of those queries has an interesting life and tale of its own.
You can see that it got started right here.
And then from Spain , it went to Italy , and then Germany got excited , and maybe right now the U.K . is enjoying it.
As a part of -- you know , part of what we want to do to grow our company is to have more searches.
We also have a program already called Google Grants that now serves over 150 different charities around the world , and these are some of the charities that are on there.
One of the earlier results that we got -- we have a Singaporean businessman who is now sponsoring a village of 25 Vietnamese girls for their education , and that was one of the earliest results . And as I said , now there have been many , many stories that have come in , because we do have hundreds of charities in there , and the Google Foundation will be an even broader endeavor.
SB : Yes! Somebody got it.
I ' ll explain it in a second.
Orkut had a vision to create a social network.
We just released it in a test phase last month , and it ' s been taking off.
So this is how -- we just deployed it -- we just decided that people would send each other invitations to get into the service , and so we just had the people in our company initially send them out.
So it ' s a fun little project.
Larry , you can explain this one.
And many , many things at Google have come out of that , such as Orkut and also Google News.
And News , which I just mentioned , was started by a researcher.
And then , besides just looking cute on a baby ' s bottom , we made it a Googlette , which is basically a small project at Google.
And now it ' s a real , full-blown project with more people on it.
You know , the Googlettes -- that ' s a small project that we ' re not quite sure if it ' s going to work or not , but we hope it will , and if we do enough of them , some of them will really work and turn out , such as News.
Don ' t really pay attention to them.
And so that ' s basically what we ' ve done since we instituted that a few years ago , and I think it has really allowed us to be innovative and still stay reasonably well-organized.
So this is a new -- how many of you use the Google Toolbar ? 
But if you go to our site and search for  " Deskbar, "  you ' ll get this.
This is another example of a project that somebody at Google was really passionate about , and they just , they got going , and it ' s really , really a great product , and really taking off.
We also like to innovate in our physical space , and we noticed in meetings , you know , you have to wait a long time for projectors to turn on and off , and they ' re noisy , so people shut them off.
And things like that . And simple things like this can really make a big difference.
This is actually our  " cult picture. " 
A lot of work happens in companies from people knowing each other , and informally.
In the early days , we were actually advised we should never change our logo because we should establish our brand , you know , because , you know , you ' d never want to change your logo.
One of the things that really excites me about what we ' re doing now is we have this thing called AdSense , and this is a little bit foreshadowing -- this is from before Dean dropped out.
And so we use our over 150,000 advertisers and millions of advertisements , so we pick the one that ' s most relevant to what you ' re actually looking at , much as we do on search.
And , you know , thank you.
So this session is supposed to be about the future , so I ' d thought I ' d talk at least briefly about it.
And in fact , the ultimate search engine would be smart.
And so I just wanted to give a funny example of this.
So ,  " related searches, "  right there . You can ' t see it that well , but we decided we should put in this feature into our AdSense ads , called  " related searches. " 
And our algorithms -- not a person , of course , but our algorithms , our computers -- read his blog and decided that the related search was ,  " I am bored. " 
And then , you know , he got even more mad , and he wrote -- like , started swearing and so on.
So with that , maybe I can switch back to the world.
The other thing I wanted to mention just briefly is that we have a tremendous ability and responsibility to provide people the right information , and we view ourselves like a newspaper or a magazine -- that we should provide very objective information.
And I think decisions we ' re able to make like that have a tremendous impact on the world , and it makes me really proud to be involved with Google.

I am a proud Princeton dropout.
So , I ' m also fairly determined to try and build a game layer on top of the world.
And it looks like this right now.
There are credit card schemes and airline mile programs and coupon cards and all these loyalty schemes that actually do use game dynamics and actually are building the game layer : they just suck.
And the tools , the resources that we use to build a game layer are game dynamics themselves.
Just before we jump into that , there ' s sort of a question of : why is this important ? 
There ' s still a lot of people who are trying to figure out social and how do we leverage this and how do we use this , but the framework itself is done , and it ' s called Facebook.
They own half a billion people.
But this next decade -- and that ' s a real thing.
It ' s not about adding a social fabric to the Web and connecting you to other people everywhere you are and everywhere you go.
And so it ' s incredibly critical that at this moment , while it ' s just getting constructed , while the frameworks like Facebook , like the Open Graph , are being created for the game layer equivalent , that we think about it very consciously , and that we do it in a way that is open , that is available , and that can be leveraged for good.
The resources are mindshare and the tools , the raw materials are these game dynamics.
So the first one , it ' s a very simple game dynamic.
This sort of loss of free will that occurs in games can be frightening , so with each dynamic , I ' m going to give three examples : one that shows how this is already being used in the real world , so you can sort of rationalize it a little bit ; one that shows it in what we consider a conventional game -- I think everything is a game , but this is sort of more of a what you would think is a game played on a board or on a computer screen , and then one how this can be used for good , so we can see that these forces can really be very powerful.
Come here at a certain time , get your drinks half off.
It also exists in more conventional game forms.
Farmville has more active users than Twitter.
So if they wanted the world to end , if they wanted productivity to stop , they could make this a 30-minute cycle , and no one could do anything else , right ? 
That ' s an appointment.
You should get points for doing this on time.
We ' re going to jump onto the next one , maybe . Yes.
It ' s used in your wallets , right now.
So they whip it out . And you see men , they have that black card.
I ' m only a level four , but I desperately want to be a level 10 , because they ' ve got that cool red badge thing , and that means that I am somehow better than everyone else.
There are levels . There are C . There are B . There is A.
But let ' s use it consciously . Like why have games that you can lose ? 
And it ' s very powerful.
I am only 85 percent complete on LinkedIn , and that bothers me.
I mean , you see this is a paladin level 10 , and that ' s a paladin level 20 , and if you were going to fight , you know , orcs on the fields of Mordor against the Raz al Ghul , you ' d probably want to be the bigger one , right.
The average player spends something like six , six-and-a-half hours a day on it.
It can also be used in very compelling ways for good.
And we ' ve introduced a progression dynamic into it , where , by going to the same place over and over , by doing challenges , by engaging with the business , you move a green bar from the left edge of the screen to the right edge of the screen , and you eventually unlock rewards.
And communal discovery is powerful because it leverages the network that is society to solve problems.
They had a leader board , where , if you recommended the best stories , you would get points.
And they actually had to end up shutting down the leader board because while it was effective , it was so powerful that it stopped sourcing the best stories and started having people work to maintain their leadership.
But it can also be used to find real things.
And in 12 hours , they were able to find all these balloons , all across the country , right.
We use game dynamics to build on it . We build with mindshare.

Tim Brown urges designers to think big
I thought , at the time , I did a pretty good job.
Again , 18 months later , the product was obsolete.
But I think this small view of design is a relatively recent phenomenon , and in fact really emerged in the latter half of the 20th century as design became a tool of consumerism.
But this wasn ' t always the way.
His greatest creation runs actually right through here in Oxford.
Now , what Brunel said that he wanted to achieve for his passengers was the experience of floating across the countryside.
He imagined an integrated transportation system in which it would be possible for a passenger to embark on a train in London and disembark from a ship in New York.
Now , design thinking begins with what Roger Martin , the business school professor at the University of Toronto , calls integrative thinking.
So somehow , we went from this to this.
I ' m a fully paid-up member of that priesthood , and somewhere in here I have my designer glasses.
And as we see this reemergence of design thinking and we see it beginning to tackle new kinds of problems , there are some basic ideas that I think we can observe that are useful.
What makes life easier , more enjoyable ? 
So when a team was working on a new vision screening program in India , they wanted to understand what the aspirations and motivations were of these school children to understand how they might play a role in screening their parents.
So it took a team working in India with patients and community health workers to understand how a PDA and an application on a PDA might replace those technicians in a fitting and diagnostic service.
Now , prototypes speed up the process of innovation , because it is only when we put our ideas out into the world that we really start to understand their strengths and weaknesses.
Now , they are very efficient , but they are also very innovative.
These are the lenses that replace those that are damaged by cataracts.
And instead of installing the large-scale machines used by western producers , they used low-cost CAD/CAM prototyping technology.
So I ' d like to take the idea that Rory Sutherland talked about , this notion that intangible things are worth perhaps more than physical things , and take that a little bit further and say that I think the design of participatory systems , in which many more forms of value beyond simply cash are both created and measured , is going to be the major theme , not only for design , but also for our economy as we go forward.
So in one of their projects called Southwark Circle , they worked with residents in Southwark , South London and a small team of designers to develop a new membership organization to help the elderly with household tasks.
Through a program of observational research , brainstorming new solutions and rapid prototyping , they ' ve developed a completely new way to change shift.
When you multiply that by all the nurses in all the wards in 40 hospitals in the system , it resulted , actually , in a pretty big impact.
And that connection is change.
But , again , we are in the midst of massive change.
Because it gives us a new way of tackling problems.
What ' s the design brief ? 
And one in particular , is one that we ' re working on with the Acumen Fund , in a project that ' s been funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
And through workshops they developed innovative new products , services , and business models.
Some of those ideas are just getting launched into the market.
And just like Brunel , by focusing on systems , we can have a bigger impact.
And if you ' ve got any ideas then feel free , you can post them to Twitter.
So I ' d like to believe that design thinking actually can make a difference , that it can help create new ideas and new innovations , beyond the latest High Street products.
Sheena Iyengar studies how we make choices -- and how we feel about the choices we make . At TEDGlobal , she talks about both trivial choices and profound ones , and shares her groundbreaking research that has uncovered some surprising attitudes about our decisions.
Today , I ' m going to take you around the world in 18 minutes.
After a pause , the waiter said ,  " One does not put sugar in green tea. " 
 " One does not put sugar in green tea. " 
Well , since I couldn ' t have my tea the way I wanted it , I ordered a cup of coffee , which the waiter brought over promptly.
From my American perspective , when a paying customer makes a reasonable request based on her preferences , she has every right to have that request met.
Americans tend to believe that they ' ve reached some sort of pinnacle in the way they practice choice.
I ' d like to discuss some of these assumptions and the problems associated with them.
It is essential for success.
But do all individuals benefit from taking such an approach to choice ? 
The kids got to choose which pile of anagrams they would like to do , and they even got to choose which marker they would write their answers with.
With this procedure , we were able to ensure that the kids across the three groups all did the same activity , making it easier for us to compare performance.
In fact , some of the kids were visibly embarrassed when they were told that their mothers had been consulted.
The first-generation children were strongly influenced by their immigrant parents '  approach to choice.
Or , you could say that the individual ' s preferences were shaped by the preferences of specific others.
Yet that is exactly what the American paradigm demands.
The second assumption which informs the American view of choice goes something like this.
Let ' s test this assumption by heading over to Eastern Europe.
During the very first session , which was run in Russia , one of the participants made a comment that really caught me off guard.
Again and again , they perceived these seven different sodas , not as seven choices , but as one choice : soda or no soda.
Of course , you and I know that Coke is the better choice.
They were flooded with choice before they could protest that they didn ' t know how to swim.
I am used to no choice. " 
They were never given a chance to learn how to react. " 
The value of choice depends on our ability to perceive differences between the options.
When someone can ' t see how one choice is unlike another , or when there are too many choices to compare and contrast , the process of choosing can be confusing and frustrating.
In other words , choice can develop into the very opposite of everything it represents in America when it is thrust upon those who are insufficiently prepared for it.
A number of my studies have shown that when you give people 10 or more options when they ' re making a choice , they make poorer decisions , whether it be health care , investment , other critical areas.
and then hop across the pond to France.
The baby was delivered through a C-section , but Barbara suffered cerebral anoxia , a loss of oxygen to the brain.
What do they do ? 
In all cases , the life support was removed , and the infants had died.
We found that it did.
American parents were more likely to say things like ,  " What if ?  What if ?  " 
But when the American parents were asked if they would rather have had the doctors make the decision , they all said ,  " No. " 
In her essay ,  " The White Album, "  Joan Didion writes ,  " We tell ourselves stories in order to live.
This narrative promises so much : freedom , happiness , success.
Americans have so often tried to disseminate their ideas of choice , believing that they will be , or ought to be , welcomed with open hearts and minds.
Moreover , Americans themselves could benefit from incorporating new perspectives into their own narrative , which has been driving their choices for so long.
When it comes to choice , we have far more to gain than to lose by engaging in the many translations of the narratives.
Rather , it teaches us when and how to act.
Sheena , there is a detail about your biography that we have not written in the program book.
And as you just mentioned , there ' s lots of choices out there that are very visual these days.
And one was called  " Ballet Slippers. " 
 " Okay , great. " 
And so I asked them ,  " Well , how do I tell them apart ? 
And the only thing they had consensus on : well , if I could see them , I would clearly be able to tell them apart.
50 percent of the women accused me of playing a trick , of putting the same color nail polish in both those bottles.

The middle line is millions of tons of plastic debris accumulating in our ocean , and the third line is radioactive material leaking from Fukushima nuclear power plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Well , that ' s exactly what I want to talk about today , is how we can use these natural forces to remediate these man-made problems.
I was working on a very interesting technology at MIT , but it was a very long-term view of how to develop technology , and it was going to be a very expensive technology , and also it would be patented.
If you ' re using the exact same amount of surface of oil absorbent , but you ' re just paying attention to natural patterns , and if you ' re going up the winds , you can collect a lot more material.
So the very simple idea was to use the ancient technique of sailing and tacking of the wind to capture or intercept the oil that is drifting down the wind.
So I built this small sailing robot with the rudder at the front , and I was trying to pull something very long and heavy , so that ' s a four-meter-long object just to pull , and I was surprised with just a 14-centimeter rudder , I could control four meters of absorbent.
Then I started publishing online , and some friends from Korea , they started being interested in this , and we made a boat which has a front rudder and a back rudder , so we started interacting with this , and it was slightly better , although it was very small and a bit off balance , but then we thought , what if we have more than two points of control ? 
And so that ' s the beginning of Protei , and that ' s the first boat in history that completely changed the shape of the hull in order to control it , and the properties of sailing that we get are very superior compared to a normal boat.
We ' re catching wind from both sides.
After this , we wanted to see if we could implement this and automate the system , so we used the same system but we added a structure to it so we could activate the machine.
And then we mounted a camera for controlling it , but quickly we saw that we would need a lot more weight at the bottom , so we had to take it back to the lab , and then we built a skin around it , we put batteries , remote controllers , and then we put it in the water and then we let it go in the water and see how well it would work , so let some rope out , and hope it ' s going to work , and it worked okay , but we still have a long way.
But I wanted to show you a fish because -- In fact , it ' s very different from a fish.
But new properties of a sailing boat.
Other property is this : A normal sailing boat has a centerboard here and a rudder at the back , and these two things are what creates most resistance and turbulence behind the boat , but because this doesn ' t have either a centerboard or a rudder , we hope that if we keep working on this hull design we can improve and have less resistance.
Normal technology or innovation happens like this : Somebody has an interesting idea , some other scientist or engineer , they take it to the next level , they make a theory about it and maybe they patent it , and then some industry will make a contract of exclusivity to manufacture and sell it , and then , eventually , a buyer will buy it , and we hope that they are going to use [it] for a good purpose.
You want everybody , like we ' re doing now , to work at the same time , and that can only happen if these people all together decide to share the information , and that ' s exactly what open hardware is about.
Essentially , open hardware is a license.
And I started this project alone in a garage in New Orleans , but quickly after I wanted to publish and share this information , so I made a Kickstarter , which is a crowd-fundraising platform , and in about one month we fundraised 30,000 dollars.
This idea really appealed to Gabriella Levine in New York , and so she decided to prototype this idea that she saw , and she documented every step of the process , and she published it on Instructables , which is a website for sharing inventions.
We ' re working on also simpler technology , not that complex , with younger people and also older people , like this dinosaur is from Mexico.
Business as usual is saying , what ' s most important is to make lots of profit , and you ' ll be using technology for that , and people will be your work force , instrumentalized , and environment is usually the last priority.
Thank you very much.
Then what we want to do is create six-meter versions so we can test the maximum performance of these machines , so we can go at very , very high speed.
And we replace the human being -- to go , for example , for measuring radioactivity , you don ' t want a human to be sailing those robots -- with batteries , motors , micro-controllers and sensors.

Peter Hirshberg on TV and the web
So it ' s about time that we talked about how the computer ambushed television , or why the invention of the atomic bomb unleashed forces that lead to the writers '  strike.
And I said , just arrange these , from what ' s important to you and what ' s not , and then tell me why.
Girls : Internet.
Girl 4 : I wouldn ' t like it.
Girl 5 : Because they ' re going to lose all their money eventually.
We go through periods of enthrallment , followed by reactions in boardrooms , in the finance community best characterized as , what ' s the finance term ?  Ick pooey.
By the way , this is about when I enter the picture.
And I had a happy brush with convergence until , kind of , Warner basically has to liquidate the whole thing.
But they were onto something and they got better at it.
For 50 years , it ' s been about hopes and fears and promises of a better world . And I got to thinking , you know , who else talks that way ? 
But it ' s this irrational view of things that drives us on to the next thing.
So take a look at what happens when the foremost journalist of early television meets one of the foremost computer pioneers , and the computer begins to express itself.
And this is the oscilloscope of the Whirlwind electronic computer.
Calvin Bolster : Well , Ed , this problem concerns the Navy ' s Viking rocket.
And on the right-hand side , there ' s a scale that shows the rocket ' s velocity.
How ' s that ? 
Journalist : Thank you very much indeed , Mr . Forrester and the MIT lab.
They adapt Whirlwind to a massive air defense system , deploy it all across the frozen north , and spend nearly three times as much on this computer as was spent on the Manhattan Project building the A-Bomb in the first place.
Narrator : In a mass raid , high-speed bombers could be in on us before we could determine their tracks.
This new computer , built to become the nerve center of a defense network , is able to perform all the complex mathematical problems involved in countering a mass enemy raid.
Or there ' s one other marketing proposition : if you don ' t use our product , you ' ll die.
You saw how huge it was , and to give you a sense for this -- because we ' ve talked a lot about Moore ' s law and making things small at this conference , so let ' s talk about making things large.
To build that , what we ' d do with Whirlwind technology is we ' d have to take up roughly from the 10 to Mulholland , and from the 405 to La Cienega just with those Whirlwinds.
So -- and we haven ' t even worked out the cooling needs.
It shows up at places like MIT , and then a mutation happens.
It shipped every one of its computers with that game.
And a quote that sounds largely reminiscent from everything I ' ve been reading all week.
And of course , as the computer industry develops interactively , producers in the emerging TV business actually hit on the same idea.
Put out your Magic Window and your erasing glove , and rub it like this.
You all set ?  OK , let ' s get right to the first story about Dusty Man.
 " Pete , I could use any ordinary open-source crayon , why do I have to buy theirs ?  " 
It led to lawsuits -- -- federal investigations , and lots of repercussions , and that ' s a scandal we won ' t discuss today.
It turns out there was a lot to learn about how this new medium worked.
Marshall McLuhan : If the audience can become involved in the actual process of making the ad , then it ' s happy . It ' s like the old quiz shows.
PH : You know , McLuhan talked about the global village.
It ' s a sort of Ann Landers '  column writ large.
We ' re now right into the 1960s.
And when I say that code expresses our hopes and aspirations , it ' s not just a joke about messianism , it ' s actually what we do.
In the midst of revolution in the streets and rock and roll concerts in the parks , a group of researchers led by people like John McCarthy , a computer scientist at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab , and Doug Engelbart , a computer scientist at SRI , changed the world.
People were leaving to go back to the land.
And into that ferment came the microprocessor.
I think these ideas are difficult to understand , because when you ' re trapped in one paradigm , the next paradigm is always like a science fiction universe -- it makes no sense.
Feed your head , feed your head , feed your head. " 
HyperCard was the first program to introduce the public to hyperlinks , where you could randomly hook to any kind of picture , or piece of text , or data across a file system , and we had no way of explaining it.
We asked a question about how the mind works , and we let our customers play the role of so many blind men filling out the elephant.
The most involved method is to go ahead and produce your own videodisc as well as build your own HyperCard stacks.
PH : I hope you realize how subversive that is.
By the way , speaking of the filing system , it never occurred to us that these hyperlinks could go beyond the local area network.
The year is 1993 and he was working on a book and I was working on a video to help him kind of explain where we were all heading and how to popularize all this.
Once it was only a dream of technoids and a few long-forgotten politicians.
Though some were incredulous .. . Man 1 : The phone company!
Voice 1 : Say , mom , Windows for Radio means more enjoyment and greater ease of use for the whole family.
And further stimulus came with the deregulation of the cable television industry , and the re-regulation of the cable television industry.
And the forces of convergence exploded.
Voice 2 : Next on the gourmet pet channel , decorating birthday cakes for your schnauzer.
It just goes to show how tough it is to come up with the right uses of media.
We come into the era of the dotcom , the World Wide Web , and I don ' t need to tell you about that because we all went through that bubble together.
It ' s a customer , it ' s an audience , it ' s a person who ' s participating.
That ' s about 2,700 fresh , connective links across about 112 million blogs that are out there.
But it ' s not a joke . This is a real headline.
To show you how schizophrenic this all is , here ' s the head of MySpace , or Fox Interactive , a News Corp company , being asked , well , with the writers '  strike , isn ' t this going to hurt News Corp and help you online ? 
Obviously , we hope that the strike is -- that the issues are resolved as quickly as possible.
Voice 1 : You ' ll have to stay here in the safe house until we get word the terrorist threat is over.
PH : The company that created this , Aniboom , is an interesting example of where this is headed . Traditional TV animation costs , say , between 80,000 and 10,000 dollars a minute.
For example , Nike now understands that Nike Plus is not just a device in its shoe , it ' s a network to hook its customers together.
We ' re in the business of connecting with consumers. " 
Or , as Geoffrey Moore once told me , it ' s intellectual curiosity that ' s the trade that brands need in the age of the blogosphere.
PH : So , to wrap up , I ' d love to throw it back to Marshall McLuhan , who , 40 years ago , was dealing with audiences that were going through just as much change , and I think that , today , traditional Hollywood and the writers are framing this perhaps in the way that it was being framed before.
They don ' t really notice the new medium that is wrapping them up.
There ' s been more raw DNA of communications and media thrown out there . Content is moving from shows to particles that are batted back and forth , and part of social communications , and I think this is going to be a time of great renaissance and opportunity.
Rob Forbes , the founder of Design Within Reach , shows a gallery of snapshots that inform his way of seeing the world . Charming juxtapositions , found art , urban patterns -- this slideshow will open your eyes to the world around you.
I was listed on the online biography that said I was a design missionary.
And I used three criteria : the first was , I thought I ' d talk about real design within reach , design that ' s free , not design not quite within reach , as we ' re fondly known by our competition and competitors , but stuff that you can find on the streets , stuff that was free , stuff that was available to all people , and stuff that probably contains some other important messages.
Wholly inconsistent with San Francisco or New York.
This led me to starting a company called Design Within Reach , a company dealing with simple forms , making good designers available to us , and also selling the personalities and character of the designers as well , and it seems to have worked.
I was walking around on the streets of Amsterdam and I recognized , you know , the big story from Amsterdam isn ' t what ' s in the design stores , it ' s what ' s out on the streets , and maybe it ' s self-explanatory , but a city that hasn ' t been taken over by modernism , that ' s preserved its kind of architecture and character , and where the bicycle plays an important part of the way in which people get around and where pedestrian rights are protected.
But I began looking at design in a place like Amsterdam and recognized , you know , the first job of design is to serve a social purpose.
He ' s a Spanish architect and designer.
And , approaching a building from a distance , you don ' t see too much ; you get a little closer , and you arrive at a nice little composition that might remind you of a Mondrian or a Diebenkorn or something.
They give me , I don ' t know , a sense of correctness in the world and some visual delight in the knowledge that the building will probably never look as good as this simple industrial scaffolding that is there to serve.
Antoine Predock designed a wonderful ball stadium in San Diego called Petco Park.
Red is a color in the landscape that is often on stop signs.
Side street in Italy.
Simple menus put on a board , achieving , kind of , the sort of balance.
I don ' t always know why I take photographs of things.
I ' ve come across some other just , kind of , curious relationships of bollards on the street that have different interpretations , but -- these things amuse me.
It ' s quite free of commercial clutter : you don ' t see our logos and brands and names , and therefore you ' re alert to things physically.
In our area , in furnishings , they ' re sort of way at the top.
The past and the present work quite well together in Italy also , and I think that it ' s recognizable there , and has an important effect on culture , because their public spaces are protected , their sidewalks are protected , and you ' re actually able to confront these things physically , and I think this helps people get over their fear of modernism and other such things.
And as I look at it , I sort of say , you know , the publications that report on problems in the urban area also contribute to it , and it ' s just my call to say to all of us , public policy won ' t change this at all ; private industry has to work to take things like this seriously.
Now , this is not going to impress you guys who Photoshop , and can do stuff , but this was an actual moment when I got off my bike , and I looked and I thought , it ' s as if all of my biker brethren had kind of gotten together and conspired to make a little statement.
And I don ' t know if there ' s a stronger kind of effect than pattern and the way it unites kind of disparate elements.
I don ' t have very many shots of people , because they kind of get in the way of studying pure form.
And I do think pattern has the capability of eradicating some of the most evil forces of society , such as bad form in restaurants , but quite seriously , it was a statement to me that one thing that you do , sort of , see is the aggressive nature of the industrial world has produced -- kind of , large masses of things , and when you -- in monoculture , and I think the preservation of diversity in culture is something that ' s important to us.
A lot of the planning departments became subordinated to the transportation department . It ' s as easy to rag on cars as it is on Wal-Mart ; I ' m not going to do that.
We go there for stimulation in art and all those other things.
You would expect a city like this to have upgraded flower boxes on Michigan Avenue where wealthy people shop , but if you actually go along the street you find the flower boxes change from street to street : there ' s actual diversity in the plants.
There are a lot of free concerts , for example , that go on in this area ; it has a phenomenal acoustic system.
This is also in Millennium Park in Chicago , where the Spanish artist-designer Plensa has created , kind of , a digital readout in this park that reflects back the characters and personalities of the people in this area.
Design legend Niels Diffrient talks about his life in industrial design  . He details his quest to completely rethink the office chair starting from one fundamental data set : the human body.
When I was five years old I fell in love with airplanes.
He ' d always walk up to his airplane in a kind of saunter , devil-may-care saunter , flick the cigarette away , grab the girl waiting here , give her a kiss.
Everything about flying in those years , which was -- you have to stop and think for a moment -- was probably the most advanced technological thing going on at the time.
I think the word is the holistic experience revolving around a product.
Ze fuselage , ze empanage , ze nessal.
And I decided I had to get closer than just drawing fantasy airplanes.
You couldn ' t transfer those to the model itself.
And of course , as a model in those years , you couldn ' t control it.
And it had , once it was in the air , some of this romance that I was in love with.
I ' d wile away my time drawing airplanes in the class.
And he said ,  " Well for one thing , there are more girls there. " 
Went through design , some architecture.
Any of you who rode the automobiles -- was it yesterday ?  -- at the track , you know the romance revolving around those high performance cars.
And I started up a very small operation -- went from 40 people to one , in an effort to rediscover my innocence.
And I chose chairs specifically because I knew something about them.
And I found that there were ways to duplicate the same approach that I used to use on the airplane.
I should say one more thing . When I was doing those model airplanes , I did everything.
And I flew it.
I started with a lot of loose ideas , roughly eight or nine years ago.
So my idea was that , instead of sitting down and reaching for a lot of controls , that you would sit on the chair , and it would automatically balance your weight against the force required to recline.
I ' ll tell you right up front , this is a trade off.
They begin to fall off the end of your chart.
He said she had one of the new , better chairs.
He came over and looked at it.
Well , that ' s typical of a lot of us working in chairs.
The other thing I felt was that armrests had never really been properly approached from the standpoint of how much of an aid they could be to your work life.
And each of these things went along sort of in parallel but incrementally were a problem of their own.
And stop where you want.
And this was another thing that I felt , while not nearly as romantic as Cary Grant , nevertheless begins to grab a little bit of aesthetic operation , aesthetic performance into a product.
Would everybody put their hand under their bottom and feel their tailbone ? 
All the weight of your upper torso -- your arms , your head -- goes right down through your back , your spine , into those bones when you sit.
So to unload that great weight -- if that indeed exists -- you can recline.
But to do that , if you have any amount of recline , it gets to the point where you need a headrest because nearly always , automatically hold your head in a vertical position , see ? 
Now headrest is a challenge because you want it to adjust enough so that it ' ll fit , you know , a tall guy and a short girl.
And you need it in a different position when you ' re upright , then when you ' re reclined.
So that part of it took a long time to work out.
And I did want to demonstrate the fact that the chair can accommodate people.
animals,biotech,disease,global issues,insects,pandemic,science,technology
Now , when you talk about dangerous animals , most people might think of lions or tigers or sharks.
And the mosquito has killed more humans than wars and plague.
So 50 years ago , pretty much no one had heard of it , no one certainly in the European environment.
In the last 50 years , the incidence of dengue has grown thirtyfold.
You might go to India , the Far East.
They could be quite mild.
Now the odd thing is , is that once you ' ve been bitten by this mosquito , and you ' ve had this disease , your body develops antibodies , so if you ' re bitten again with that strain , it doesn ' t affect you.
So why is it spreading so fast ? 
Now , in fact , a single mosquito will only travel about 200 yards in its entire life . They don ' t travel very far.
To give you just a couple of examples how fast this has happened , in the mid- ' 70s , Brazil declared ,  " We have no Aedes aegypti, "  and currently they spend about a billion dollars now a year trying to get rid of it , trying to control it , just one species of mosquito.
So the one thing you ' ll find is that where the mosquito goes , dengue will follow.
Well , there ' s two principle ways.
You ' ve got to get your chemical into every puddle , every birdbath , every tree trunk.
Here what someone is doing is mixing up chemical in a smoke and basically spreading that through the environment.
Having said that , actually , your best form of protection and my best form of protection is a long-sleeve shirt and a little bit of DEET to go with it.
We want something that gets that population right the way down so it can ' t get the disease transmission.
We don ' t want to have a lasting impact on the environment.
We want something that ' s relatively cheap , or cost-effective , because there ' s an awful lot of countries involved , and some of them are emerging markets , some of them emerging countries , low-income.
This one ' s not . It ' s invaded you.
It ' s got to get into people ' s houses , into the bedrooms , into the kitchens.
It ' s just the female.
So here ' s a typical situation , male meets female , lots of offspring.
If you put more sterile males out into the environment , then the females are more likely to find a sterile male than a fertile one , and you will bring that population down.
And that ' s exactly where we are.
And then we ' ve gone out into the big outdoors , always with local community consent , always with the necessary permits.
In about four months of release , we ' ve brought that population of mosquitos — in most cases we ' re dealing with villages here of about 2,000 , 3,000 people , that sort of size , starting small — we ' ve taken that mosquito population down by about 85 percent in about four months.
And we ' ve got a production unit in Oxford , or just south of Oxford , where we actually produce these mosquitos.
So freight costs aren ' t our biggest problem.
We ' ve separated the males from the females.
So you take a Google Map , you divide it up , work out how far they can fly , and make sure you ' re releasing such that you get coverage of the area , and then you go back , and within a very short space of time , you ' re bringing that population right the way down.
We have G.M . crops , we have pharmaceuticals , we have new vaccines , all using roughly the same technology , but with very different outcomes.
Both have a side benefit , which is that we reduce pesticide use tremendously.
Where you live : It impacts your health as much as diet and genes do , but it ' s not part of your medical records . At TEDMED , Bill Davenhall shows how overlooked government geo-data can mesh with mobile GPS apps to keep doctors in the loop . Call it  " geo-medicine. " 
Can geographic information make you healthy ? 
And I suddenly realized something : that I was completely in the dark.
So , what I want to do here in the few minutes I have with you is really talk about what is the formula for life and good health.
And you know why I understand that ? 
Do it over and over again . And they ask you questions about your lifestyle and your family history , your medication history , your surgical history , your allergy history .. . did I forget any history ? 
This is my life . These are my life places.
And you realize that you spend it in a variety of different places.
And where do you expose yourselves to risks that maybe perhaps you don ' t even see ?  " 
I started off in Scranton , Pennsylvania.
So then I decided to leave that part of the world , and I was going to go to the mid-west.
Okay , I spent 25 years , in my middle-age lungs now , breathing various concentrations of that.
And I moved to Redlands California.
If you ' ve been there , you know what I ' m talking about.
No doctor , can I remember , ever asking me ,  " Where have you lived ?  " 
This data ' s from all over the world -- countries spend billions of dollars investing in this kind of research.
How many people in the room have spent the majority of their life in the white space ? 
There are thousands of these kinds of maps that are displayed in atlases all over the world.
So , here ' s my friend Paul.
If you really studied that you might have some clues as to what Paul likes to do.
Did you know that data existed ? 
This might be what we end up with.
I ' d suggest that that ' s a bad idea Bill , because of this report. " 
And they ' re in the early stages of development.
But it will also be useful for us.
Just look at that for a minute.
So , I ' d very much like to see us begin to really seize this as an opportunity to get this into our medical records.
How many poets could cram eBay , Friendster and Monster.com into 3-minute poem worthy of a standing ovation ?  Enjoy Rives '  unique talent.
I wrote this poem after hearing a pretty well known actress tell a very well known interviewer on television ,  " I ' m really getting into the Internet lately.

So , for roughly 300 years , the hot debate in architecture was whether the number five or the number seven was a better proportion to think about architecture , because the nose was one-fifth of your head , or because your head was one-seventh of your body.
The best example of this would probably be the Gothic , and the Gothic was invented after the invention of calculus , although the Gothic architects weren ' t really using calculus to define their forms.
The Hanging Chain models of Antonio Gaudi , the Catalan architect.
Interestingly , in the last 10 years Norman Foster used a similar heat thermal transfer model to generate the roof of the National Gallery , with the structural engineer Chris Williams.
My hero is actually not Darwin ; it ' s a guy named William Bateson , father of Greg Bateson , who was here for a long time in Monterey.
Beautiful , because it has symmetry.
So , symmetry wasn ' t the sign of order and organization -- which is what I was always understanding , and as is an architect -- symmetry was the absence of information.
To just talk for a minute about the digital mediums that we ' re using now and how they integrate calculus : the fact that they ' re calculus-based means that we don ' t have to think about dimension in terms of ideal units or discreet elements.
The elements that make up the ceiling grid and the lighting , they ' re all losing their modular quality , and moving more and more to these infinitesimal dimensions.
It ' s just a curve without inflection.
It ' s too early in the morning for a lecture on calculus , so I brought some images to just describe how that works.
Now , the only way we could design that , or possibly construct it , is by using a calculus-based definition of the form.
I think that ' s one of the main changes , also , in architecture : that we ' re starting to look now not for some ideal form , like a Latin cross for a church , but actually all the traits of a church : so , light that comes from behind from an invisible source , directionality that focuses you towards an altar.
In terms of construction and manufacturing , this is a kilometer-long housing block that was built in the  ' 70s in Amsterdam.
So , every one of them is a little bit different-shaped as you move down the length of the building.
But what it gives us is a harmonic and synthesized relationship of all these components , one to another.

So , as manufacturing starts to allow more design options , this problem gets exacerbated , of the whole and the parts.
Basically what we can do , is just cut a graphite mold , put it in an oven , heat it to 1,000 degrees , gently inflate titanium that ' s soft , and then explode it at the last minute into this form.
That way , each one of these tools we could pay for with a few hundred dollars , and get incredible variation in the components.
Like , we have to design things which are coherent as a single object , but also break down into small rooms and have an identity of both the big scale and the small scale.
So a change in the form indicates a change in the color pattern.
In a housing project in Valencia , Spain , we ' re doing , the different towers of housing fused together in shared curves so you get a single mass , like a kind of monolith , but it breaks down into individual elements.
We were one of the finalists for the World Trade Center site design.
And we looked at , from the 1950s on , there were numerous examples of other architects trying to do the same thing.
Finally , I ' d like to just show you some of the effects of using digital fabrication.
So , for these interiors , like this shop in Stockholm , Sweden , or this installation wall in the Netherlands at the Netherlands Architecture Institute , we could use the texture that the tool would leave to produce a lot of the spatial effects , and we could integrate the texture of the wall with the form of the wall with the material.
Evolutionary biologist Paul Ewald drags us into the sewer to discuss germs . Why are some more harmful than others ?  How could we make the harmful ones benign ?  Searching for answers , he examines a disgusting , fascinating case : diarrhea.
What I ' d like to do is just drag us all down into the gutter , and actually all the way down into the sewer because I want to talk about diarrhea.
And I also have a little bit of a sort of smartass subtitle to this.
You actually see a great potential , but you see a lot of people who are sort of defending their turf , and may actually be very resistant , when one tries to introduce ideas.
How can we make the harmful organisms more mild ? 
And that idea is that from the germ ' s-eye point of view , disease organisms have to get from one host to another , and often they have to rely on the well-being of the host to move them to another host.
So , natural selection will favor organisms that are more likely to cause damage.
So , I ' m going to begin by applying this idea to diarrheal diseases.
A person can be sick in bed and still infect tens , even hundreds of other individuals.
The whole point is that a person who can ' t move can still infect many other individuals.
And the answer is -- yep , they are.
Remember the second question that I raised at the outset was , how can we use this knowledge to make disease organisms evolve to be mild ? 
But if it could occur in just a few years , then it might be a very important way to control some of the nasty problems that we haven ' t been able to control.
And that is the species of organism that is responsible for causing cholera.
And it flushes out thousands of different other competitors that would otherwise make life difficult for the Vibrios.
And if you took a drop of that water , you might find a million diarrheal organisms.
Now , I can think of some possible experiments.
There ' s a little ethical problem in this experiment.
And this ethical problem ' s a big problem.
So , we don ' t want to run an experiment like that.
I don ' t think anybody knows , but I ' m not averse to , once that ' s happened , to see whether or not the prediction that we would make , that I did make before , actually holds up.
And so , with funding from the Bosack-Kruger Foundation , I got a lot of strains from these different countries and we measured their toxin production in the lab.
They evolved to produce less toxin.
They didn ' t -- they solved the problem in Chile.
In every case there ' s a lot of variation , but something about the environment the people are living in , and I think the only realistic explanation is that it ' s the degree of waterborne transmission , favored the harmful strains in one place , and mild strains in another.
But there ' s another really interesting aspect of this , and this is that if you could control the evolution of virulence , evolution of harmfulness , then you should be able to control antibiotic resistance.
And once you get increased antibiotic resistance , the antibiotics aren ' t knocking out the harmful strains anymore.
If you could cause an evolutionary decrease in virulence by cleaning up the water supply , you should be able to get an evolutionary decrease in antibiotic resistance.
In this case , on the Y-axis , we ' ve just got a measure of antibiotic sensitivity -- and I won ' t go into that.
And in Chile , you still had antibiotic sensitivity.
And I want to give you just one more example , because we ' ve talked a little bit about malaria.
But I think there ' s a really fascinating example of what one can do experimentally to try to actually demonstrate this.
If you mosquito-proof houses , when people get sick , they ' re sitting in bed -- or in mosquito-proof hospitals , they ' re sitting in a hospital bed -- and the mosquitoes can ' t get to them.
And there ' s a really wonderful experiment that was done that suggests that we really should go ahead and do this.
They had dammed up the Tennessee River.
This shows you the positions of some of these dams.
So they did . They divided Northern Alabama into 11 zones , and within three years , about 100 dollars per house , they mosquito proofed every house.
And so what you can see is that just the mosquito-proofed housing , and nothing else , caused the eradication of malaria.
Now , I would suggest that you could do this in a lot of places.
So to me , it ' s an experiment that ' s waiting to happen , and if it confirms the prediction , then we should have a very powerful tool.
This is a long-term solution.
Because when we ' re dealing with infectious diseases , we ' re dealing with living systems.
So , I don ' t really have time to talk about those things , but I did want to put them up there , just to give you a sense that there really are solutions to controlling the evolution of harmfulness of some of the nasty pathogens that we ' re confronted with.
Will it maybe get lowered if we alter the economy of the area ? 
And that will just add to the effectiveness of our control efforts.
If we know that we ' re going to get extra bang for the buck from providing clean water , then I think that we can say , let ' s push the effort into that aspect of the control , so that we can actually solve the problem , even though , if you just look at the frequency of infection , you would suggest that you can ' t solve the problem well enough just by cleaning up water supply.
design,engineering,invention,medicine,prosthetics,science,technology
It is essentially the stuff of life meets machine.
I mean , the functional impairment is clear.
And actually , I spend as much of my time in clinic dealing with the emotional adjustment of patients as with the physical disability.
And we interact with the physical world with our hands.
Unfortunately , we don ' t do great with upper-limb prosthetics.
It ' s not a lot different than the one you see on my patient.
And we still use them commonly , because they ' re very robust and relatively simple devices.
They work pretty well for people who have just lost their hand , because your hand muscles are still there.
Well how about with higher levels of amputation ? 
Well our patients have to use very code-y systems of using just their arm muscles to operate robotic limbs.
There ' s no other functions.
But at the end of the day , how do we tell these robotic arms what to do ? 
And your sensation ' s the exact opposite.
And if I tap the nerve ending on a World War II vet , he ' ll still feel his missing hand.
And it ' s just too hard to use now and for my patients today.
So our approach is something we call targeted reinnervation.
You think ,  " Bend elbow, "  a different section contracts.
His name is Jesse Sullivan.
And he picks which joint he wants to move with those chin switches.
And that gave us the opportunity to do targeted reinnervation.
And after six months , the nerves grew in well , and you could see strong contractions.
And I challenge anybody in the room to make their chest go like this.
That ' s why it ' s intuitive.
On the right side , two months after we fit him with his targeted reinnervation prosthesis -- which , by the way , is the same physical arm , just programmed a little different -- you can see that he ' s much faster and much smoother as he moves these little blocks.
And after a few months , you touch Jesse on his chest , and he felt his missing hand.
He feels hot , cold , sharp , dull , all in his missing hand , or both his hand and his chest , but he can attend to either.
We ' ve also gone on with what was initially our primary population of people with above-the-elbow amputations.
He ' s about four or five times as fast with this simple little performance metric.
Please welcome Amanda Kitts.
Todd Kuiken : Okay , so after your amputation , you healed up.
So for the simple little things like picking something up , I would have to bend my elbow , and then I would have to cocontract to get it to change modes.
You had to concentrate a whole lot.
AK : It works good.
TK : A little faster ? 
And we now have over 50 patients around the world who have had this surgery , including over a dozen of our wounded warriors in the U.S . armed services.
And it provides intuitive control.
But we want to do better.
So we did some experiments where we saturated our poor patients with zillions of electrodes and then had them try to do two dozen different tasks -- from wiggling a finger to moving a whole arm to reaching for something -- and recorded this data.
But I can ' t put in an electrode and say ,  " Go there. " 
And I have the wrist flexion and extension.
It ' s about seven pounds , which is probably about what my arm would weigh if I lost it right here.
So the exciting part isn ' t so much the mechatronics , but the control.
I had to hook it up to a computer , so I couldn ' t just train it anywhere.
If it stops working for some reason , I can retrain it.
We ' ve also had Amanda able to use some of our more advanced arms that I showed you earlier.
It ' s all the pattern recognition.
Amanda , how many were you able to do with the DEKA arm ? 
TK : That hand ' s not so good for clapping.
Claudia : Oooooh!
So that ' s an exciting laboratory experiment on how to give back , potentially , some skin sensation.
But look at all the electrodes around it.
The future is bright.
And we can have the real estate open to try more sensation feedback.
So it ' ll be the smallest and lightest and the smartest arm ever made.
I ' d like to tell you a little bit about the dark side , with yesterday ' s theme.
And none of those problems could I have dealt with , but I have a really bright research team.
http://www.ted.com/talks/dee_boersma_pay_attention_to_penguins.html
Dee Boersma : Pay attention to penguins
Now there are over 30,000.
It ' s the same problems in the Galapagos , except , obviously , it ' s worse here , in some ways , than other places.
And when I came at age 22 to live on Fernandina , let me just say , that I had never camped before.
But it ' s alive with life ; it ' s hardly uninhabited.
I mean , they can do like seven kilometers an hour and sustain it.
And I doubt anybody in this room could really hold their breath for 3.5 minutes.
They ' re comical , they walk upright , and , of course , they ' re diligent.
They tell us about our world in a lot of different ways , and particularly the ocean.
These are the rarest penguins in the world.
We counted around 2,000 , so I don ' t know how many penguins there really are , but I know I can count 2,000.
We have less than we had before , and most of them are in fairly steep decline.
And you can imagine sleeping on Fernandina your first night there and you hear this lonesome , plaintful call.
This is a cold-water event called La Nina.
When we have extreme El Nino events , you see all this red , and you see no green out here around the Galapagos.
But we didn ' t even know that that affected the Galapagos when I went to study penguins.
But this is a global phenomenon , we know that.
So when I went to study the Magellanic penguins , I didn ' t have any problems.
Fortunately , nobody has harvested any penguins and we ' re getting over 100,000 tourists a year to see them.
And science is important in informing decision makers , and also in changing how we do and knowing the direction of change that we ' re going in.
This is one of the plights of penguins : oil pollution.
So they were just minding their own business.
Why do they do that ?  Because it ' s cheaper , because they don ' t pay the real environmental costs.
We have laws , and we can ' t have illegal dumping ; it ' s against the law. " 
And you can see , in some years over 60 percent of the fledglings were oiled.
Why are there even these penguins oiled ? 
This is climate change . Now this has really been a fun study because I put satellite tags on the back of these Magellanic penguins.
And what the penguins show us -- and these are all the little dots from where the penguins '  positions were for penguins in incubation in 2003 -- and what you see is some of these individuals are going 800 kilometers away from their nests.
Here , you can see in 2006 , they raised almost three quarters of a chick per nest , and you can see that they ' re closer to Punta Tombo ; they ' re not going as far away.
And they ' re going about , on average now , 40 kilometers farther than they did a decade ago.
Lastly I want to say that all of you , probably , have had some relationship at some time in your life with a dog , a cat , some sort of pet , and you recognized that those are individuals.
This is Turbo the Penguin.
And I just wanted to show you what happened one day when Turbo brought in a friend.
This guy has never been in before and he ' s trying to figure out ,  " What is going on ? 
and you see , Turbo ' s pretty intent on his flipper patting.
We ' re also trying to collect our information and become more technologically literate.
You put a little piece of rice in the foot of a penguin that has a barcode , so it tells you who it is.
They ' re all coming in at this time , walking across there , just kind of leisurely coming in.
Look how fat he is . He ' s walking back to feed his chicks.
He unplugs the wire ; we have no data.
So , thank you very much.

I propose to you today that apathy as we think we know it doesn ' t actually exist , but rather , that people do care , but that we live in a world that actively discourages engagement by constantly putting obstacles and barriers in our way.
This is a newspaper ad.
Imagine if the private sector advertised in the same way -- if Nike wanted to sell a pair of shoes and put an ad in the paper like that.
As long as the city ' s putting out notices like this to try to get people engaged , then of course people aren ' t going to be engaged.
Whoever has the most money gets the loudest voice , dominating the visual and mental environment.
And I ' ll give you an example : the Now magazine from last week -- progressive , downtown weekly in Toronto.
A restaurant -- you might not want to just read about it , maybe you want to go to the restaurant.
It talks about the candidates -- written very well -- but no information , no follow-up , no websites for the campaigns , no information about when the debates are , where the campaign offices are.
Heroes : How do we view leadership ? 
Someone came up to them and said ,  " You ' re the chosen one.
A heroic effort is a collective effort , number one.
It ' s voluntary.
Political parties could and should be one of the basic entry points for people to get engaged in politics.
This is a huge problem and a huge obstacle to change because it means that some of the most passionate and informed voices are completely silenced , especially during election time.
Canada ' s currently led by a party that most Canadians didn ' t actually want.
Now I ' m not trying to be negative by throwing all these obstacles out and explaining what ' s in our way.
But we can change all those things I mentioned.
My main message is , if we can redefine apathy , not as some kind of internal syndrome , but as a complex web of cultural barriers that reinforces disengagement , and if we can clearly define , we can clearly identify , what those obstacles are , and then if we can work together collectively to dismantle those obstacles , then anything is possible.

But scientists have for a long time thought this just was never going to be possible.
So that suggests that somewhere in these genes , somewhere in the DNA , are genes for aging , genes that allow them to have different lifespans.
So we ' ve set out to look for genes that control aging.
So we started to change genes at random , looking for long-lived animals.
And it isn ' t until twice as long that they ' re all dead.
And next you ' re going to see the long-lived mutant when it ' s young.
And they can be completely fertile -- have the same number of progeny as the normal worms do.
But everything else is just lying there.
So there ' s something about aging that ' s kind of universal.
This is what ' s really cool : it ' s aging more slowly.
And you meet someone you really like , you get to know her.
You would never know , until she told you.
So what you see in the picture there is a cell with a hormone receptor in red punching through the edge of the cell.
Okay , so what is the daf-2 receptor telling the inside of the cell ? 
It speeds up aging . It makes it go faster.
So what kind of hormones are these ? 
The daf-2 hormone receptor is very similar to the receptor for the hormone insulin and IGF-1.
So these functions were known for these hormones for a long time , but our studies suggested that maybe they had a third function that nobody knew about -- maybe they also affect aging.
If you change this hormone pathway in flies , they live longer.
So maybe it ' s working in people the same way.
And what they found was that people who lived to 90 or 100 were more likely to have daf-2 mutations -- that is , changes in the gene that encodes the receptor for IGF-1.
So the next question , of course , is : Is there any effect on age-related disease ? 
So it ' s really interesting , and it makes sense in a way , that they ' re still young , so why would they be getting diseases of aging until their old ? 
Well it turns out that in the daf-2 mutants , a whole lot of genes are switched on in the DNA that encode proteins that protect the cells and the tissues , and repair damage.
Under those conditions , the FOXO protein in blue has gone into the nucleus -- that little compartment there in the middle of the cell -- and it ' s sitting down on a gene binding to it.
And the genes it turns on includes antioxidant genes , genes I call carrot-giver genes , whose protein products actually help other proteins to function well -- to fold correctly and function correctly.
And many of these different genes , we ' ve shown , actually contribute to the long lifespan of the daf-2 mutant.
So what about the normal worm ? 
But what good is this for the worm ? 
But what we think is that , under conditions of stress , the levels of these hormones drop -- for example , having limited food supply.
So you can think of FOXO as being like a building superintendent.
So he doesn ' t actually do anything himself.
And not only that , it can also just last longer , even if there isn ' t a hurricane.
Just like we all have eyes , but some of us have blue eyes and some of us have brown eyes.
We don ' t know the details of how this works , but we do know then that FOXO genes can impact the lifespan of people.
So we ' ve been trying in our lab now to develop drugs that will activate this FOXO cell using human cells now in order to try and come up with drugs that will delay aging and age-related diseases.
There ' s one called TOR , which is another nutrient sensor , like the insulin pathway.
Now I don ' t want you all to go out taking rapamycin.
But still , here in the year 2011 , there ' s a drug that you can give to mice at a pretty old age that will extend their lifespan , which comes out of this science that ' s been done in all these different animals.
Although you ' re looking for a drug that can solve aging in old men like me , what you could do now pretty well in the lab , if you were allowed ethically , is start a human life from scratch with altered genes that would make it live for a lot longer ? 
There isn ' t the technology to do that.
So it might be that you would just have to fine tune it very carefully to get the benefits without getting any problems.
There ' s a phenomenon which you have written about and spoken about , which is a negligible senescence.
For example , there are some tortoises called Blanding ' s turtles.
And the 70 year-old ones , actually they ' re better at scouting out the good nesting places , and they also have more progeny every year.
If you look at birds , which live a long time , cells from the birds tend to be more resistant to a lot of different environmental stresses like high temperature or hydrogen peroxide , things like that.
And maybe they ' re even set really differently in animals with no senescence at all -- but we don ' t know.
You notice that you ' re getting old , and you look at your human and you think ,  " Why isn ' t this human getting old ?  " 
MR : Thank you very much indeed , Cynthia Kenyon.

I returned to Singapore and , in 1990 , performed Asia ' s first successful cadaveric liver transplant procedure , but against all odds.
But 20 years on , my patient , Surinder , is Asia ' s longest surviving cadaveric liver transplant to date.
As the demand for donor organs continues to rise , in large part due to the aging population , the supply has remained relatively constant.
But as there was still a dire shortage of donor organs , the gift of life was then extended from living , related donors to now living , unrelated donors.
In my part of the world , too many people live below the poverty line.
Pregnancies are meant to be happy and fulfilling moments in any woman ' s life.
No doubt , I was informed , the consent had been obtained.
I was troubled that the retrieval of organs from executed prisoners was at least as morally controversial as the harvesting of stem cells from human embryos.
And in transplantation , concepts shifted from whole organs to cells.
I thought to myself , why not take the individual cells out of the pancreas -- the cells that secrete insulin to cure diabetes -- and transplant these cells ?  -- technically a much simpler procedure than having to grapple with the complexities of transplanting a whole organ.
And I focused my research on stem cells as a possible source for cell transplants.
Now to the ridicule of my colleagues , I inspired my lab to focus on what I thought was the most non-controversial source of stem cells , adipose tissue , or fat , yes fat -- nowadays available in abundant supply -- you and I , I think , would be very happy to get rid of anyway.
But adult stem cells are not embryonic stem cells.
And so guess what , scientists around the world and in the labs are racing to convert aging adult cells -- aging adult cells from you and me -- they are racing to reprogram these cells back into more useful IPS cells.
Heart disease , stroke , diabetes , spinal cord injury , muscular dystrophy , retinal eye diseases -- are any of these conditions relevant , personally , to you ? 
And I started to see floaters and stars , which I casually dismissed as too much high-altitude sun exposure.
37 million people worldwide are blind , and 127 million more suffer from impaired vision.
It is a fact that when our organs or tissues are injured , our bone marrow releases stem cells into our circulation.
What lies ahead ? 
Stem cells may be used to deliver growth factors to repair damaged heart muscle or be differentiated into heart muscle cells to restore heart function.
Stem cell therapies may one day reduce the need for donor organs.
The research success that we celebrate today has been made possible by the curiosity and contribution and commitment of individual scientists and medical pioneers.
The Teresa Carreño Youth Orchestra contains the best high school musicians from Venezuela ' s life-changing music program , El Sistema . Led here by Gustavo Dudamel , they play Shostakovich ' s Symphony No . 10 , 2nd movement , and Arturo Márquez '  Danzón No . 2.
Chris Anderson : And now we go live to Caracas to see one of Maestro Abreu ' s great proteges.
Gustavo Dudamel : Hi everybody in L.A.
We are very happy because we have the opportunity to have this angel in the world -- not only in our country , Venezuela , but in our world.
And we want to play a little piece for you by one of the most important composers of America.
In the quest to map the brain , many scientists have attempted the incredibly daunting task of recording the activity of each neuron . Gero Miesenboeck works backward -- manipulating specific neurons to figure out exactly what they do , through a series of stunning experiments that reengineer the way fruit flies percieve light.
I have a doppelganger.
But in contrast to my evil twin who lusts after world domination , my motives are not sinister.
Many neuroscientists agree with this view and think that understanding will come from more detailed observation and analysis.
Take a look at what brain activity might look like.
So you ' re looking at roughly one percent of the brain of a cockroach.
We don ' t understand the code used by the brain.
So in this situation too , to decode the information contained in patterns like this , watching alone won ' t do.
The more targeted our interventions , the better.
Now , I ' m by no means the first person to realize how powerful a tool intervention is.
This experiment revealed the first , and perhaps most fundamental , nugget of the neural code : that information is written in the form of electrical impulses.
So around the turn of the last century , I started to think ,  " Wouldn ' t it be wonderful if one could take this logic and turn it upside down ?  " 
And second , just as in a radio broadcast , you can communicate with many receivers at once.
I hope you ' ll appreciate the beautiful simplicity of this concept.
Pores like these conduct electrical current and are responsible for all the communication in the nervous system.
Because the light-activated pore is encoded in DNA , we can achieve incredible precision.
The approach works so well that we can write purely artificial messages directly to the brain.
It was done six or seven years ago by my then graduate student , Susana Lima.
And you can see here that the flash of light has exactly the same effect.
These headless bodies can live for about a day , but they don ' t do much.
They didn ' t get very far , obviously.
We can now actually interfere with their psychology in rather profound ways , as I ' ll show you in my last example , which is directed at a familiar question.
Our actions change the environment , or context , and these changes are then fed back into the decision loop.
Here ' s some such CCTV footage.
Now for an intelligent being like our fly , this policy is not written in stone but rather changes as the animal learns from experience.
So we set out to identify the cells in the fly ' s brain that played the role of the Critic.
So we bred flies whose brains were more or less randomly peppered with cells that were light addressable.
The fly should learn to avoid the optically reinforced odor.
Optically activating these hundred or so cells into two strains of flies has dramatically different consequences.
Whenever it comes up to the midpoint , it pauses , it carefully scans the odor interface as if it was sniffing out its environment , and then it turns around.
These 12 cells , as shown here in green , send the output to a brain structure called the  " mushroom body, "  which is shown here in gray.
In fact , it makes so much sense that we can construct an electronic toy circuit that simulates the behavior of the fly.
So the pilot in the cockpit of the fly , the Actor , can tell which odor is present simply by looking at which of the blue LEDs lights up.
Now consider a situation in which the motors stay off , the fly continues on its path and it suffers some painful consequence such as getting zapped.
So the next time the fly finds itself facing the same odor again , the connection is strong enough to turn on the motors and to trigger an evasive maneuver.
In the experiments I told you about , we have lifted the identity of the Critic , but we still have no idea how the Critic does its job.
http://www.ted.com/talks/robert_full_learning_from_the_gecko_s_tail.html
Robert Full : Learning from the gecko ' s tail
I define that as an association between biology and another discipline , where each discipline reciprocally advances the other , but where the collective discoveries that emerge are beyond any single field.
These are gecko toes.
They don ' t stick by Velcro or suction or glue.
And so has my other incredible collaborator , Mark Cutkosky , at Stanford -- he made much larger hairs than the gecko , but used the same general principles.
Man : This the first time someone has actually climbed with it.
Lynn Verinsky : Because of liability insurance.
Lynn Verinsky : Ha! Wow . And what a privilege that has been.
Now the problem with the robots doing this is that they can ' t get unstuck , with the material.
And here is what it does.
And now it can go on other surfaces because of the new adhesive that the Stanford group was able to do in designing this incredible robot.
The engineers told us , for the climbing robots , that , if they don ' t have a tail , they fall off the wall.
 " Do animals use their tails when they climb up walls ?  " 
Well we know that tails store fat , for example.
So watch this kangaroo.
Now mostly tails limit maneuverability , like this human inside this dinosaur suit.
And when I went back to research this , I realized that one of the great TED moments in the past , from Nathan , we ' ve talked about an active tail.
Pretty powerful.
And watch on the right what the animal is doing with its tail when it slips . This is slowed down 10 times.
If you make it slip a huge amount , this is what we discovered.
They ' re climbing up a wall , or a tree.
And this is what we discovered.
For those of you who remember your physics , that ' s a zero-angular-momentum righting response . But it ' s like a cat.
So they do it with this active tail as they swing around.
And we ' re going to attempt the first air-righting response in a tail , with a robot.
There it is.
We ' ll blow the air up , we ' ll give it a landing target , a tree trunk , just outside the plexi-glass enclosure , and see what it does.
This is sort of incredible . But actually it ' s quite beautiful , when you take a picture of it.
And then -- we had to film this several times to believe this -- it also does this . Watch this.
What does that mean for the origin of flapping flight ? 
So there is the landing target . Could they steer towards it with these capabilities ?  Here it is in the wind tunnel.
Definitely moving towards the landing target.
So we went ,  " Oh my god , we have to go to the field , and see if it actually does this. " 
And the next video you see is the first time we ' ve showed this.
So there it comes down . There is a gecko at the end of that trajectory line.
So now we can continue this mutualism by suggesting that they can make an active tail.
And of course you need the organisms and the environment to do it.
Jehane Noujaim unveils her 2006 TED Prize wish : to bring the world together for one day a year through the power of film.
I can ' t help but with this wish to think about when you ' re a little kid and you -- all your friends ask you if a genie could give you one wish in the world , what would it be ? 
So let ' s get to what I would like , which is world peace.
But I really do think it makes sense , and I think that the first step to world peace is for people to meet each other.
That ' s great . That ' s great.
This is Donna.
And this is Donna teaching my aunt how to do a Filipino dance.
You can ' t force people of free will , and I totally support that.
I was asked that I speak a little bit about where I personally come from , and Cameron , I don ' t know how you managed to get out of that one , but I think that building bridges is important to me because of where I come from.
And I ' ve also been called -- as an Egyptian-Lebanese-Syrian American with a Persian name -- the  " Middle East Peace Crisis. " 
There was a center there where they were teaching people how to read and write and get vaccinations against the many diseases you can get from sorting through garbage.
I got drawn into this community and I began to take pictures there.
It was my first exhibit of photographs and they were all put up there , and after about two days , they all came down except for three.
But I was looking at this intense emotion and intense feeling that had come out of people just seeing these photographs.
And I think the most important reaction that I saw there was actually people that would never have gone to the garbage village themselves , that would never have seen that the human spirit could thrive in such difficult circumstances.
And I was watching television in New York and there seemed to be just one point of view that was coming across , and the coverage went from the U.S . State Department to embedded troops and what was coming across on the news was that there was going to be this clean war and precision bombings , and the Iraqis would be greeting the Americans as liberators and throwing flowers at their feet in the streets of Baghdad.
So I knew that I had to go there.
I had somebody bring it there because I wanted to get access to Al Jazeera , George Bush ' s favorite channel and a place which I was very curious about because it ' s disliked by many governments across the Arab world and also called the mouthpiece of Osama Bin Laden by some people in the U.S . government.
And when I went there and sat there , and met these people that were in the center of it and sat with these characters , I met some surprising , very complex people.
But between us , if I ' m offered a job with Fox , I ' ll take it.
But I have plans for my children.
Josh Rushing : The night they showed the POWs and the dead soldiers -- Al Jazeera showed them -- it was powerful because America doesn ' t show those kinds of images.
It made me sick to my stomach.
That ' s bad. " 
And it upset me on a profound level that I wasn ' t bothered as much the night before.
We had no funding for it.
I mean , Josh Rushing was this incredibly complex person who was thinking about things.
Al Jazeera offered him a job.
And I saw this with audiences.
Now , I don ' t know whether a film can change the world , but I know that it starts -- I know the power of it -- I know that it starts people thinking about how to change the world.
And these couple clips take you inside of two of the most difficult conflicts that we are faced with today.
Man : If we had airplanes , we wouldn ' t need martyrs , that ' s the difference.
Woman : There is no Paradise! It only exists in your head!
Anyway , I ' d rather have Paradise in my head than live in this hell!
Will we win that way ? 
Woman : Perhaps . We have to turn it into a moral war.
Ayelet : What do you know about the casualties ? 
Zvika : I said ,  " OK , that ' s Bat-Chen , that ' s my daughter.
When we got to here , we saw three Israeli military jeeps parked on the side of the road.
George : But there is a teacher that is in charge ? 
But after thinking logically about it , I didn ' t find any reason why not to meet them and let them know of our suffering.
Man : Song is something that we communicated with people who otherwise would not have understood where we ' re coming from.
Death unto apartheid! " 
Yes . Yes!
I ' ve been listening to the talks in some of the conference , and Robert Wright said yesterday that if we have an appreciation for another person ' s humanity , then they will have an appreciation for ours.
And that ' s an amazing thing.
There ' s Just Vision , that are working with Palestinians and Israelis who are working together for peace , and documenting that process and getting interviews out there and using this film to take to Congress to show that it ' s a powerful tool to show that this is a woman who ' s had her daughter killed in an attack , and she believes that there are peaceful ways to solve this.
I ' d like for us to imagine for a second -- imagine a day when you have everyone coming together from around the world.
This amazing power can be used to change people and to bond people together , to cross borders and have people feel like they ' re having a communal experience.
It ' s endless what you can imagine , in terms of where you can project films and where you can have this communal experience.
So we ' ve already made a partnership actually , set up through somebody from the TED community , John Camen , introduced me to Steven Apkon , from the Jacob Burns Film Center.
Now , we ' ve thought about a name for this day and I ' d like to share this with you.
And we called that landmass Pangea.
And I know that there are independent filmmakers and films out there that can really make this happen.
Pangea Cinema -- the day the world comes together.

Brian Greene on string theory
Now , when someone makes a bold and bizarre idea , sometimes that ' s all it is -- bold and bizarre , but it has nothing to do with the world around us.
To begin we need a little bit of back story . Go to 1907.
All of that could be described using Newton ' s work.
And that is a task to which Einstein set himself -- to figure out how gravity works.
Einstein said space is nice and flat , if there ' s no matter present.
Now look at the Moon.
That is this new idea about how gravity actually works.
And that is what got Kaluza thinking.
Maybe I can play the same game with the other known force , which was , at that time , known as the electromagnetic force -- we know of others today , but at that time that was the only other one people were thinking about.
Einstein had already used up space and time , warps and curves , to describe gravity.
So he imagined that the world had four dimensions of space , not three , and imagined that electromagnetism was warps and curves in that fourth dimension . Now here ' s the thing : when he wrote down the equations describing warps and curves in a universe with four space dimensions , not three , he found the old equations that Einstein had already derived in three dimensions -- those were for gravity -- but he found one more equation because of the one more dimension.
Now clearly , Kaluza was a man who took theory very seriously.
Number one : if there are more dimensions in space , where are they ? 
He suggested that dimensions might come in two varieties -- there might be big , easy-to-see dimensions , but there might also be tiny , curled-up dimensions , curled up so small , even though they ' re all around us , that we don ' t see them.
It ' s very hard to see it , though , from far away.
But this illustrates the fact that dimensions can be of two sorts : big and small . And the idea that maybe the big dimensions around us are the ones that we can easily see , but there might be additional dimensions curled up , sort of like the circular part of that cable , so small that they have so far remained invisible.
But if you were a little ultra microscopic ant walking around , you could walk in the big dimensions that we all know about -- that ' s like the grid part -- but you could also access the tiny curled-up dimension that ' s so small that we can ' t see it with the naked eye or even with any of our most refined equipment.
Well , it turns out that Einstein and Kaluza and many others worked on trying to refine this framework and apply it to the physics of the universe as was understood at the time , and , in detail , it didn ' t work.
In our era , a new approach to unify the laws of physics is being pursued by physicists such as myself , many others around the world , it ' s called superstring theory , as you were indicating.
Well , it ' s a theory that tries to answer the question : what are the basic , fundamental , indivisible , uncuttable constituents making up everything in the world around us ? 
So deep inside -- we all know , you go sufficiently far down , you have atoms.
That is where conventional ideas stop.
It looks like a vibrating string -- that ' s where the idea , string theory comes from.
So if these ideas are correct , this is what the ultra-microscopic landscape of the universe looks like.
And there you see unification , because matter particles , electrons and quarks , radiation particles , photons , gravitons , are all built up from one entity.
When you study the mathematics of string theory , you find that it doesn ' t work in a universe that just has three dimensions of space.
Now you might think about that and say , well , OK , you know , if you have extra dimensions , and they ' re really tightly curled up , yeah , perhaps we won ' t see them , if they ' re small enough.
In the remaining time , I ' d like to tell you two features of them.
Now , does string theory offer an answer ? 
This is a deep question.
Let me show you how.
This is an example of something known as a Calabi-Yau shape -- name isn ' t all that important.
So what is the physical implication , though , relevant to those 20 numbers ? 
So let me bring some strings into the story.
And if the answer that we get from our calculations agrees with the values of those numbers that have been determined through detailed and precise experimentation , this in many ways would be the first fundamental explanation for why the structure of the universe is the way it is.
Here ' s how it goes . In CERN , Geneva , Switzerland , a machine is being built called the Large Hadron Collider.
How would we know it ? 
So , imagine we have a certain kind of particle called a graviton -- that ' s the kind of debris we expect to be ejected out , if the extra dimensions are real.
So this is the kind of experiment that we ' ll be looking at in the next five , seven to 10 years or so.
And now string theory comes along and says , yes , gravity , quantum mechanics , electromagnetism , all together in one package , but only if the universe has more dimensions than the ones that we see.
Rob Dunbar hunts for data on our climate from 12,000 years ago , finding clues inside ancient seabeds and corals and inside ice sheets . His work is vital in setting baselines for fixing our current climate -- and in tracking the rise of deadly ocean acidification.
We can ' t solve the problems unless we start studying the ocean in a very much more interdisciplinary way.
And then the last thing on the list there , ocean acidification -- if you were to ask me , you know ,  " What do you worry about the most ? 
So I will spend a little time at the end.
It really wasn ' t on the radar screen.
One of the problems is coming up with the right target.
But there ' s not a lot of science behind that number.
Most of the science that is behind these numbers , these potential targets , is based on studies on land.
We are , right now , at 390 parts per million of CO2 in the atmosphere.
Well , the problem is that we ' ve got very complicated forces in the climate system.
But the entire planet warms up when there ' s a big El Nino.
So anything that influences how ocean surface waters mix with the deep water changes the ocean of the planet.
We ' re changing the characteristics of the surface of the land , the reflectivity.
But to answer that question , to make a clear attribution to carbon dioxide , you have to know something about all of these other agents of change.
Now , we have many ways to study natural variability.
We go out for months at a time and drill into the sea bed to recover sediments that tell us stories of climate change , right.
It looks downright tropical there.
and winds averaging about 40 knots for most of the voyage and up to 70 or 80 knots.
And we made the very first bore hole through the largest floating ice shelf on the planet.
So , this huge floating ice shelf the size of Alaska comes from West Antarctica.
Because it ' s partly floating , you can imagine , is sea level rises a little bit , the ice lifts off the bed , and then it can break off and float north.
We drilled through a hundred meters of floating ice shelf then through 900 meters of water and then 1,300 meters into the sea floor.
Now , there ' s 40 scientists working on this project , and people are doing all kinds of really complicated and expensive analyses.
That ' s the kind of material in the deep sea.
This is absolutely beautiful stuff.
So what that means is , what it tells us is that the Ross Sea region , this ice shelf , melted back and formed anew about 35 times.
In fact , the lore for many years has been ,  " The ice formed many tens of millions of years ago , and it ' s been there ever since. " 
But here ' s the key thing : you know , the other thing we found out is that the ice sheet passed a threshold , that the planet warmed up enough -- and the number ' s about one degree to one and a half degrees Centigrade -- the planet warmed up enough that it became ...
So many of us are convinced now that West Antarctica , the West Antarctic Ice Sheet , is starting to melt.
Okay , the second story takes place here in Galapagos.
And it ' s covered with algae . That ' s what happens.
So one of the things thought of in the  ' 80s was to go back and take cores of coral heads throughout the Galapagos and find out how often was there a devastating event.
We saw no other mass mortality events.
Here ' s how we sample the corals.
Now , Sylvia Earle turned me on to this exact same coral.
We ' re not killing the colony ; we ' re taking a small core sample out of the top.
So we ' ve done that all over the Eastern Pacific.
That the place where , during an earthquake in 1954 , this marine terrace was lifted up out of the ocean very quickly , and it was lifted up about six to seven meters.
Imagine that.
Each one of those is a year.
We can analyze the carbonate that makes up the coral , and there ' s a whole bunch of things we can do.
Then after we harvest a coral , we measure this ratio , and now you can see , those curves match perfectly.
So , what we do : we ' ve merged a lot of different data sets.
There ' s a whole family of curves here.
We work with tree rings.
You can see there ' s some signals there.
Some of them are from the northern hemisphere ; some are from the entire globe.
A century-scale , decadal-scale variability , and we know the magnitude ; it ' s about two-tenths to four-tenths of a degree Centigrade.
You know , that ' s the strength of our argument , that we are doing something that ' s truly different.
Right now , about a third of that carbon dioxide is dissolving straight into the sea , right ? 
It has many consequences.
That material is more soluble in acidic fluid.
But it ' s not just the carbonate producers that are affected.
You know , these are things that we have good physiological reasons to expect to see stressed caused by this transience.
And here ' s the thing : you have to go back about 15 million years to find a time when CO2 levels were about what they are today.
So , Charlie Veron came up with this statement last year :  " The prospect of ocean acidification may well be the most serious of all of the predicted outcomes of anthropogenic CO2 release. " 
Beau Lotto ' s color games puzzle your vision , but they also spotlight what you can ' t normally see : how your brain works . This fun , first-hand look at your own versatile sense of sight reveals how evolution tints your perception of what ' s really out there.
I want to start with a game.
And you have to tell me which one.
How many people think it ' s the green one ? 
Here is the orange one.
So , this is pretty amazing , actually , isn ' t it ? 
What I want to talk about is not that context is everything , but why is context everything.
What you see here is a jungle scene , and you see the surfaces according to the amount of light that those surfaces reflect.
Now , let ' s see the surfaces according to the quality of light that they reflect.
Why ?  Because , as Berkeley tells us , we have no direct access to our physical world , other than through our senses.
So let me show you what I mean . Imagine that this is the back of your eye.
They are the same , as far as your eye is concerned.
Completely different meanings , giving rise to the exact same retinal information.
And what ' s true for sensory information is true for information generally.
So , the brain evolved the mechanisms for finding patterns , finding relationships in information and associating those relationships with a behavioral meaning , a significance , by interacting with the world.
 " You are not reading this. " 
But you put one there . Why ? 
So you don ' t do it again.
One is simply the flipping of the other . Okay ? 
But I really want you to learn.
Now , when I tell you , I want you to look at the dot between the two desert scenes.
Why ?  Because your brain is seeing that same information as if the right one is still under red light , and the left one is still under green light.
And now the one on the dark surround looks lighter than the one on the light surround.
We have two identical tiles , on the left , one in a dark surround , one in a light surround.
And see what happens to your perception.
Why ?  Because if the tile in that shadow were in fact in shadow , and reflecting the same amount of light to your eye as the one outside the shadow , it would have to be more reflective -- just the laws of physics.
So you see it that way.
That is your perceptual reality . The physical reality is that those two tiles are the same.
The seven yellow tiles on the right are also gray.
So here we have -- let ' s turn this around -- a diamond.
Move your eyes around , blink , maybe close one eye.
So I can ask you , which direction is it rotating ? 
Are we the only ones that see illusions ? 
Because we can completely control their experience , and see how that alters the architecture of their brain.
And you ' ll see one of the bees come out here.
We pull them out , put them in the fridge , and they fall asleep.
Now she is drinking a glass of water that ' s about that big to you and I , will do that about three times , and then fly.
And she ' ll come into the hive , find an empty honey pot and throw up , and that ' s honey.
Now , are they getting it wrong ? 
So , illusions are often used , especially in art , in the words of a more contemporary artist ,  " to demonstrate the fragility of our senses. " 
We can ' t . Instead , the brain evolved to see the world the way it was useful to see in the past.
And they can navigate the world using their ears.
That line is broken up into 32 squares.
He finds it . Amazing . Right ? 
And then we translated these images.
So , a six-year-old child . Okay ? 
We ' re defined by our environment and our interaction with that environment -- by our ecology.
Because I think only through uncertainty is there potential for understanding.
So , now , what I want to do : I ' m going to put the middle nine surfaces here under yellow illumination by simply putting a filter behind them.
I ' m going to put the middle nine under a purplish light.
Let ' s pull the covers off.
And I ' ll leave you with that.
culture,global issues,security,technology
And they ' re different.
And what I want to do in this talk is to split them apart -- figuring out when they diverge and how they converge.
Every time you get some security , you ' re always trading off something.
That might be true , but it ' s not terribly relevant.
Now there ' s often no right or wrong here.
A lot of times , these trade-offs are about more than just security , and I think that ' s really important.
We often won ' t even notice them.
That rabbit will make a security trade-off :  " Should I stay , or should I flee ?  " 
And I think that ' s a fundamentally interesting question.
Most of the time , feeling and reality are the same.
2010 New York , not so much.
So I ' ll give you four.
This is for children.
If a risk is thrust upon you -- terrorism was a good example -- you ' ll overplay it because you don ' t feel like it ' s in your control.
If you hear a lot about tiger attacks , there must be a lot of tigers around.
I tell people , if it ' s in the news , don ' t worry about it.
We respond to stories more than data.
One mango , two mangoes , three mangoes , 10,000 mangoes , 100,000 mangoes -- it ' s still more mangoes you can eat before they rot.
And what these cognitive biases do is they act as filters between us and reality.
Or the other way , and that ' s a false sense of insecurity.
So back to economics.
Or two , you can make people just feel secure and hope they don ' t notice.
Enough real world examples helps.
Well , a poor understanding.
If , for example , terrorism almost never happens , it ' s really hard to judge the efficacy of counter-terrorist measures.
So let me complicate things.
It doesn ' t change ; it ' s real.
In a primitive and simple world , there ' s really no reason for a model because feeling is close to reality.
You need a model to understand them.
It ' s limited by our cognitive biases.
A couple years ago , I was in South Africa on safari.
I would have died in a day , but he was born there , and he understood how to survive.
Models can come from the media , from our elected officials.
A lot of models come from science.
So models can change.
I mean , there were people who were afraid to push doorbells , because there was electricity in there , and that was dangerous.
It hasn ' t changed as we were growing up.
Intuitive is just another word for familiar.
Now it had a name , which made it scarier than the regular flu , even though it was more deadly.
As the novelty wore off , the months went by , there was some amount of tolerance , people got used to it.
And when the vaccine appeared last winter , there were a lot of people -- a surprising number -- who refused to get it -- as a nice example of how people ' s feelings of security change , how their model changes , sort of wildly with no new information , with no new input.
I have a very relativistic view of security.
And I call that their agenda.
In the history of the past 50 years , the smoking risk shows how a model changes , and it also shows how an industry fights against a model it doesn ' t like.
Nowadays , no kid will let you drive if you ' re not wearing a seat belt.
Models are hard to dislodge.
It has to get very compelling before we ' ll pay attention.
We can do to the next harvest.
We can have both models in our head simultaneously , right , that kind of problem where we ' re holding both beliefs together , right , the cognitive dissonance.
Also , personal experiences with crime can do it , personal health scare , a health scare in the news.
And we rely on others . We rely on proxies.
I didn ' t check the airplane.
And that ' s okay.
It ' s manipulation , but it can work.
Some of this stuff is hard.
We live in a technological world ; reality changes all the time.
And I want to close with two quick stories to illustrate this.
This terrified people.
Those tamper-proof caps , that came from this.
But it made people feel better.
It turns out when a baby ' s born now , they put an RFID bracelet on the baby , put a corresponding one on the mother , so if anyone other than the mother takes the baby out of the maternity ward , an alarm goes off.
It basically never happens.
What ' s important is that they be about the same.

Let me try to convince you of that in a few seconds.
All these things , they come back to plants.
And they are also under threat because they are sharing a planet with people like us.
So if all human life depends on plants , doesn ' t it make sense that perhaps we should try to save them ? 
Because seeds , in all their diverse glory , are plants '  futures.
And it ' s the largest seed bank in the world.
So if you ' re going to build a seed bank , you have to decide what you ' re going to store in it . Right ? 
It means negotiating with heads of state , and with secretaries of state in 50 countries to sign treaties.
They search for them . They find them in flower.
You kind of shovel them all in to bags and dry them off.
And these seeds will be able to germinate , we believe , with many of the species , in thousands of years , and certainly in hundreds of years.
So all around the world people are doing the same thing.
And then we grow these things , and we tell people , back in the countries where these seeds have come from ,  " Look , actually we ' re not just storing this to get the seeds later , but we can give you this information about how to germinate these difficult plants. " 
Ten percent of all plant species on the planet , 24,000 species are safe ; 30,000 species , if we get the funding , by next year.
We have thousands of collections that have been sent out all over the world : drought-tolerant forest species sent to Pakistan and Egypt ; especially photosynthetic-efficient plants come here to the United States ; salt-tolerant pasture species sent to Australia ; the list goes on and on.
The one where the guy is collecting seeds there on the truck , that is down to about 30 last remaining trees.
2,800 dollars per species is the average.
And we ' re almost there.

Psychology professor took kids that were four years old and put them in a room all by themselves.
Exact equivalent.
Five seconds , 10 seconds , 40 seconds , 50 seconds , two minutes , four minutes , eight minutes.
Would look at it.
Self-discipline : the most important factor for success.
And they found that 100 percent of the children that had not eaten the marshmallow were successful.
They were doing fine.
A few were still there with bad grades.
And it was very funny . I used four , five and six years old kids.
This little girl was interesting ; she ate the inside of the marshmallow.
She should not go into banking , for example , or work at a cash register.
That person ate the marshmallow.
So this has applications in all walks of life.
They are teaching these kids exactly this principle.
New York was planning to tear down the High Line , an abandoned elevated railroad in Manhattan , when Robert Hammond and a few friends suggested : Why not make it a park ?  He shares how it happened in this tale of local cultural activism.
The Highline is an old , elevated rail line that runs for a mile and a half right through Manhattan.
So they elevated it.
It was a train loaded with frozen turkeys -- they say , at Thanksgiving -- from the meatpacking district.
I went to my first community board meeting -- which I ' d never been to one before -- and sat next to another guy named Joshua David , who ' s a travel writer.
And what first attracted me , or interested me , was this view from the street -- which is this steel structure , sort of rusty , this industrial relic.
Mayor Giuliani wanted to tear it down.
So we commissioned an economic feasibility study to try to make the case.
And the main case was , this is going to make good economic sense for the city.
Now people estimate it ' s created about a half a billion dollars , or will create about a half a billion dollars , in tax revenues for the city.
We opened the fist section in 2009.
It ' s this amphitheater right over 10th Ave.
And the Whitney is moving downtown and is building their new museum right at the base of the High Line.
This is one of my favorite features , this flyover where you ' re eight feet off the surface of the High Line , running through a canopy of trees.
And the city has planned -- for better or for worse -- 12 million square-feet of development that the High Line is going to ring around.
Just one quick example is I realized right after we opened that there were all these people holding hands on the High Line.
In politics , it seems counterintuitive to engage in dialogue with violent groups , with radicals and terrorists , and with the states that support them . But Jonas Gahr Støre , the foreign minister of Norway , makes a compelling case for open discussion , even when values diverge , in an attempt to build greater security for all.
Amongst all the troubling deficits we struggle with today -- we think of financial and economic primarily -- the ones that concern me most is the deficit of political dialogue -- our ability to address modern conflicts as they are , to go to the source of what they ' re all about and to understand the key players and to deal with them.
But the picture is changing , and we are seeing that there are new key players coming onto the scene.
The rules of engagement : how to talk , when to talk , and how to deal with them.
These are quite different , and they are outside the grasp of modern diplomacy.
Another acknowledgment we ' ve seen during these years , recent years , is that very few of these domestic interstate , intrastate conflicts can be solved militarily.
And we have among states a reluctance in dealing with them.
And groups are very often immediately label terrorists.
Now I ' m not naive.
I happen to believe that Libya was necessary and that military intervention in Afghanistan was also necessary.
10 years after that military intervention , that country is far from secure.
And he told me that ,  " This can be won militarily , minister.
We can only solve this through a political solution.
Everybody seems to agree with that.
Because we didn ' t talk.
My point is that you don ' t have to be neutral to talk.
And the other side which you ' re going to engage is the one with whom you profoundly disagree.
This is Tahrir Square.
And who knows what it will be called in the end.
And we find out in the West that we know very little about what ' s happening.
Right now , the discussion goes ,  " Should we talk to the Muslim Brotherhood ? 
If you talk in the right way , you make it very clear that talking is not agreeing.
How will we ever be interlocutors ? 
Now talking can be accompanied with aid or not with aid.
We will make the road from violent activities into politics harder to travel.
And the reason is what happened in South Africa : Nelson Mandela.
Now as you know , Mandela didn ' t do that.
Now South African friends will know that was very painful.
We have to connect with these profound changes.
We need a lot more training on how to do that and a lot more practice on how that can take problem-solving forward.
But that strategy seldom takes you very far.
We could never have done the convention against anti-personnel landmines and the convention that is banning cluster munitions unless we had done diplomacy differently , by engaging with civil society.
This is perhaps a first element of a change.
It is going to demand an inclusive process of diplomacy very different from the one we are practicing today as we are heading to new rounds of difficult climate negotiations , but when we move toward something which has to be much more along a broad mobilization.
What is the legitimacy of diplomacy , of the the solution we devise as diplomats if they cannot be reflected and understood by also these broader forces of societies that we now very loosely call groups ? 
But the problem is that we are coming out of a decade where we had a fear of touching it.
In my country , I have seen how the council of Islamist groups and Christian groups came together , not as a government initiative , but they came together on their own initiative to establish contact and dialogue in times where things were pretty low-key tension.
So there are many reasons , and for all of these reasons , this is time and this is why we must talk.

She says ,  " Oh , that ' s beautiful.
And , you know ,  " Excuse me! " 
This is a Gentoo penguin . And she was still skeptical.
Wha -- what do you do ?  " 
And it ' s very hard for me to make sense of it , so I ' m not sure that you can.
I ' m not sure what these people think , because I don ' t speak Norsk.
Because archaeology gives us an opportunity to study past civilizations , and see where they succeeded and where they failed.
They made , so far as we can tell , 900 of them.
And somewhere along the line , somebody said ,  " I know! Let ' s cut down the last tree and commit suicide , because we need more identical statues. " 
And then I met Yoyo , who is the native Rapa Nui-an guide , and if you look at Yoyo ' s face , you kind of figure out where they got it.
She ' s the leading archaeologist working Easter Island today.
So , this used to be completely smooth.
Second , we have these ideas about how you can algorithmically , then , learn a few of the mysteries about them.
I also have an archaeological project going on in Egypt.
But there ' s some amazing opportunities in Egypt as well.
This is the conventional nuclear fuel cycle.
It ' s got the huge advantage that it does not create carbon pollution.
There ' s -- no reactor ' s been even built to an old design , much less a new one , in the United States for 25 years.
So , this device here is an invisibility cloak.
The cool thing is , this does it from all angles.
But some day , some day , maybe it ' s going to work.
And these happen to be my eyes , by the way.
I ' ve been on a team that won the world championship of barbecue.
So , this is my latest cooker , and if this looks more complicated than the nuclear reactor , that ' s because it is.
This subjects food to a force about 50,000 times that of normal gravity , and oh boy , does it clarify chicken stock.
Theory is red , black is experiment.
It turns out there are real people who go out and search for extraterrestrials in a very scientific way.
She is risking her professional life on something that her own calculations show may not work for a thousand years -- may not ever.
I said ,  " Oh , yeah , yeah -- absolutely. " 
I said ,  " Well , you know , it ' s just a movie! Come on. " 
So , I do a lot of work on dinosaurs.
Now , to find dinosaurs , you hike around in horrible conditions looking for a dinosaur.
You know , skiers pray for snow ? 
Now , this is something I found , so look at it very closely here.
And then when you look at this , you say ,  " That ' s a tooth.
This is what Tyrannosaurus rex looks like in the ground.
You know.
The study of dinosaurs may , literally , one day save the planet.
This is actually what most dinosaur research looks like.
I travel all over the world taking pictures -- some of them good , most of them not.
I ' d gone up to photograph Orcas , and we had looked for a week , and we hadn ' t seen a damn Orca.
Now , to a human audience , I need to explain that if Penthouse magazine had a marine mammal edition , this would be the centerfold.
There ' s a variety of things you can learn from watching whales have sex.
That ' s kind of what it ' s like.
I just -- you know , because , yes , I ' ll focus passion on something , but then there will be something else , and then there ' s something else again.
And say ,  " Yeah , you know , I -- this whole talk has been a mile wide and an inch deep , but that ' s really what works for me. " 
In this captivating talk from the TED archive , cartoonist Ben Katchor reads from his comic strips . These perceptive , surreal stories find the profound hopes and foibles of history preserved in objects like light switches and signs.
I ' m going to read a few strips.
It ' s fine during the day when the main rooms are flooded with sunlight.
We know instinctively where to reach when we enter a dark room.
But where does this sound , commonly described as a click , come from ? 
Or is it the amplified sound of a synapse firing in the brain of a cockroach ? 
The sound made flicking a wall switch off is of a completely different nature.
Adults find it comforting.
Thomas Edison went through thousands of unlikely substances before he came upon the right one for the filament of his electric light bulb.
That so many of the city ' s most venerable taxpayers have survived yet another commercial building boom , is cause for celebration.
The most perfect examples occupy corner lots.
The few surfaces not covered by signs are often clad in a distinctive , dark green-gray , striated aluminum siding.
That ' s the end.
Over the next 200 years we see the infant Christ go from a sitting to a standing position on the Virgin ' s lap , and then back again.
The ventriloquist must first make us believe that a small boy is sitting on his lap.
We have fading memories of that provisional temple , erected each time an adult sat down.
The relationship between the lap and its owner is direct and intimate.
That ' s the end.
Do you remember wandering as a child through those dark wooden storefront galleries ? 
In 1962 the unsold stock was purchased by Maurice Haverpiece , a wealthy prune juice bottler , and consolidated to form the core collection.
The rest of the collection remains here , stored in plain brown paper bags until funds can be raised to build a permanent museum and study center.
At TEDxUSC , David Logan talks about the five kinds of tribes that humans naturally form -- in schools , workplaces , even the driver ' s license bureau . By understanding our shared tribal tendencies , we can help lead each other to become better individuals.
What we ' re really here to talk about is the  " how. " 
In fact , the date -- I ' m curious to know if any of you know what happened on this momentous date ? 
And the reason that this date was so momentous is that what my colleagues , John King and Halee Fischer-Wright , and I noticed as we began to debrief various Super Bowl parties , is that it seemed to us that across the United States , if you will , tribal councils had convened.
But they also talked about which candidate they were going to support.
Now what is a tribe ?  A tribe is a group of about 20 -- so kind of more than a team -- 20 to about 150 people.
February 4th , we posted it on our website . This was before Super Tuesday.
In walking around at the break , many of you had met members of your tribe . And you were talking to them.
If you focus in on a group like this -- this happens to be a USC game -- and you zoom in with one of those super satellite cameras and do magnification factors so you could see individual people , you would in fact see not a single crowd , just like there is not a single crowd here , but you would see these tribes that are then coming together.
Just as fish swim and birds fly , people form tribes . It ' s just what we do.
You ' re all a member of tribes.
You don ' t want this . Okay ? 
This is the kid who shot up Virginia Tech.
And I want to make the point that as members of society , we need to.
So , this other book that Steve mentioned , that just came out , called  " The Three Laws of Performance, "  my colleague , Steve Zaffron and I , argue that as people see the world , so they behave.
Now , my birthday is coming up shortly , and my driver ' s license expires.
Now , am I saying that there are dumb people working here ? 
You find them in all places in society.
If that ' s how you talked , imagine what kind of work would get done.
Now when we go on to Stage Three : this is the one that hits closest to home for many of us.
I ' m great and you ' re not.
I know this sounds like a joke . Three doctors walk into a bar.
And the other said ,  " No . That ' s great . Congratulations! " 
And the elevator door opened , and they all walked out.
Here is the greatest challenge we face in innovation.
And my question on the other side is just going to be ,  " What do you think they value ?  " 
Notice it looks like something out of a Peanuts cartoon.
They don ' t know who we are and they don ' t care . And if they did they probably wouldn ' t applaud.
But they value things like fun . And they value creativity.
The group gels . And it changes from a group of highly motivated but fairly individually-centric people into something larger , into a tribe that becomes aware of its own existence.
Now , some of you may not recognize the scene that ' s up here.
And people came together focused only on those two values : truth and reconciliation.
In fact , South Africa has not gone down that road.
That ' s like , you know ,  " Life sucks. "  Who wants to talk that way ? 
But I should really talk Stage Five , right ?   " Life is great. " 
In fact , most of the document is written at Stage Two.
Well , what about other great leaders ?  What about Gandhi ? 
In fact , Martin Luther King ' s most famous line was at Stage Three.
About 25 percent are at Stage Two , saying , in effect ,  " My life sucks. " 
And our values are beginning to unite us. " 
But you don ' t leave them where you found them . Okay ? 
I ' d like to show you some examples of this.
Now here is what happened to this person who eventually became Mayor of San Francisco.
So I ' m going to sit here in my chair and not do anything. " 
I want to argue that we ' re doing that right here.
That ' s called a triadic relationship.
But we ' re not done yet . Because then how do we go from Stage Four , which is great , to Stage Five ? 
Pretty much everybody else who does polls.
 " How could we , instead of just polling what Asia thinks or what the United States thinks , or who thinks what about Obama versus McCain or something like that , what does the entire world think ?  " 
How do we survey populations that don ' t have access to technology , and speak languages we don ' t speak , and we don ' t know anyone who speaks those languages . Because in order to achieve on this great mission , we have to be able to do it.
First of all : we all form tribes , all of us.
If you do what we ' ve talked about , you listen for how people actually communicate in the tribes that you ' re in.
And the question that I ' d like to leave you with is this : Will your tribes change the world ? 
Danny Hillis : Understanding cancer through proteomics
In order to talk about cancer , I ' m going to actually have to -- let me get the big slide here.
So let me start with genomics.
But it has its limitations.
So if I can make an analogy , let ' s say that you were trying to tell the difference between a good restaurant , a healthy restaurant and a sick restaurant , and all you had was the list of ingredients that they had in their larder.
You could certainly tell the difference between a Chinese restaurant and a French restaurant by what they had in a larder.
So if I look at a person and I look at a person ' s genome , it ' s the same thing.
But most things , you really have to know what ' s going on in the kitchen , because , mostly , sick people used to be healthy people -- they have the same genome.
So why all the big deal about genetics ? 
It ' s the one theory that the biologists ever really got right.
So this happens in physics all the time.
And Darwinian evolution is really the core theory.
There ' s a huge amount of information about the genetics just by comparing the genetic similarity.
I did the 23andMe thing and was very surprised to discover that I am fat and bald.
Just like genome mixes the study of all the genes , proteomics is the study of all the proteins.
So the problem is that measuring -- if you try to measure all the proteins , it ' s a very elaborate process.
And basically our problem is somebody ' s in the middle of this very long stage , they pause for just a moment , and they leave something in an enzyme for a second , and all of a sudden all the measurements from then on don ' t work.
I kept getting this call from this oncologist named David Agus.
So we started talking , and he said ,  " I really need a better way to measure proteins. " 
I mean , I see patients dying every day because we don ' t know what ' s going on inside of them.
Applied Minds has enough play money that we can go and just work on something without getting anybody ' s funding or permission or anything.
And I ' ll show you what that protein measurement looks like.
They really tell us what ' s going on there.
So we ' re zooming in here just to show you a little bit of it.
So we ' re actually measuring each isotope as a different one.
So this is the signature out of which we ' re trying to get patterns.
We overlay them . This is actual data.
So this already , I think , is tremendously useful in all kinds of medicine.
And as I looked at it , to me it didn ' t make sense how we were approaching cancer , and in order to make sense of it , I had to learn where did this come from.
This is another case where a theoretical paradigm in biology really worked -- was the germ theory of disease.
If you ' ve got malaria , we give you quinine or some derivative of it.
The problem is that , in cancer , there isn ' t something else that ' s inside of you.
Well , right now what we do is we divide it by part of the body -- you know , where did it appear ?  -- and we put you in different categories according to the part of the body.
I think this is the big mistake.
And so your body is probably cancering all the time , but there are lots of systems in your body that keep it under control.
That ' s kind of the level at which it is.
And it sounds silly , but that ' s basically what we do.
So your house is dealing with leaks all the time , but it ' s fixing them . It ' s draining them out and so on.
And Anna said ,  " Because nobody within cancer would look at it this way.
And we will actually try to get to the point where we have a predictive model where we can understand , when cancer happens , what ' s actually happening in there and which treatment will treat that cancer.
And so we will simulate in that model for your particular cancer -- and this also will be for ALS , or any kind of system neurodegenerative diseases , things like that -- we will simulate specifically you , not just a generic person , but what ' s actually going on inside you.
But design a program of treatments specifically for you and help your body guide back to health -- guide your body back to health.
And so I believe that this will be the way that cancer will be treated in the future.
So thank you very much.

As essential as it is across our traditions , as real as so many of us know it to be in particular lives , the word  " compassion "  is hollowed out in our culture , and it is suspect in my field of journalism.
Our cultural imagination about compassion has been deadened by idealistic images.
Now the word  " tolerance, "  if you look at it in the dictionary , connotes  " allowing, "   " indulging "  and  " enduring. " 
And the going is pretty rough right now.
Compassion is a piece of vocabulary that could change us if we truly let it sink into the standards to which we hold ourselves and others , both in our private and in our civic spaces.
To start simply , I want to say that compassion is kind.
Compassion is also curious.
Well that ' s going to be a breeding ground for compassion.
I think that compassion also is often linked to beauty -- and by that I mean a willingness to see beauty in the other , not just what it is about them that might need helping.
When we see it , we recognize it and it changes the way we think about what is doable , what is possible.
And I don ' t imagine that you will realize this when you look at this photograph of him , but he ' s paraplegic.
He says that he ' s just at an extreme end of the spectrum we ' re all on.
But he says that he has yet to experience someone who became more aware of their body , in all its frailty and its grace , without , at the same time , becoming more compassionate towards all of life.
The communities that Jean Vanier founded , like Jean Vanier himself , exude tenderness.
But again and again , lived compassion brings us back to the wisdom of tenderness.
And compassion is unleashed in wider and wider circles by signs and stories , never by statistics and strategies.
There is , of course , a story behind the key moral longing and commandment of Judaism to repair the world -- tikkun olam.
Now this might sound like a fanciful tale.
Rachel Naomi Remen is actually bringing compassion back to its rightful place alongside science in her field of medicine in the training of new doctors.
We all know about the Albert Einstein who came up with E = mc2.
But he watched physicists and chemists become the purveyors of weapons of mass destruction in the early 20th century.
Some of his favorites were Moses , Jesus , Buddha , St . Francis of Assisi , Gandhi -- he adored his contemporary , Gandhi.
So in this photograph you see a mind looking out a window at what might be a cathedral -- it ' s not.
And when I look at the second , I ask , what kind of person was he ?  What kind of man is this ?  " 
Gandhi , too , was a real flawed human being.
And I want to say that it is a liberating thing to realize that that is no obstacle to compassion -- following on what Fred Luskin says -- that these flaws just make us human.
Einstein became a humanitarian , not because of his exquisite knowledge of space and time and matter , but because he was a Jew as Germany grew fascist.
Now our traditions contain vast wisdom about this , and we need them to mine it for us now.
In a culture where being social and outgoing are prized above all else , it can be difficult , even shameful , to be an introvert . But , as Susan Cain argues in this passionate talk , introverts bring extraordinary talents and abilities to the world , and should be encouraged and celebrated.
When I was nine years old I went off to summer camp for the first time.
You have the animal warmth of your family sitting right next to you , but you are also free to go roaming around the adventureland inside your own mind.
And on the very first day our counselor gathered us all together and she taught us a cheer that she said we would be doing every day for the rest of the summer to instill camp spirit.
So I couldn ' t figure out for the life of me why we were supposed to be so rowdy , or why we had to spell this word incorrectly.
But the first time that I took my book out of my suitcase , the coolest girl in the bunk came up to me and she asked me ,  " Why are you being so mellow ?  "  -- mellow , of course , being the exact opposite of R-O-W-D-I-E.
I felt as if the books needed me somehow , and they were calling out to me and I was forsaking them.
And I always sensed deep down that this was wrong and that introverts were pretty excellent just as they were.
Now this is what many introverts do , and it ' s our loss for sure , but it is also our colleagues '  loss and our communities '  loss.
So that ' s one out of every two or three people you know.
It ' s different from being shy.
Not all the time -- these things aren ' t absolute -- but a lot of the time.
And also we have this belief system right now that I call the new groupthink , which holds that all creativity and all productivity comes from a very oddly gregarious place.
And kids are working in countless group assignments.
Okay , same thing is true in our workplaces.
Now in fact , some of our transformative leaders in history have been introverts.
And this turns out to have a special power all its own , because people could feel that these leaders were at the helm , not because they enjoyed directing others and not out of the pleasure of being looked at ; they were there because they had no choice , because they were driven to do what they thought was right.
Even Carl Jung , the psychologist who first popularized these terms , said that there ' s no such thing as a pure introvert or a pure extrovert.
But many of us do recognize ourselves as one type or the other.
And this is because solitude is a crucial ingredient often to creativity.
Steve Wozniak invented the first Apple computer sitting alone in his cubical in Hewlett-Packard where he was working at the time.
It ' s only recently that we ' ve strangely begun to forget it.
It turns out that we can ' t even be in a group of people without instinctively mirroring , mimicking their opinions.
You might be following the person with the best ideas , but you might not.
Why are we setting up our schools this way and our workplaces ? 
But in America ' s early days , we lived in what historians call a culture of character , where we still , at that point , valued people for their inner selves and their moral rectitude.
But then we hit the 20th century and we entered a new culture that historians call the culture of personality.
So , quite understandably , qualities like magnetism and charisma suddenly come to seem really important.
That ' s our cultural inheritance.
But I am saying that the more freedom that we give introverts to be themselves , the more likely that they are to come up with their own unique solutions to these problems.
I have a suitcase full of books.
But these are not exactly my books.
Just like the rest of my family , my grandfather ' s favorite thing to do in the whole world was to read.
But here ' s the thing about my grandfather.
And so these days I try to learn from my grandfather ' s example in my own way.
But now all of a sudden my job is very different , and my job is to be out here talking about it , talking about introversion.
And I call this my  " year of speaking dangerously. " 
And so I am going to leave you now with three calls for action for those who share this vision.
And I want to be clear about what I ' m saying , because I deeply believe our offices should be encouraging casual , chatty cafe-style types of interactions -- you know , the kind where people come together and serendipitously have an exchange of ideas.
School , same thing.
Okay , number two : Go to the wilderness.
So extroverts , maybe your suitcases are also full of books.
And that ' s okay.
Thank you . Thank you.

I would have never imagined that , not in my wildest dreams did I think -- I don ' t even consider myself to be an author.
I think inside at some point , we put our heads down on the pillow and we go ,  " There ' s got to be more to life than this. " 
I really think that ' s there ' s this inner desire.
I don ' t think there are accidental kids.
I meet a lot of people who are very smart , and say ,  " But why can ' t I figure out my problems ?  " 
I think that comes down to this issue of meaning , of significance , of purpose.
As a pastor , I do see a lot of kooks.
There are people -- a lady came up to me the other day , and she had a white piece of paper -- Michael , you ' ll like this one -- and she said ,  " What do you see in it ?  " 
Um.
Because it brought in enormous amounts of money.
And I decided that I was never going to go on TV , because I didn ' t want to be a celebrity , I didn ' t want to be a , quote ,  " evangelist , televangelist "  -- that ' s not my thing.
You ' re betting your life on something -- you just better know why you ' re betting what you ' re betting on.
And then when I wrote this book , and all of a sudden it just took off , then I started saying , now , what ' s the purpose of this ? 
That ' s kind of a no-brainer.
That if you are a leader in any area -- in business , in politics , in sports , in art , in academics , in any area -- you don ' t own it ; you are a steward of it.
I ' m just here for 80 years and then that ' s it.
And he said ,  " No. " 
Not any more than any other species. " 
You ' re not a duck.
They never really codify it or qualify it or quantify it , and say ,  " This is what I believe in.
Your worldview , though , does determine everything else in your life , because it determines your decisions ; it determines your relationships ; it determines your level of confidence.
My wife and I first made five decisions on what to do with the money.
I still drive the same four-year-old Ford that I ' ve driven.
And I gave it back because I didn ' t want anybody thinking that I do what I do for money -- I don ' t.
Pastors are like on 24-hours-a-day call . They ' re like doctors.
And having been through literally hundreds if not thousands of funerals , it makes a difference.
And that is , when my wife and I got married 30 years ago , we started tithing.
Because every time I give , it breaks the grip of materialism in my life.
But that ' s not the good life.
It ' s just not true.
It doesn ' t come from sex.
That ' s the way we were wired , I believe , by God.
Because I start getting all kinds of invitations.
There ' s a chapter in the Bible called Psalm 72 , and it ' s Solomon ' s prayer for more influence.
He says ,  " I want you to make me famous.
I want you to give me influence. " 
Basically , he ' s talking about all the marginalized in society.
Your value is not based on your valuables ; it ' s based on a whole different set of things.
I pastor a church in one of the most affluent areas of America -- a bunch of gated communities.
Now , they ' re 13 miles up the road in Santa Ana.
But Moses , if you saw the movie ,  " The Ten Commandments, "  Moses goes out , and there ' s this burning bush , and God talks to him.
Moses says ,  " It ' s a staff.
And then God says ,  " Pick it up. " 
Number one , God never does a miracle to show off.
OK ?  I just , this is why I love what Michael does , because it ' s like , OK , if he ' s debunking it , then I don ' t have to.
Second thing is , if God ever asks you a question , He already knows the answer.
Well , it was a shepherd ' s staff . Now , follow me on this.
I am a shepherd . It ' s a symbol of his identity , his career , his job.
So it ' s a symbol of his identity , and it ' s a symbol of his income.
You pull them or you poke them , one or the other.
And He ' s saying ,  " If you lay it down , I ' ll make it come alive.
And so , I ' m talking to the players , because most of the NBA teams , NFL teams and all the other teams have done this 40 Days of Purpose , based on the book.
You ' re making a lot of money off that little ball.
So , what are you going to do with what you ' ve been given ?  " 
What are you doing with what you ' ve been given ? 
This little cross takes spiritual gifts , heart , ability , personality and experiences.
If you ' re wired to be an anthropologist , you ' ll be an anthropologist.
Did you know that God smiles when you be you ? 
Rise and lower -- and I got joy out of just watching them sleep.
That ' s my girl.
http://www.ted.com/talks/hector_ruiz_on_connecting_the_world.html
Hector Ruiz on connecting the world
Because I really think , when I look back at how I actually ended up in this accident , technology played a big role in that.
Then , about the initiative that Chris mentioned , that we decided to launch at AMD that we call 50x15.
I learned a lot about how to deal with that part of the world.
My parents were fanatics about learning , and I ' ll come back to that a little bit later.
And would tell me a little bit about history too , when he ' d play the 1812 Overture by Tchaikovsky on this little Victrola , and he would tell me about Russia and all the things that were happening in Russia at those times and why this music , in some way , represented a little bit of that history.
And I always said that they were really tough on me.
And the second thing they said : and we trust you , that no matter where you are or where you go , you will always do the right thing.
So , one of our passions in our company , and now one of my personal passions , is to be able to really work hard at making the technology useful , accessible and affordable.
A tremendous thing that people refer to as a killer app is called the Internet.
And the power of connecting people and ideas can be pretty awesome.
And a couple of years ago at AMD , we came up with this idea of saying , what if we create this initiative we call 50x15 , where we are going to aim , that by the year 2015 , half of the world will be connected to the Internet so that people and ideas can get connected.
And I ' ll come back to that in a minute , because I think the results so far have been remarkable , and I can only anticipate and get real excited about what I think is going to happen in the next eight years , while we get to the 2015 initiative.
And so when we gave ourselves this scorecard to say well , where are we related to our goal towards 2015 , the thing that becomes apparent is three pieces.
I had the opportunity to have a discussion with President Mbeki , and one of the things that we talked about is , what is it that ' s keeping this connectivity goal from moving ahead faster ? 
So , when you look at this chart , you look at the very last -- it ' s a logarithmic chart on a horizontal scale -- you look at the very end : we ' ve got quite a long way to go to get to the 2015 goal of 50 percent.
It is actually a business venture.
And when we embarked in this initiative , from the very beginning we said it very clearly : this is not a charity.
What we mean by that is , you know , frankly , the PC was invented in 1980 , roughly speaking more or less , and for 20-odd years , it hasn ' t changed.
It reminded me a lot of the talk we heard this morning , about this operating room machinery that was designed specifically for Africa.
In other parts , it doesn ' t.
What I mean by that , and let me use this example , the country of South Africa , because I was just there , therefore I ' m a little bit familiar with some of the challenges they have.
They have a computer company that makes computers in South Africa.
I don ' t think this segment of the market can be addressed by companies parachuting from another place of the world , and just dumping product and selling into the markets.
Those of you that might be familiar with Mexico -- Michoacan is a very colorful state.
We have now deployed 30 different technologists in 18 different countries , and we have been able to connect millions of people in an effort to continue to learn what this particular segment of the market needs and demands.
Some of you are familiar with this.
Because it was felt that a school day would last at least eight hours , and you wanted the child to have the ability to use the laptop for at least one full day without having to recharge it.
We also have partnered with TED in this project , with Architecture for Humanity , and along with the TED Prize winner Cameron Sinclair , we ' re having a contest that we have issued to the architectural community to come up with the best design for a computer lab for an emerging region.
I don ' t think it ' s enough to be able to put them on a spreadsheet , and look at numbers and say , yes , that ' s a good business.
And it ' s really important you understand that for civilization to make progress , each generation has to do better than the last one.
I graduated . I decided to get married.
That ' s when it dawned on me the tremendous challenge that he was placing on me , because he was a great father.
TED follows Nicholas Negroponte to Colombia as he delivers laptops inside territory once controlled by guerrillas . His partner ?  Colombia ' s Defense Department , who see One Laptop per Child as an investment in the region.
It ' s amazing , when you meet a head of state and you say ,  " What is your most precious natural resource ?  "  -- they will not say children at first.
There are one billion children in the world , and 50 percent of them don ' t have electricity at home or at school.
We have half a million laptops today in the hands of children.
In Colombia , we have about 3,000 laptops.
The change is absolutely monumental , because it ' s not just opening it up , but it ' s opening it up to the rest of the world.
Interestingly enough , in other countries , it will be the Minister of Finance who sees it as an engine of economic growth.
Now what are some of the results ? 
And so when I met with three children from the schools , who had traveled all day to come to Bogota , one of the three children brought her mother.
So now , in closing , people say , now why laptops ? 
They need to learn learning . And then , just think -- they can have , let ' s say , 100 books.
So we ' re once again doing  " Give One , Get One. " 
Places that are not markets , seeding it with the principles of saturation , connectivity , low ages , etc.
You don ' t vaccinate a few children.

And somewhere in the middle of South Dakota , I turn to my friend and I ask her a question that ' s been bothering me for 2,000 miles.
And I ' m like ,  " You know , all the signs we keep seeing with the Chinese character on them. " 
I ' ve spent the last five years of my life thinking about situations exactly like this -- why we sometimes misunderstand the signs around us , and how we behave when that happens , and what all of this can tell us about human nature.
We get it in the abstract.
And the thing is , the present tense is where we live.
I think it ' s a problem for each of us as individuals , in our personal and professional lives , and I think it ' s a problem for all of us collectively as a culture.
So why do we get stuck in this feeling of being right ? 
Embarrassing . Okay , wonderful , great.
I mean it can be devastating , it can be revelatory , it can actually be quite funny , like my stupid Chinese character mistake.
In pretty much every episode of this cartoon , there ' s a moment where the coyote is chasing the roadrunner and the roadrunner runs off a cliff , which is fine -- he ' s a bird , he can fly.
That ' s when he falls.
It does feel like something to be wrong ; it feels like being right.
But there ' s a second reason that we get stuck inside this feeling as well -- and this one is cultural.
So there you are in grade school , and you know exactly what to think about the kid who got this paper.
And a lot of us -- and I suspect , especially a lot of us in this room -- deal with them by just becoming perfect little A students , perfectionists , over-achievers.
Except that then we freak out at the possibility that we ' ve gotten something wrong.
A couple of years ago , a woman comes into Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center for a surgery.
She ' s anesthetized , the surgeon does his thing -- stitches her back up , sends her out to the recovery room.
When the vice president for health care quality at Beth Israel spoke about this incident , he said something very interesting.
And when we act like it is , and we stop entertaining the possibility that we could be wrong , well that ' s when we end up doing things like dumping 200 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico , or torpedoing the global economy.
It means that you think that your beliefs just perfectly reflect reality.
They don ' t have access to the same information that we do , and when we generously share that information with them , they ' re going to see the light and come on over to our team.
So this is a catastrophe.
And we want everybody else to gaze out of the same window and see the exact same thing.
We can remember the past , and we can think about the future , and we can imagine what it ' s like to be some other person in some other place.
Augustine understood that our capacity to screw up , it ' s not some kind of embarrassing defect in the human system , something we can eradicate or overcome.
To me , this obsession is the source and root of all of our productivity and creativity.
I ' ve become the crazy wrongness lady.
In fact, "  he says ,  " as a staff , we joke that every single episode of our show has the same crypto-theme.
We love things like plot twists and red herrings and surprise endings.
George Bush thought he was going to invade Iraq , find a bunch of weapons of mass destruction , liberate the people and bring democracy to the Middle East.
And I have to tell you that I thought I was writing an incredibly nerdy book about a subject everybody hates for an audience that would never materialize.
We just spent an entire week talking about innovations and advancements and improvements , but you know why we need all of those innovations and advancements and improvements ? 
So here we are again.
We hold another conference.
Thank you.

Bioenergy isn ' t global warming . Bioenergy is something which seems counterintuitive . Bioenergy is oil . It ' s gas . It ' s coal . And part of building that bridge to the future , to the point where we can actually see the oceans in a rational way , or put up these geo-spatial orbits that will twirl or do microwaves or stuff , is going to depend on how we understand bioenergy and manage it . And to do that , you really have to look first at agriculture.
You put together machines and water , and you get landscapes that look like this . And then you get sales that look like this . It ' s brute force . So what you ' ve been doing in agriculture is you start out with something that ' s a reasonably natural system . You start taming that natural system . You put a lot of force behind that natural system . You put a whole bunch of pesticides and herbicides -- -- behind that natural system , and you end up with systems that look like this.
And Mexico remains one of the largest grain importers on the planet because it doesn ' t apply technology that was discovered in Mexico . And in fact , hasn ' t recognized this man , to the point where there aren ' t statues of this man all over Mexico . There are in China and India . And the Institute that this guy ran has now moved to India . That is the difference between adopting technologies and discussing technologies.
The effect of this , of course , is it ' s not just amber waves of grain , it is mountains of stuff.
One of the ironies of this whole system is we ' re discussing what to do about a system that we don ' t understand . We don ' t even know what oil is . We don ' t know where oil comes from . I mean , literally , it ' s still a source of debate what this black river of stuff is and where it comes from . The best assumption , and one of the best guesses in this stuff , is that this stuff comes out of this stuff , that these things absorb sunlight , rot under pressure for millions of years , and you get these black rivers.
This is how you farm oil . And as you think of farming oil and how oil has evolved , we started with this brute force approach . And then what did we learn ?  Then we learned we had to go bigger . And then what ' d we learn ?  Then we have to go even bigger . And we are getting really destructive as we ' re going out and farming this bioenergy.
Which is curious as we debate all this stuff . But as you think of coal , this is what burned wheat kernels look like . Not entirely unlike coal.
As you think of what are the alternatives to this system -- it ' s important to find alternatives because it turns out that the U.S . is dwindling in its petroleum reserves , but it is not dwindling in its coal reserves , nor is China . There are huge coal reserves that are sitting out there , and we ' ve got to start thinking of them as biological energy , because if we keep treating them as chemical energy , or engineering energy , we ' re going to be in deep doo-doo.
That is what bioenergy is . It is not ethanol . It is not subsidies to a few companies . It is not importing corn into Iowa because you ' ve built so many of these ethanol plants . It is beginning to understand the transition that occurred in agriculture , from brute force into biological force . And in the measure that you can do that , you can clean some stuff , and you can clean it pretty quickly.
Think of the cell as a hardware . Think of the genes as a software . And in the measure that you begin to think of life as code that is interchangeable , that can become energy , that can become food , that can become fiber , that can become human beings , that can become a whole series of things , then you ' ve got to shift your approach as to how you ' re going to structure and deal and think about energy in a very different way.
And as you think about this stuff and what the implications of this are , we ' re going to start not just converting ethanol from corn with very high subsidies . We ' re going to start thinking about biology entering energy . It is very expensive to process this stuff , both in economic terms and in energy terms.
86 percent of the energy we consume are hydrocarbons . That means 86 percent of the stuff we ' re consuming are probably processed plants and amoebas and the rest of the stuff . And there ' s a role in here for conservation . There ' s a role in here for alternative stuff , but we ' ve also got to get that other portion right.
The oil price goes through the floor . That company goes out of business , and then you can bring the oil price back up.
When the dotcom bubble burst , hotelier Chip Conley went in search of a business model based on happiness . In an old friendship with an employee and in the wisdom of a Buddhist king , he learned that success comes from what you count.
I ' m going to talk about the simple truth in leadership in the 21st century.
Let me start by telling you a little story.
Her first job was at an inner-city motel in San Francisco as a maid.
And this first hotel that I bought , motel , was a pay-by-the-hour , no-tell motel in the inner-city of San Francisco.
Her job , her goal and her calling was not to become the world ' s greatest toilet scrubber.
That very human lesson , more than 20 years ago , served me well during the last economic downturn we had.
Well , not exactly , of course not.
We ' re an American company . We ' re based in San Francisco. " 
But given my befuddled state of mind , I ended up in the self-help section very quickly.
One of the simplest facts in business is something that we often neglect , and that is that we ' re all human.
So I realized in that dotcom crash that my role in life was to channel Abe Maslow.
These three levels of the hierarchy needs relate to the five levels of Maslow ' s hierarchy of needs.
For example , we actually started asking our employees , do they understand the mission of our company , and do they feel like they believe in it , can they actually influence it , and do they feel that their work actually has an impact on it ? 
Our employee turnover dropped to one-third of the industry average , and during that five year dotcom bust , we tripled in size.
So I started asking myself the question : How can we get leaders to start valuing the intangible ? 
So here ' s another Einstein quote :  " Not everything that can be counted counts , and not everything that counts can be counted. " 
It ' s actually moved from the survival base of the pyramid to becoming a transformational role model for the world.
On a trip through India , early in his reign as king , he was asked by an Indian journalist about the Bhutanese GDP , the size of the Bhutanese GDP.
Now , in essence , the king was asking us to consider an alternative definition of success , what has come to be known as GNH , or gross national happiness.
For the next three dozen years as king , this king actually started measuring and managing around happiness in Bhutan -- including , just recently , taking his country from being an absolute monarchy to a constitutional monarchy with no bloodshed , no coup.
Over dinner , I asked him an impertinent question.
In other words , we create a habitat of happiness. " 
It ' s a good question . How do you feel about how you spend your time each day ? 
And it focuses on something I read long ago from a guy named Rabbi Hyman Schachtel.
The Bhutanese aren ' t on some aspirational treadmill , constantly focused on what they don ' t have.
The reality is , in Western countries , quite often we do focus on the pursuit of happiness as if happiness is something that we have to go out -- an object that we ' re supposed to get , or maybe many objects.
Bhutan ' s bordered on its north and south by 38 percent of the world ' s population.
Sarkozy suggested that world leaders should stop myopically focusing on GDP and consider a new index , what some French are calling a  " joie de vivre index. " 
So it suggests that the momentum is shifting.
But it doesn ' t count the health of our children or the integrity of our public officials.
Wow.
We ' re spending 10 billion dollars on the census.
They ' re about where you live , how many people you live with , and whether you own your home or not.
We ' re not asking anything that ' s intangible.
Excuse that expression.
And yet , 64 percent of the world ' s GDP today is in that intangible industry we call service , the service industry , the industry I ' m in.
I guess I ' m sort of a curious CEO.
In fact , as leaders , what we need to learn is that we can influence the quality of that unit of production by creating the conditions for our employees to live their calling.
They ' ve created a habitat of happiness for Dave.
In fact , inspired employees quite often help make sizable profits , right ? 
What really counts is when we actually use our numbers to truly take into account our people.
http://www.ted.com/talks/beau_lotto_amy_o_toole_science_is_for_everyone_kids_included.html
Beau Lotto + Amy O’Toole : Science is for everyone , kids included
Okay , one , two , three . Audience : Can you read this ? 
Audience : What are you reading ? 
That ' s what you should have said . Right ?  Why is this ? 
Right ?  It ' s getting information . It ' s generating behavior that ' s useful.
And perception underpins everything we think , we know , we believe , our hopes , our dreams , the clothes we wear , falling in love , everything begins with perception.
They begin with a question.
Even seasickness is a consequence of uncertainty.
And yet , the irony is , the only way we can ever do anything new is to step into that space.
It ' s easy to ask questions about how did life begin , or what extends beyond the universe , but to question what you think to be true already is really stepping into that space.
Play is one of the only human endeavors where uncertainty is actually celebrated . Uncertainty is what makes play fun.
It ' s actually a way of being , which is here , and this is true for anything that is creative.
And who better to ask than 25 eight- to 10-year-old children ? 
So we did it anyway . Right ?  Of course.
She was one of the young people who was involved in this study , and she ' s now one of the youngest published scientists in the world . Right ?  She will now , once she comes onto stage , will be the youngest person to ever speak at TED . Right ? 
So Amy ' s going to help me tell the story of what we call the Blackawton Bees Project , and first she ' s going to tell you the question that they came up with . So go ahead , Amy.
Really , we wanted to know if bees can also adapt themselves to new situations using previously learned rules and conditions . So what if bees can think like us ? 
AO : The puzzle we came up with was an if-then rule.
What was really exciting about this project was we , and Beau , had no idea whether it would work.
So I ' m not going to go through the whole details of the study because actually you can read about it , but the next step is observation . So here are some of the students doing the observations . They ' re recording the data of where the bees fly.
BL :  " Can you help me , Henry ?  "  What good scientist says that , right ? 
They do the simple mathematics , averaging , etc. , etc.
The one on the left is mine , okay ? 
And the discussion is , who cares ?  Right ? 
And the methods , it says ,  " Then we put the bees into the fridge , "  smiley face . Right ? 
The first author is Blackawton Primary School , because if it were ever referenced , it would be  " Blackawton et al, "  and not one individual . So we submit it to a public access journal , and it says this . It said many things , but it said this.
Larry Maloney , expert in vision , says ,  " The paper is magnificent.
So we asked Larry and Natalie Hempel to write a commentary situating the findings for scientists , right , putting in the references , and we submit it to Biology Letters.
What was the feedback like ? 
It ' s the only paper that will ever be freely accessible by this journal.
What you guys have done is real , true and amazing.
So I ' d like to conclude with a physical metaphor.
For me , not for him . Right ?  Because we ' ve only done this once before.
Now ...
Okay , how about if everyone over there shouts . One , two , three ? 
Thank you very much.
Now , true science education I think should be about giving people a voice and enabling to express that voice , so I ' ve asked Amy to be the last voice in this short story.
But changing the way I thought about science was surprisingly easy . Once we played the games and then started to think about the puzzle , I then realized that science isn ' t just a boring subject , and that anyone can discover something new.
Van Jones lays out a case against plastic pollution from the perspective of social justice . Because plastic trash , he shows us , hits poor people and poor countries  " first and worst, "  with consequences we all share no matter where we live and what we earn . At TEDxGPGP , he offers a few powerful ideas to help us reclaim our throwaway planet.
I am honored to be here , and I ' m honored to talk about this topic , which I think is of grave importance.
People thought about ,  " Oh , my God.
This is a terrible thing , that the oil is going to hurt the people in the Gulf. " 
It shortens the lives of the people who live there in the Gulf.
Poor people also suffer at the point of use.
Other people who are poor don ' t have those choices.
Well , the problem with being poor is you don ' t have those choices.
Often , we think we ' re doing a good thing.
You think ,  " I put mine in the blue bin, "  and then you look at your colleague and say ,  " Why , you cretin.
Maybe I ' ll feel good myself.
I think in our minds we imagine somebody ' s going to take the little bottle , say ,  " Oh , little bottle.
And say ,  " What would you like to do next ?  " 
Recycling of plastic in many developing countries means the incineration of the plastic , the burning of the plastic , which releases incredible toxic chemicals and , once again , kills people.
I hope someone does something to help them. " 
Because they ' re doing so much dirty production in Asia now , because the environmental laws don ' t protect the people in Asia now , almost all of the clean air gains and the toxic air gains that we ' ve achieved here in California have been wiped out by dirty air coming over from Asia.
We ' re back where we were in the 1970s.
But if you create a world where you don ' t trash people , you can ' t trash the planet.
We don ' t have disposable species.
Biomimicry , which is something that is an emerging science , winds up being a very important social justice idea.
It turns out we ' re a pretty clever species.
I ' m so clever, "  and you look behind you , and there ' s destruction all around you.
There ' s no poison . There ' s no pollution.
I don ' t mean looking at it from that way -- abusing the little species.
We would have a different economy.
We ' re so proud to live here in California.
And , yeah , I ' m proud , too.
We are passionate about rescuing some dead materials from the landfill , but sometimes not as passionate about rescuing living beings , living people.
And yet , as a movement that has to broaden its constituency , that has to grow , that has to reach out beyond our natural comfort zone , one of the challenges to the success of this movement , of getting rid of things like plastic and helping the economy shift , is people look at our movement with some suspicion.
And so we now get a chance to be truly proud of this movement.
Can ' t love the whole world -- you ' ve got to work on trees , or you ' ve got to work on immigration.
Well , when you start working on issues like plastic , you realize that the whole thing is connected , and luckily most of us are blessed to have two arms.
design,engineering,invention,technology,transportation
A number of years ago , Mr . Ford predicted that flying cars of some form would be available.
It was a trying and scary thing for a young kid to be going through.
I thought , what a great way to get to school.
Volantor-like helicopter , perhaps.
So for once , perhaps , the government is ahead of itself.
It ' s actually classified as a motorcycle because of the three wheels , which is a great asset because it allows you , theoretically , to use this on the highways in most states , and actually in all cities.
It ' s often been described because of its fragile nature and its complexity , as a series of parts -- a large number of parts -- flying in formation.
And it ' s been a great motivator.
If we can get rid of that , then the highways will now be useful to you , as contrasted by what ' s happening in many parts of the world today.
This world that you ' re going to be talking about tomorrow is going to be completely integrated . You ' re not going to be a pilot , you ' re going to be a passenger.
But we have to have these priority changes , we have to have infrastructure to go with this.
However , the next 10 years , if like the last 10 years , we ' re going to see 30 percent more traffic.
And of course , if you ask me , I ' m going to give you a really optimistic view.
Now I would argue , actually , if you look at the fact that on the highways today , you ' re only averaging about 30 miles per hour -- on average , according to the DOT -- the Skycar travels at over 300 miles an hour , up to 25,000 feet.
With those three systems , you have what is always necessary -- a level of redundancy that says , if one system fails , you ' ll still have a way to make sure that you ' re being controlled.
I mean to be able to take off from your home , you ' d have to be extremely quiet.
After all , if you can fly like that , why are you going to drive around on a highway ? 
And of course , I suppose like recreational parks you can still do that.
I was a professor at the U.C . Davis System , and I got a lot of excitement around this , and I was able to fund the initiation of the program back in that time.
Finally , in the early part of -- or actually the middle of 2002 , we flew the 400 -- M400 , which was the four-passenger vehicle.
A vertical-takeoff aircraft is not the safest vehicle during the test flight program.
If that single-stability system , that brain that flies that aircraft , fails , or if the engine fails , that vehicle crashes . There is no option to that.
And there ' s really only one operational aircraft in the world today that ' s a vertical-takeoff aircraft -- as distinct from a helicopter -- and that ' s the Hawker Harrier jump jet.
A very unique engine -- it ' s round , it ' s small , it ' s vibration-free.
In that application , it generates one horsepower per pound , which is twice as good as your car engine today , but only half of what we need.
We have four computers . We have two parachutes.
The computers back up each other . There ' s a voting system -- if one computer is not agreeing with the other three , it ' s kicked out of the system.
There won ' t be a third chance.
Video : Skycar dispatched , launch rescue vehicle for San Francisco.
that ' s a very significant incentive for getting out of San Francisco.
And that has -- you run into situations where you have this great acceptance of what you ' re doing , and a lot of rejection of the same kind of thing.
Forty-seven percent -- yes , as soon as they could -- price could come down.
That we need an alternative to the automobile , at least for those 50-mile trips and more , so that the highways become usable in today ' s world.
619
They thought ,  " Who would use it if you didn ' t ?  " 
We ' ll never know if this stuff worked . Actually , I think the Federal Bureau of Investigation took it down for security purposes , sometime in the early 1900s.
The other thing is , we love batteries.
So I thought I ' d better look it up first.
The other thing is , batteries suck too.
This is what happens.
The most expensive grid power in the world is thousandths of that.
Basically they were able to light a 60 watt light bulb at a distance of about two meters.
The light bulb was a fairly simple task , from their standpoint.
But inside a standard transformer are two coils of wire.
So how does it work ? 
And then what you do is , you start out with electricity , turn it into magnetic field , take that magnetic field , turn it back into electricity , and then you can use it.
The first thing is this is not a  " radiative "  technology.
And actually , the magnetic fields we ' re using are basically about the same as the Earth ' s magnetic field.
Then finally we have governmental bodies everywhere that will regulate everything we do.
Those cords under your desk , I bet everybody here has something that looks like that or those batteries.
But who is going to want to plug them in ? 
Credit cards , robot vacuum cleaners.
That coil is connected to an R.F . amplifier that creates a high-frequency oscillating magnetic field.
But then what ' s going to happen is , it will create a field.
Generally , you have to go over and hit the button . So I thought we put a little computer in it that has to wake up to tell it to do that.
And as I said , in sort of about 10 seconds we should start to see ...
Think about it . You don ' t want those ugly cords coming down.
And I ' ll do it again , just for safety ' s sake.
We ' re an equal opportunity designer of this sort of thing.
I think I heard somebody talk about that before.
you ' re looking at a cellphone powered completely wirelessly.
And those of you that have an iPhone recognize the green center.
So , imagine these things could go .. . they could go in your ceiling.
And think of what that would do for you.

Jae Rhim Lee : My mushroom burial suit
It ' s a material hardener and synthetic estrogen that ' s found in the lining of canned foods and some plastics.
But it ' s just one chemical.
First , don ' t become a cannibal.
The short answer is : They return to the environment in one way or another , continuing the cycle of toxicity.
And in a traditional American funeral , a dead body is covered with fillers and cosmetics to make it look alive.
I think there ' s a better solution.
But I learned it ' s nearly impossible to create a new hybrid mushroom.
As the mushrooms grow , I pick the best feeders to become Infinity Mushrooms.
Just a little.
See for me , cultivating the Infinity Mushroom is more than just scientific experimentation or gardening or raising a pet , it ' s a step towards accepting the fact that someday I will die and decay.
And now about these ninja pajamas.
It ' s covered with a crocheted netting that is embedded with mushroom spores.
So I plan to finish the mushroom and decompiculture kit in the next year or two , and then I ' d like to begin testing them , first with expired meat from the market and then with human subjects.
The Decompiculture Society shares a vision of a cultural shift , from our current culture of death denial and body preservation to one of decompiculture , a radical acceptance of death and decomposition.
I believe this is the beginning of true environmental responsibility.

What it means is the Web is going to become an exciting place again.
When you think about it , we ' re so constrained by browsing the Web , remembering URLs , saving favorites.
In order to do that , we have to put you as a user back in the driver ' s seat.
So Virtual Earth is about starting off creating the first digital representation , comprehensive , of the entire world.
Well , we collect data from satellites , from airplanes , from ground vehicles , from people.
In addition , it ' s multi-spectral.
You can see the camera on the front . We collect multiple viewpoints , vantage points , angles , textures . We bring all that data back in.
The poor PC guy . They ' re duct taping his head . They ' re just wrapping it on him.
We think a lot of good can come from this technology.
We made it all freely available on the Web , just to -- it was obviously our chance of helping out with the cause.
Extract geometry from the images.
They ' d drive the streets with lasers called LIDAR.
We think about the user interface.
What we ' re doing is -- people like this a lot , this bird ' s eye imagery we work with . It ' s this high resolution data.
You can see all types of resolution . From here , I can slowly pan the image over.
I can look at it from multiple viewpoints and angles.

Yasheng Huang : Does democracy stifle economic growth ? 
Actually , exactly the opposite is what I ' m going to do.
In the last five years , the two countries have begun to converge somewhat in economic growth.
This is the Pudong area.
Whereas in India , you cannot do that , because you have to listen to the public.
This is an Oxford-trained economist steeped in humanistic values , and yet he agrees with the high-pressure tactics of Shanghai.
You need also state ownership , especially of land assets , in order to build and roll out infrastructures very quickly.
This is a key issue.
And for the sake of brevity , I ' ll call one country Country 1 and the other country Country 2.
if you believe in the infrastructure view , then you will say ,  " Country 1 must be China.
After the country reported very impressive statistics on telephones , the country collapsed.
Telephones , infrastructures do not guarantee you economic growth.
Country 1 , that has a longer system of railways , is actually India.
But for many years , until the late 1990s , China had an infrastructure disadvantage vis-a-vis India.
In fact , if you look at the evidence worldwide , the evidence is more supportive of the view that the infrastructure are actually the result of economic growth.
Is democracy bad for economic growth ? 
Both countries are in Asia.
In fact , Country A is democratic India , and Country B is Pakistan -- the country that has a long period of military rule.
Those two countries are geographically similar.
One reason is the East Asian Model.
And they all tell you ,  " Yes , we have won the lottery. " 
Korea succeeded , North Korea didn ' t.
If you look at the statistical evidence worldwide , there ' s really no support for the idea that authoritarian governments hold a systematic edge over democracies in terms of economic growth.
The question there is : Which country did better , China or India ? 
The whole country went mad.
And this is the earliest data that I can find.
In China , the definition of literacy is the ability to read and write 1,500 Chinese characters.
China held a huge advantage in terms of human capital vis-a-vis India.
If you made that decision in 1965 , the down side of that is the next year we have the Cultural Revolution.
This is an extremely strange fact.
Today , Indian women have a sizable life expectancy edge over Indian men.
In China , it ' s all women.
If you look at other East Asian countries , women there play a hugely important role in terms of economic take-off -- in terms of creating the manufacturing miracle associated with East Asia.
What about the political system ? 
Statically , China is a one-party system , authoritarian -- there ' s no question about it.
In terms of the political changes , they have introduced village elections.
There is also a rural entrepreneurial revolution in China.
You can apply exactly the same dynamic perspective on India.
A little-known fact about India in the 1990s is that the country not only has undertaken economic reforms , the country has also undertaken political reforms by introducing village self-rule , privatization of media and introducing freedom of information acts.
But China is a superstar in terms of economic growth.
In fact , if you compare India with the average developing country , even before the more recent period of acceleration of Indian growth -- now India is growing between eight and nine percent -- even before this period , India was ranked fourth in terms of economic growth among emerging economies.
China , I believe , still has some of the excellent raw fundamentals -- mostly the social capital , the public health , the sense of egalitarianism that you don ' t find in India.
I believe the government should do more , but nevertheless , the direction it is moving in is the right direction.
I don ' t know whether that ' s going to happen or not , but I ' m an optimist.
collaboration,innovation,novel,science,technology
This is the Grand Cafe here in Oxford.
Because , before the spread of coffee and tea through British culture , what people drank -- both elite and mass folks drank -- day-in and day-out , from dawn until dusk was alcohol.
And so , effectively until the rise of the coffeehouse , you had an entire population that was effectively drunk all day.
But the other thing that makes the coffeehouse important is the architecture of the space.
And an astonishing number of innovations from this period have a coffeehouse somewhere in their story.
And what I ' ve done is I ' ve looked at both environments like the coffeehouse ; I ' ve looked at media environments , like the world wide web , that have been extraordinarily innovative ; I ' ve gone back to the history of the first cities ; I ' ve even gone to biological environments , like coral reefs and rainforests , that involve unusual levels of biological innovation ; and what I ' ve been looking for is shared patterns , kind of signature behavior that shows up again and again in all of these environments.
We have this very rich vocabulary to describe moments of inspiration.
I mean , this is what is happening inside your brain.
And it turns out that , in fact , the kind of network patterns of the outside world mimic a lot of the network patterns of the internal world of the human brain.
One of the things that ' s very frustrating about this is that we know , by getting modern neonatal incubators into any context , if we can keep premature babies warm , basically -- it ' s very simple -- we can halve infant mortality rates in those environments.
And so you end up having this problem where you spend all this money getting aid and all these advanced electronics to these countries , and then it ends up being useless.
They seem to have the expertise to keep cars working.
From the outside , it looks like a normal little thing you ' d find in a modern , Western hospital.
Now , that ' s a great idea , but what I ' d like to say is that , in fact , this is a great metaphor for the way that ideas happen.
And that means that we have to change some of our models of what innovation and deep thinking really looks like , right.
You know , you ' re sitting there thinking a deep thought , and the apple falls from the tree , and you have the theory of gravity.
So , if we ' re trying to build organizations that are more innovative , we have to build spaces that -- strangely enough -- look a little bit more like this.
He went to a bunch of science labs around the world and videotaped everyone as they were doing every little bit of their job.
And  " oh , eureka, "  they ' ve got the idea.
The other problem that people have is they like to condense their stories of innovation down to kind of shorter time frames.
We ' ve heard a lot recently about hunch and instinct and blink-like sudden moments of clarity , but in fact , a lot of great ideas linger on , sometimes for decades , in the back of people ' s minds.
Darwin himself , in his autobiography , tells the story of coming up with the idea for natural selection as a classic  " eureka! "  moment.
About a decade or two ago , a wonderful scholar named Howard Gruber went back and looked at Darwin ' s notebooks from this period.
And so what you realize is that Darwin , in a sense , had the idea , he had the concept , but was unable of fully thinking it yet.
It will be useful in 2020.
And the other thing is to allow those hunches to connect with other people ' s hunches ; that ' s what often happens.
And I ' ll leave you with this story , which I think captures a lot of these values , and it ' s just wonderful kind of tale of innovation and how it happens in unlikely ways.
There are all these physics geeks who are there thinking ,  " Oh my gosh! This is incredible . I can ' t believe this has happened. " 
There ' s this , you know , man-made satellite up there in outer space that ' s obviously broadcasting some kind of signal.
And it turns out Weiffenbach is kind of an expert in microwave reception , and he ' s got a little antennae set up with an amplifier in his office.
So they made it really easy to find it.
We should record it. " 
We could probably calculate the speed that the satellite is traveling , if we do a little basic math here using the Doppler effect. " 
And eventually , they get permission -- this is all a little side project that hadn ' t been officially part of their job description.
You ' ve figured out an unknown location of a satellite orbiting the planet from a known location on the ground.
So they went back , and they thought about it.
And it ' s really hard to figure out how to get your missile so that it will land right on top of Moscow , if you don ' t know where the submarine is in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.
30 years later , Ronald Reagan actually opened it up and made it an open platform that anybody could kind of build upon and anybody could come along and build new technology that would create and innovate on top of this open platform , left it open for anyone to do pretty much anything they wanted with it.
When you build them right , they will be led to completely new directions that the creators never even dreamed of.

Eva Vertes looks to the future of medicine
My grandmother was on a train to Auschwitz , the death camp.
They were living in Hungary , and my mother was born.
So , to make a long story short , they came to Canada.
And I had never been a reader when I was young -- my dad had tried me with the Hardy Boys ; I tried Nancy Drew ; I tried all that -- and I just didn ' t like reading books.
I wanted to be like the explorers I ' d read about in the book , who went into the jungles of Africa , went into the research labs and just tried to figure out what this deadly virus was . So from that moment on , I read every medical book I could get my hands on , and I just loved it so much.
But I mean , why would they respond to a 14-year-old , anyway ? 
The spinal cord had breaks . The neurons were crossing in every which way.
And being naive about the whole field , I kind of thought ,  " Oh , you have cell death in Alzheimer ' s which is causing the memory deficit , and then you have this compound -- purine derivatives -- that are promoting cell growth. " 
And there I was awarded  " Best in the World in Medicine, "  which allowed me to get in , or at least get a foot in the door of the big medical world.
At first when I heard of cancer stem cells , I didn ' t really know how to put the two together . I ' d heard of stem cells , and I ' d heard of them as the panacea of the future -- the therapy of many diseases to come in the future , perhaps.
And it seemed that tumors actually begin from a stem cell.
If you drink , you damage your liver , and then liver cancer occurs.
And the cancer , the body is saying the lung tissue is damaged , we need to repair the lung . And cancer is originating in the lung trying to repair -- because you have this excessive proliferation of these remarkable cells that really have the potential to become lung tissue.
And I really think that we can ' t think about cancer -- let alone any disease -- in such black-and-white terms.
Shouldn ' t we think about manipulation , rather than elimination ? 
But it struck me that I ' d never heard of cancer of the heart , or cancer of any skeletal muscle for that matter.
And what metastases are is when the tumor -- when a piece -- breaks off and travels through the blood stream and goes to a different organ . That ' s what a metastasis is.
So the fact that not only did cancer not seem to originate in skeletal muscles , but cancer didn ' t seem to go to skeletal muscle -- there seemed to be something here.
Is there a reason for this ?  "  And a lot of the replies I got were that muscle is terminally differentiated tissue.
So I decided to ask why . And here ' s some of , I guess , my hypotheses that I ' ll be starting to investigate this May at the Sylvester Cancer Institute in Miami.
Some of my hypotheses are that when you first think about skeletal muscle , there ' s a lot of blood vessels going to skeletal muscle.
So first of all I thought , you know ,  " Wouldn ' t it be favorable to cancer getting to skeletal muscle ?  "  And as well , cancer tumors require a process called angiogenesis , which is really , the tumor recruits the blood vessels to itself to supply itself with nutrients so it can grow.
16 percent! Meaning that there were these pinpoint tumors in skeletal muscle , but only .16 percent of actual metastases -- suggesting that maybe skeletal muscle is able to control the angiogenesis , is able to control the tumors recruiting these blood vessels.
So this suggests that maybe if there is an anti-angiogenic factor in skeletal muscle -- or perhaps even more , an angiogenic routing factor , so it can actually direct where the blood vessels grow -- this could be a potential future therapy for cancer.
Is it possible that skeletal muscle doesn ' t express this type of molecules ? 
I mean , there are so many possibilities for why tumors don ' t go to skeletal muscle.
And what MyoD essentially does is , it causes cells to differentiate into muscle cells . So this compound , MyoD , has been tested on a lot of different cell types and been shown to actually convert this variety of cell types into skeletal muscle cells.
Muscle is constantly being used -- constantly being damaged.
But when the body is actually initiating a process and we ' re calling it a disease , it doesn ' t seem as though elimination is the right solution . So even to go from there , it ' s possible , although far-fetched , that in the future we could almost think of cancer being used as a therapy.
And again , some of these may be far-fetched , but I figured if there ' s anywhere to present far-fetched ideas , it ' s here at TED , so thank you very much.

In 1978 , I was working for Time magazine , and I was given a three-day assignment to photograph Amerasian children , children who had been fathered by American GIs all over Southeast Asia , and then abandoned -- 40,000 children all over Asia.
I was 28 years old.
And the grandmother had never let any Westerners ever see her.
And the guy just told me ,  " There ' s no way . This grandmother won ' t even -- you know , there ' s no way she ' s ever going to let you meet this girl that ' s she ' s raising. " 
I had a sleeping bag.
So there I was , I couldn ' t speak a word of Korean , and this is the first night I met Hyun-Sook.
The grandmother was incredibly fond , deeply in love with this little girl.
I had photographed , as I said , a lot of these kids.
And what struck me immediately in meeting Hyun-Sook was how confident she appeared to be , how happy she seemed to be in her own skin.
This is on the way to school.
Again , not at all shy or withdrawn , or anything like the other children that I ' d photographed.
And so , she really just completely ignored me most of the time.
And that ' s North Korea up along the hill.
Very often at school , I ' d be taking pictures , and she would whisper into her girlfriends '  ears , and then look at me and say ,  " Stop. " 
And I said to my translator ,  " What ' s going on , why is she crying ?  " 
And the translator said ,  " The grandmother says that she thinks she ' s dying , and she wants to know if you would take Hyun-Sook to America with you. " 
 " Sorry , I have to go on an assignment , I ' ll be back "  -- and then you never come back.
And so , when I got outside , I actually gave the translator some money and said ,  " Please go back and see if you can do something. " 
And my best friend had mistakenly one day said something about wishing he had another child.
So anyway , I left.
I figured I ' d come back in a couple of weeks and talk to the grandmother.
So , I went back to Korea , and I went back to Hyun-Sook ' s village , and she was gone.
And they had no idea about this request that she ' d made of me.
It was not a very nice area of Seoul , as there were mud streets outside of it.
And I said to the translator ,  " What did he say ?  " 
And she said ,  " He says he knows who you are , what do you want ?  " 
So I said ,  " Listen , it ' s really cold , I ' ve come a very long way , do you mind if I just come in for a minute ?  I ' m freezing. " 
I sort of had this picture of this incredibly wonderful , bright , happy little child , who now appeared to be very withdrawn , being enslaved by this family.
I was very worried about her.
Would you like to come and have lunch tomorrow ? 
And I said to them ,  " Look , there ' s a little girl who has a tiny chance of getting out of here and going to America. " 
So , these two came to lunch , and we got thrown out of the restaurant.
Here I was again , trying to figure out what to do.
Who the hell are you to accuse me of something like this ?  '  "  And I said , you know ,  " Look, "  I said ,  " You ' re absolutely right.
And I said ,  " Look , I will fly my friends over here from the United States if you want to meet them , to see if you approve of them.
And they actually take items of clothing and photographs , and they burn them as part of the ritual.
Well , there was an American Marine priest that I had met in the course of doing the story , who had 75 children living in his house.
So , this is on the way down to the orphanage.
Now , I had always thought she was completely untouched by all of this , because the grandmother , to me , appeared to be sort of the village wise woman , and the person everybody -- throughout the day , I noticed people kept coming to visit her grandmother.
He actually agreed to the adoption.
And there ' s clothes , and there ' s kids , and , you know , there ' s three adults and 75 kids -- you can imagine.
And he said ,  " She ' s telling me that I ' m messy , and I have to clean up my room. " 
So , it was a really big deal when the letters showed up.
And one of the things Father Keene told me when I came back from one of these trips -- Hyun-Sook had chosen the name Natasha , which I understood was from her watching a  " Rocky and Bullwinkle "  cartoon on the American Air Force station.
And they spent a lot of time huddled over a dictionary.
The uncle went back to his family , and Natasha and Tim and Gene and I went out to dinner.
The first night we ' d gotten a room for the kids right next to us.
And Gene and I looked at each other and said ,  " No , we don ' t want two 11-year-olds five floors away. " 
We ' re lying in bed , and Gene and I are talking about how cool we are.
And they always overheat the hotels in Korea terribly , so during the day I always left the window open.
So , sure enough , it ' s one o ' clock , room ' s freezing , I go to close the window , and I hear people shouting outside , and I thought ,  " Oh , the bars must have just gotten out. " 
And now there ' s smoke and flames coming by our windows -- we ' re on the eleventh floor.
And we can ' t talk to her.
And the whole room filled with smoke in about two seconds.
I just remember this unbelievable , just utter chaos.
Please , I just want to wake up , it ' s got to be a nightmare. " 
And Gene , who ' s lying on the floor , says ,  " Man , we ' ve got to soak towels. "  I said ,  " What ?  " 
I said ,  " What ?  "  He said ,  " Do you have gaffer ' s tape ?  " 
I mean , Gene -- thank God for Gene.
Eleven people ended up dying in the fire.
I didn ' t know who it was , I didn ' t know what they wanted , and Natasha could tell they were firemen trying to get us out.
People were lying on the floor.
It ' s so weird how life just goes on.
So , these are the greenhouse tents.
The adoption people told us it was going to take a year for the adoption to go through.
This is saying goodbye to everybody at the orphanage.
It was like the ultimate perk.
This is 28 hours later in Atlanta . It ' s a very long flight.
Gene and Gail know everyone in Atlanta -- they ' re the most social couple imaginable.
She never liked it very much.
This is her cooking teacher.
People were always telling Natasha how much she looks like her mother , Gail.
Now , a lot of parents , when they adopt , actually want to erase their children ' s history.
She hates this picture -- it was her first job.
Used to do their Christmas card every year.
This is her first trip back to Korea , so there ' s her uncle.
It ' s just , you know , it was just so interesting , just to watch -- this is her mother in the background there.
And there ' s Evan.
Natasha : I ' ve seen pictures millions of times , but today was the first time I ' m actually seeing him give the whole presentation.
RS : Anyway , thank you , Mike and Richard , so much for letting us tell the story.
astronomy,biology,life,technology,universe
My talk essentially got written by three historic events that happened within days of each other in the last two months -- seemingly unrelated , but as you will see , actually all having to do with the story I want to tell you today.
Now that was , ironically , and very befittingly , the way we found his grave.
The DNA matched , and we know that this was indeed Nicolaus Copernicus.
And at the time , people actually answered that question positively :  " Yes. " 
Are we alone ?  " 
Let ' s start with the old Copernican question : Are there earths around other stars ? 
The telescope is actually built similarly to the , well-known to you , Hubble Space Telescope , except it does have an additional lens -- a wide-field lens , as you would call it as a photographer.
Not all of the planets will be fortuitously oriented for us to be able do that , but if you have a million stars , you ' ll find enough planets.
But we learn a lot from that : not only that there is a planet there , but we also learn its size.
Well , let me try to walk you through what we actually see and so you understand the news that I ' m here to tell you today.
So we count many , many such planets , and they have different sizes.
Up until recently , that was the Solar System -- four Earth-like planets with small radius , smaller than about two times the size of the Earth -- and that was of course Mercury , Venus , Mars , and of course the Earth , and then the two big , giant planets.
So now we have Pluto to join the numbers of small planets.
Finally , 15 years ago , the technology came to the point where we could discover a planet around another star , and we actually did pretty well.
But you see , we haven ' t gone very far.
And we didn ' t have the evidence for that.
And now for the first time , we can say that.
But the statistical result is loud and clear.
Well , first of all , we can study them now that we know where they are.
It ' s about 100 million such planets.
We can find what they ' re made of , would their atmospheres have water , carbon dioxide , methane.
Why I ' m here is to tell you that the next step is really the exciting part.
I really mean life on Earth , past and present , from microbes to us humans , in its rich molecular diversity , the way we now understand life on Earth as being a set of molecules and chemical reactions -- and we call that , collectively , biochemistry , life as a chemical process , as a chemical phenomenon.
And that ' s a very basic question , which we don ' t know the answer to , but which we can try -- and we are trying -- to answer in the lab.
And a lot of the good news comes from that part of the bridge that we are trying to build as well.
But those bubbles have membranes very similar to the membrane of every cell of every living thing on Earth looks like , like this.
On one hand , on the left bank of the river , are the people like me who study those planets and try to define the environments.
So why should you care about that ? 
This understanding of chemistry actually can help us with our daily lives.
Now it ' s about something else , but it ' s equally profound.
And the bigger the telescope , the bigger that universe becomes.
It is seen from , in this case , from outside the orbit of Saturn.
The biosphere is the size of the Earth.
Would that make us more responsible for what is happening today ? 
Let me try it.
It is unimaginably small.
The universe and life are both in space and time.
This is very significant.
This tells us that that insignificance paradigm that we somehow got to learn from the Copernican principle , it ' s all wrong.
And the good news is we can actually , indeed do it.

Hans Rosling on HIV : New facts and stunning data visuals
And on this axis , I ' m showing dollars per person in income.
And , up there , you see Uganda.
Now you have understood the graph and now , in the next 60 seconds , we will play the HIV epidemic in the world.
First , we have the fast rise in Uganda and Zimbabwe.
Look , India got many infected , but had a low level.
25 years it took.
Now , let me make a fast replay of Botswana.
And if people who are infected are treated , they don ' t die of AIDS.
In spite of PEPFAR , the generous PEPFAR , all people are not reached by treatment , and of those who are reached by treatment in the poor countries , only 60 percent are left on treatment after two years.
It is only by stopping the transmission that the world will be able to deal with it.
I would say , HIV is very different in Africa.
We have to stop that.
And so it is in Africa -- it ' s a lot of difference.
And this is peaceful Zambia , neighboring country -- 15 percent.
Well if you look at the macro level , it seems more money , more HIV.
The difference goes from 11 percent down to four percent , and it is even bigger among women.
Look here at Kenya.
So , what is it then ? 
But where are they situated ? 
Look , you have bubbles all over the world here.
India has many because they are many.
UNAIDS have done good data available , finally , about the spread of HIV.
After all , if you are completely healthy and you have heterosexual sex , the risk of infection in one intercourse is one in 1,000.
And what is concurrency ? 
Vodka , Midsummer ' s Eve -- new partner for the fall.
HIV has a peak three to six weeks after infection and therefore , having more than one partner in the same month is much more dangerous for HIV than others.
We have uploaded UNAIDS data on the Gapminder site.
business,culture,economics,global issues
Let ' s talk about past and future billions.
And we also know that most of them were or are very poor -- did not live for very long.
19 percent of the world ' s population today , Westerners own two-thirds of its wealth.
One , the red line , is the ratio of British to Indian per capita income.
They start off pretty close together.
It ' s based on purchasing power parity.
If you take the 10 countries that went on to become the Western empires , in 1500 they were really quite tiny -- five percent of the world ' s land surface , 16 percent of its population , maybe 20 percent of its income.
One , empire was the least original thing that the West did after 1500.
In any case , as you may remember , the Great Divergence reaches its zenith in the 1970s , some considerable time after decolonization.
The same wind that carries them back would bring us thither ?  " 
He said it was  " because they have laws and rules invented by reason. " 
We took all the Germans , we divided them roughly in two , and we gave the ones in the East communism , and you see the result.
And the result is an even bigger divergence in a very short space of time than happened in Germany.
It ' s the institutions.
He was Adam Smith -- not Billy Connolly , not Sean Connery -- though he is very smart indeed.
 " China seems to have been long stationary , and probably long ago acquired that full complement of riches which is consistent with the nature of its laws and institutions.
But you know , this is a TED audience , and if I keep talking about institutions , you ' re going to turn off.
And they ' re kind of like the apps on your phone , in the sense that they look quite simple.
There are six which I think explain the Great Divergence.
Four , modern medicine.
Let me very briefly tell you what I mean by this , synthesizing the work of many economic historians in the process.
The scientific revolution was different from the science that had been achieved in the Oriental world in a number of crucial ways , the most important being that , through the experimental method , it gave men control over nature in a way that had not been possible before.
That really was a killer application.
Property rights : It ' s not the democracy , folks ; it ' s having the rule of law based on private property rights.
But at the end of it , you ' ve got a hundred acres of land.
Most people in rural North America owned some land by 1900.
And this was another killer app -- the very opposite of a killer , because it doubled , and then more than doubled , human life expectancy.
The empires weren ' t all bad.
That ' s the consumer society , and it propels economic growth more than even technological change itself.
Finally , the work ethic.
We know this because today the work ethic is no longer a Protestant , Western phenomenon.
Who ' s got the work ethic now ? 
and Albania and Tunisia.
Not only has Japan been ahead for some time , South Korea has gone into third place , and China is just about to overtake Germany.
Any society can adopt these institutions , and when they do , they achieve what the West achieved after 1500 -- only faster.
The average American used to be more than 20 times richer than the average Chinese.
The second question is , does the sequencing of the download matter ? 
And third , can China do without killer app number three ? 
He ' s now free again , having been detained , as you know , for some time.
It means that violence , the rule of warriors and despotic chiefs , the conditions of camps and warfare , of riot and tyranny , give place to parliaments where laws are made , and independent courts of justice in which over long periods those laws are maintained.
I don ' t think the decline of Western civilization is inevitable , because I don ' t think history operates in this kind of life-cycle model , beautifully illustrated by Thomas Cole ' s  " Course of Empire "  paintings.
Complex civilizations do that , because they operate , most of the time , on the edge of chaos.
Thanks very much.
I once asked one of my colleagues at Harvard ,  " Hey , is South America part of the West ?  " 
I think if you look at what is happening in Brazil in particular , but also Chile , which was in many ways the one that led the way in transforming the institutions of economic life , there ' s a very bright future indeed.
The Americans think that the European model is going to crumble tomorrow.
And it ' s a crisis that has its structural facet -- it ' s partly to do with demographics.
I think that ' s its real importance.

Spiders are truly global citizens.
This is a rugged and barren landscape , yet there are quite a few spiders here.
To put that number into perspective , here ' s a graph comparing the 40,000 species of spiders to the 400 species of primates.
So what this figure shows is that spiders date back to almost 380 million years.
Even fossil spiders can make silk , as we can see from this impression of a spinneret on this fossil spider.
There are many kinds of spider silk.
How does an individual spider make so many kinds of silk ? 
Hey! Don ' t laugh . That ' s my life.
Each of these silk fibers exits from the spigot , and if you were to trace the fiber back into the spider , what you would find is that each spigot connects to its own individual silk gland . A silk gland kind of looks like a sac with a lot of silk proteins stuck inside.
They differ by size , shape , and sometimes even color.
There ' s also aciniform silk , which is used to wrap prey.
But what , exactly , is spider silk ? 
They ' re very repetitive , and they ' re very rich in the amino acids glycine and alanine.
You can also see that there ' s a lot of short sequence motifs that repeat over and over and over again , so for example there ' s a lot of what we call polyalanines , or iterated A ' s , AAAAA . There ' s GGQ . There ' s GGY.
At the top of the screen , you ' re seeing the repeat unit from the dragline silk of a garden argiope spider.
What silk biologists do is we try to relate these sequences , these amino acid sequences , to the mechanical properties of the silk fibers.
Here are stress-strain curves generated by tensile testing five fibers made by the same spider.
On the other hand , if you were to look at strain -- this is how much a fiber can be extended -- if you look at the maximum value here , again , there ' s a lot of variation and the clear winner is flagelliform , or the capture spiral filament.
If it wasn ' t able to stretch so much , then basically when an insect hit the web , it would just trampoline right off of it.
That ' s what the spider has to interact with their environment.
Some of them are orb-weaving spiders and some of them are non-orb-weaving spiders.
If you look right here at the two red arrows , they point to the toughness values for the draglines of nephila clavipes and araneus diadematus.
This is the dragline spun by scytodes , the spitting spider.
We don ' t really know why scytodes needs such a tough dragline , but it ' s unexpected results like this that make bio-prospecting so exciting and worthwhile.
It ' s the combination of strength , extensibility and toughness that makes spider silk so special , and that has attracted the attention of biomimeticists , so people that turn to nature to try to find new solutions.
In addition to these biomimetic applications of spider silks , personally , I find studying spider silks just fascinating in and of itself.
The next time you see a spider web , please , pause and look a little closer.
In this prescient 2005 talk , Clay Shirky shows how closed groups and companies will give way to looser networks where small contributors have big roles and fluid cooperation replaces rigid planning.
How do groups get anything done ?  Right ? 
And we ' ve had a classic answer for coordination costs , which is , if you want to coordinate the work of a group of people , you start an institution , right ?  You raise some resources.
You found an institution , and you use the institution to coordinate the activities of the group.
So , I ' m going to start by trying to answer a question that I know each of you will have asked yourself at some point or other , and which the Internet is purpose-built to answer , which is , where can I get a picture of a roller-skating mermaid ? 
Colorful characters , and a good time is had by all.
Flickr is a photo-sharing service that allows people to take photos , upload them , share them over the Web and so forth.
Tagging is a cooperative infrastructure answer to classification.
And I was then able to go and retrieve them to give you that little slideshow.
How do we get those people together to contribute that work ? 
First of all , when you form an institution , you take on a management problem , right ? 
You have to have legal structure.
You notice we haven ' t got everybody who has a photo.
And fourth , as a result of that exclusion , you end up with a professional class . Look at the change here.
You arrange the coordination in the group , and by doing that you get the same outcome , without the institutional difficulties.
And this is a general aspect of these cooperative systems.
That is a point-to-point replacement of coordination with planning.
These are photos on Flickr tagged  " Iraq. " 
The photos are spread out over a longer period of time.
This is a graph of photographs tagged Iraq as taken by the 529 photographers who contributed the 5,445 photos.
And by the time we get around here , we get ten or fewer photos , and then there ' s this long , flat tail.
The math behind the power-law distribution is that whatever ' s in the nth position is doing about one-nth of whatever ' s being measured , relative to the person in the first position.
And curiously , in these systems , as they grow larger , the systems don ' t converge ; they diverge more.
If you go down to one percent , exclude 99 percent of the group effort , you ' re still accounting for almost a quarter of the photos.
This is the math underlying the 80/20 rule . Right ? 
And the 80 percent zone is a no-carrot and no-stick zone.
The cooperative infrastructure model says , why do you want to give up a quarter of the value ? 
So the coordination response asks not , how are these people as employees , but rather , what is their contribution like ?  Right ? 
The question is not , is Psycho Milt a good employee ? 
But when you ' re down here , where the Psycho Milts of the world are adding one photo at a time , that ' s institution as obstacle.
Right ?  So , when institutions are told they are obstacles , and that there are other ways of coordinating the value , they go through something a little bit like the Kubler-Ross stages -- -- of reaction , being told you have a fatal illness : denial , anger , bargaining , acceptance.
In France , a bus company is suing people for forming a carpool , right , because the fact that they have coordinated themselves to create cooperative value is depriving them of revenue.
Right ?  How do you capture that ? 
You can hear this distribution under that complaint.
The Psycho Milt question is , was it a good idea ? 
The fact that a single programmer can , without having to move into a professional relation to an institution , improve Linux once and never be seen from again , should terrify Ballmer.
The inventors don ' t know what the invention is.
So they ' re reinventing it , using these tools.
I think this is a revolution.
It ' s a whole new way of doing things , which includes new downsides.
This is happening , however , against the background of the rise of Web logging.
It is a one-button operation that you can do for free.
And the answer to that question is , it doesn ' t matter , because that ' s not the right question.
So as much as we want the shield laws , the background -- the institution to which they were attached -- is becoming incoherent.
They post pictures of thin models , which they call  " thinspiration. " 
We ' re used to support groups being beneficial.
Now , when the larger group is a bunch of drunks , and the small group wants to stay sober , then we think , that ' s a great support group.
So , there are significant downsides to these changes as well as upsides . And of course , in the current environment , one need allude only lightly to the work of non-state actors trying to influence global affairs , and taking advantage of these.
Right . As with the printing press , if it ' s really a revolution , it doesn ' t take us from Point A to Point B.
50 years in which loosely coordinated groups are going to be given increasingly high leverage , and the more those groups forego traditional institutional imperatives -- like deciding in advance what ' s going to happen , or the profit motive -- the more leverage they ' ll get.
It ' s going to be much more complicated than that.
Batch to batch , crust to crust .. . In tribute to the beloved staple food , baking master Peter Reinhart reflects on the cordial couplings that give us our daily bread . Try not to eat a slice.
This is a wheat bread , a whole wheat bread , and it ' s made with a new technique that I ' ve been playing around with , and developing and writing about which , for lack of a better name , we call the epoxy method.
And let ' s face it , everyone ' s trying to move towards whole grains.
It ' s mainly starch , and starch , when you break it down -- what is starch ?  It ' s -- thank you -- sugar , yes.
It ' s got germ . Those are the good things , but those aren ' t the tastiest parts of the wheat.
I call it the flavor rule . Flavor rules.
It ' s just dough that is wet.
That ' s what enzymes are doing.
The other pre-dough that we make is fermented -- our pre-ferment.
That ' s the challenge . Okay , so , now , what we -- in the journey of wheat , let ' s go back and look at these 12 stages.
Everyone who works in the culinary world knows that the first stage of cooking is  " mise en place, "  which is just a French way of saying ,  " get organized. " 
We have to develop the gluten.
And so we , in the mixing process , have to develop the gluten , we have to activate the leaven or the yeast , and we have to essentially distribute all the ingredients evenly.
And somehow , this is transformed -- the yeast burps and sweats are later transformed -- and this is really getting to the heart of what makes bread so special is that it is a transformational food , and we ' re going to explore that in a minute.
That ' s called  " rounding. " 
This takes a second , but it ' s a distinctive stage.
The final fermentation takes place in stage nine.
Three transformations take place in the oven.
Inside , the proteins -- this gluten -- coagulates.
Coagulation , caramelization and gelatinization -- when the starch is thick and they absorb all the moisture that ' s around them , they -- they kind of swell , and then they burst.
And stage 11 , we call it cooling -- because we never really eat the bread right away.
And so , we ' re going to be on our own journey today from wheat to eat , and in a few minutes we will try this , and see if we have succeeded in fulfilling this baker ' s mission of pulling out flavor.
In fact , Dante says you can ' t understand the three deeper levels unless you first understand the literal level , so that ' s why we ' re talking literally about bread.
But what ' s wheat ?  Wheat is a grass that grows in the field.
It ' s just a euphemism for killing , right ? 
Now , wheat is alive , and as we harvest it , it gives up its seeds.
But most of those seeds get crushed and turned into flour.
So as I said , I think bread is a transformational food.
That ' s a transformation , two different things.
And what do we do ?  We add some water.
And we infuse that clay with an ingredient that we call  " leaven. " 
You see , the baker , in this moment , has become , in a sense , sort of , the God of his dough , you know , and his dough , well , while it ' s not an intelligent life form , is now alive.
Yeast is eating sugar and turning it into carbon dioxide and alcohol.
A subtle change in temperature -- a subtle change in time -- it ' s all about a balancing act between time , temperature and ingredients . That ' s the art of baking.
And at stage 10 , we take it to the oven.
Students love that TDP . They think it ' s the name of a video game.
It ' s starting to make sense to me -- what goes in is dough , what comes out is bread -- or it goes in alive , comes out dead.
Or another analogy would be , a caterpillar has been turned into a butterfly.
It ' s used as a symbol for transformation.
And what we ' re going to attempt to do with this bread here , again , is to use , in addition to everything we talked about , this bread we ' re going to call  " spent grain bread "  because , as you know , bread-making is very similar to beer-making.
But we ' ve got this bread , and what I did here is to try to , again , evoke even more flavor from this grain , was we ' ve added into it the spent grain from beer-making.
We ' re going to take some of that , and put it into the bread.
We ' ll start a little piece here , and I ' m going to take a little piece here -- I think I ' d better taste it myself before you have it at lunch.
Mark Applebaum writes music that breaks the rules in fantastic ways , composing a concerto for a florist and crafting a musical instrument from junk and found objects . This quirky talk might just inspire you to shake up the “rules” of your own creative work.
I thought if I skipped it might help my nerves , but I ' m actually having a paradoxical reaction to that , so that was a bad idea.
And I ' m going to share my music with you , but I hope that I ' m going to do so in a way that tells a story , tells a story about how I used boredom as a catalyst for creativity and invention , and how boredom actually forced me to change the fundamental question that I was asking in my discipline , and how boredom also , in a sense , pushed me towards taking on roles beyond the sort of most traditional , narrow definition of a composer.
No , no , I didn ' t write that.
But we can ask the question ,  " But is it music ?  " 
I mean , you — I ' m just like , a hush , huh -- It ' s like -- It ' s Beethoven , how can you say that ? 
In fact , I think it ' s not better than it . The thing is -- -- it ' s more interesting to me . It ' s less boring for me.
It gets a little bit boring , and so pretty soon I go through other instruments , they become familiar , and eventually I find myself designing and constructing my own instrument , and I brought one with me today , and I thought I would play a little bit on it for you so you can hear what it sounds like.
I can actually do all sorts of things . I can play with a violin bow . I don ' t have to use the chopsticks.
And so forth.
So in that regard , this is one of the things , this is one of the privileges of being , and here ' s another role , the inventor , and by the way , when I told you that I ' m the world ' s greatest , if you ' re keeping score , we ' ve had narcissism and solipsism and now a healthy dose of egocentricism.
I ' m glad I ' m past that . We ' re not going to go into that.
Now , some of my scores as a composer look like this , and others look like this , and some look like this , and I make all of these by hand , and it ' s really tedious.
This is an excerpt from a score called  " The Metaphysics of Notation. " 
Now this was a really exciting experience for me.
So one of the things is that , I mean , some people would say , like ,  " Oh , you ' re being a dilettante, "  and maybe that ' s true . I can understand how , I mean , because I don ' t have a pedigree in visual art and I don ' t have any training , but it ' s just something that I wanted to do as an extension of my composition , as an extension of a kind of creative impulse.
I took the Copenhagen subway map and I renamed all the stations to abstract musical provocations , and the players , who are synchronized with stopwatches , follow the timetables , which are listed in minutes past the hour.
I made my own faces , and had a company fabricate them , and the players follow these scores.
And once again , this is , for me , interesting.
Let ' s watch a little bit of this , and please notice the instrumentation.
This is  " Tlön, "  for three conductors and no players.
You ' re going to notice a lot of conventional instruments in this clip.
It ' s better with a florist , right ? 
Okay ?  But then there was this other stuff , right ? 
I recorded an awesome singer , and I took the sound of his voice in my computer , and I warped it in countless ways to come up with the soundtrack that you ' re about to hear.
Is it music ?  Here ' s how I want to conclude.
not worrying about the definition of the thing that I ' m making.
http://www.ted.com/talks/alison_gopnik_what_do_babies_think.html
Alison Gopnik : What do babies think ? 
So in some ways , we think that this baby ' s thinking is like the thinking of the most brilliant scientists.
And maybe the hardest thing of all is to figure out that what other people think and feel isn ' t actually exactly like what we think and feel.
Babies , after all , can ' t talk , and if you ask a three year-old to tell you what he thinks , what you ' ll get is a beautiful stream of consciousness monologue about ponies and birthdays and things like that.
Now all of the babies , even in Berkley , like the crackers and don ' t like the raw broccoli.
But half the time , what she would do is take a little bit of the broccoli and go ,  " Mmmmm , broccoli.
So she ' d act as if what she wanted was just the opposite of what the babies wanted.
And the remarkable thing was that 18 month-old babies , just barely walking and talking , would give her the crackers if she liked the crackers , but they would give her the broccoli if she liked the broccoli.
The first one is that these little 18 month-old babies have already discovered this really profound fact about human nature , that we don ' t always want the same thing.
And this is just one of hundreds and hundreds of studies over the last 20 years that ' s actually demonstrated it.
And actually in many ways , they ' re worse than useless , because we have to put so much time and energy into just keeping them alive.
On one side is a New Caledonian crow.
On the other hand , we have our friend the domestic chicken.
They depend on their moms to drop worms in their little open mouths for as long as two years , which is a really long time in the life of a bird.
Well what kind of explanation could we have for this ? 
And of course , we human beings are way out on the end of the distribution like the crows.
My son is 23.
And that one big disadvantage is that , until you actually do all that learning , you ' re going to be helpless.
So the idea is that we have this early period when we ' re completely protected.
So they ' re the protected blue sky guys who just have to go out and learn and have good ideas , and we ' re production and marketing.
And in fact , the baby ' s brain seems to be the most powerful learning computer on the planet.
And essentially what Bayes did was to provide a mathematical way using probability theory to characterize , describe , the way that scientists find out about the world.
Then they test that new hypothesis and so on and so forth.
So if you want to know what ' s going on underneath those beautiful brown eyes , I think it actually looks something like this.
Because after all , if you ask even grownups about statistics , they look extremely stupid.
And using this very simple machine , my lab and others have done dozens of studies showing just how good babies are at learning about the world.
Because if you wave a block over the top of the detector , something you wouldn ' t ever think of to begin with , the detector will actually activate two out of three times.
So we did just this ; we gave four year-olds this pattern of evidence , and we just asked them to make it go.
They ' re just learning how to count.
So in these circumstances , the children are using statistics to find out about the world , but after all , scientists also do experiments , and we wanted to see if children are doing experiments.
What Cristine did was use our Blicket Detectors.
Same as the other side.
Boy : What ' s making this light up.
AG : Okay , hypothesis two.
He told the experimenter to do this , to try putting it out onto the other location.
AG : Okay , that ' s a fourth hypothesis.
AG : Okay,there ' s his fifth hypothesis.
Well , what ' s it like to be this kind of creature ? 
I think babies and children are actually more conscious than we are as adults.
Our consciousness of that thing that we ' re attending to becomes extremely bright and vivid , and everything else sort of goes dark.
If we look at babies and young children , we see something very different.
And if you actually look in their brains , you see that they ' re flooded with these neurotransmitters that are really good at inducing learning and plasticity , and the inhibitory parts haven ' t come on yet.
Well if we want to think about a way of getting a taste of that kind of baby consciousness as adults , I think the best thing is think about cases where we ' re put in a new situation that we ' ve never been in before -- when we fall in love with someone new , or when we ' re in a new city for the first time.
It ' s like being in love in Paris for the first time after you ' ve had three double-espressos.
It ' s good to be a grownup.
http://www.ted.com/talks/torsten_reil_studies_biology_to_make_animation.html
Torsten Reil builds better animations
Now , before I talk more about that technology , let ' s have a quick look at what human characters look like at the moment in computer games.
It ' s one of the most successful games of all time.
And you can see he looks always the same.
So , he or she sits down , animates it , and tries to anticipate what ' s going to happen , and then these particular animations are just played back at appropriate times in the computer game.
There ' s no real emergence there.
If I push Chris a bit , like this , for example , he ' ll react to it.
Thank you very much . Chris Anderson : That ' s it ? 
What we tried to do was teach a stick figure how to walk.
The tricky bit is now to put an AI controller in it that actually makes it work.
For that we used artificial evolution -- genetic algorithms.
At the beginning , they ' re all going to be very boring.
So that was the idea behind this.
So , it was back to the drawing board for us.
At the beginning , it can ' t walk at all , but it will get better and better over time.
But now , after generation 20 , it actually walks in a straight line without falling over.
What you see here is the character standing there , and there ' s an obstacle that we put in its way.
Now , what you see , by the way , at the top there , are some of the neural activations being fed into the virtual muscles.
What we really wanted was a full human body.
So we put quite a bit of biomechanical knowledge into this thing , and tried to make it as realistic as possible.
Nothing really interesting , basically.
So , this character now has motor skills in the upper body -- nothing in the legs yet , in this particular one.
It ' s going to turn around into the fall , and try and catch the fall.
I ' m going to push it a bit harder now , harder than I just pushed Chris.
And then , finally hits the floor.
What this is now is a real simulation . That ' s what I want to show you now.
Now , the angle will have changed a tiny bit , so you can see that the reaction is different.
That was really exciting for us to see that.
Now , just a fun thing : what happens if you put that character -- this is now a wooden version of it , but it ' s got the same AI in it -- but if you put that character on a slippery surface , like ice.
We just took this character that I just talked about , put it on a slippery surface , and this is what you get out of it.
Because stunts are obviously very dangerous , they ' re very expensive , and there are a lot of stunt scenes that you cannot do , obviously , because you can ' t really allow the stuntman to be seriously hurt.
That ' s what people want . That ' s what we ' re giving them.
You feel kind of sorry for that thing , and we ' ve seen it so many times now that we don ' t really care any more.
So that you don ' t have a character that looks limp , but actually a character that you can use in an action film straight away , that looks kind of alive in midair as well.
And let ' s just have a look at a slightly different visualization.
Animators had to actually animate them.
You can run this simulation in real time , in front of your eyes , change it , if you want to , and you get the animation straight out of it.
It ' s a very simple behavior that shows you the power of this approach.
It ' s even worse -- and that is another video I just got last night -- if you render that a bit more realistically.
Got a very short clip here.
Now , we ' ve just tried and -- looked at our character and asked ourselves ,  " Can we do that ourselves as well ?  " 
Now , this could do with a bit more work . It ' s still very early stages , and we pretty much just did this for a laugh , just to see what we ' d get out of it.
There ' s so many things we can do with this right now.
With this technology , video games will look different and they will feel very different.
But I particularly am really excited about using this technology in online worlds , like there , for example , that Tom Melcher has shown us.
As you probably know , it ' s very difficult to predict what the outcome of an operation is if you try and correct the gait.
That ' s one project we ' re particularly excited about , and that ' s going to start next month.
The body yes , but not all the motor skills that we have.
This was an AI contour that was produced and evolved -- half-evolved , I should say -- to produce balance , basically.
Bizarrely , this thing doesn ' t have a head . I ' m not quite sure why.
And what you see after a while -- I think he even goes into a climax right at the end.
So it ' s just -- Thanks.

Raghava KK : Shake up your story
It ' s a children ' s book for the iPad.
You can tickle the rug.
You can draw , as everyone should.

Shake it , and you have a heterosexual couple.
Basically , I was brought up to be a good Samaritan , and I am.
I remember we cried profusely when the little goats we played with in the summer became biriani.
Babri Masjid -- one of the most beautiful mosques in India , built by King Babur , I think , in the 16th century -- was demolished by Hindu activists.
You know the Hindus are killing us Muslims . Be careful. " 
Even in my gallery shows , I try and revisit historic events like Babri Masjid , distill only its emotional residue and image my own life.
It ' s a children ' s book about Indian independence -- very patriotic.
Even my books on children have cute , fuzzy animals.
And my argument [is] that the only way for us to teach creativity is by teaching children perspectives at the earliest stage.
You know , I can ' t promise my child a life without bias -- we ' re all biased -- but I promise to bias my child with multiple perspectives.

I ignored my boss '  warning . I called on a Monday morning.
I punched every touch tone I was told , but I still spent 18 hours on hold.
Blood comes gushing from your gashes . With your fading strength , you call 9-1-1 and you pray for a trained MD . But you get me.
Every week it ' ll arrive at your door.
The job , though , came with one small downside . And that is : they intended to publish my email address at the end of every column.
People are feeling overwhelmed . They ' re feeling like it ' s too much technology too fast.
And man , let me tell you , whoever figures out how to make money off of this frustration will -- oh , how did that get up there ?  Just kidding.
Over the years it ' s gotten easier to use.
You couldn ' t put the Mac OS 10 logo in 211k!
And the calls that -- you know how they say ,  " Your call may be recorded for quality assurance ?  " 
It ' s in your TEDGift Bag . No , no.
And the technician said ,  " Well , ma ' am , what do you mean your mouse is squeaking ?  " 
Another one , a guy called -- this is absolutely true! -- his computer had crashed , and he told the technician he couldn ' t restart it no matter how many times he typed 11.
So it gets to be more and more of a challenge.
And every year , they say ,  " We ' ve added more features and we ' ll sell it to you for $99. " 
I mean , Microsoft Word was last just a word processor in , you know , the Eisenhower administration.
And it came out . It was called Microsoft Write.
They don ' t need the database and the website , but they ' re like ,  " Well , I ' ll upgrade , because , I might , you know , I might need that someday. " 
But if you ' re not careful about how you choose , you wind up with this.
The off switch is in there somewhere.
There are only four choices , so why are they in a pop-up menu ? 
Thank you -- yes , I designed the dialog box . No , no , no.
And you know , there ' s a new version of Windows coming out this fall.
So there is a limit that we don ' t want to cross . So what is the answer ? 
I ' m going to give you some examples where intelligence makes something not consistent , but it ' s better.
It ' s mainly , like , the United States , Europe and Japan.
Here ' s another pet one of mine : you have a printer.
And one of the buttons at the bottom , you ' ll notice , is not  " Print. " 
He says ,  " Nice talk. "  And I said ,  " Thank you , what do you do here ?  " 
This is Microsoft Word . When you want to create a new blank document in Word -- it could happen!
That is a company not counting taps.

You can ' t keep a good idea down these days.
Big mediocrity in every way.
But actually , I believe there are really two Microsofts.
I liked the Media Center PC . I liked the Microsoft SPOT Watch.
So is there any hope ?  The screens are getting smaller.
It won ' t be easy . You ' ll think I ' m strange.
You try rhyming with garage!
I made a fortune over at Pixar.
People did not think it was worth putting a price on it.
They had voice recorders and FM transmitters.
And there are signs that the industry is getting the message.
When you have a digital camera , how do you get the pictures back to your computer ? 
Here ' s another example . Chris , you ' re the source of all power.
And I ' m sure every one of you has done this at some point in your lives , or one of your children . You walk along -- and I ' m about to pull this onto the floor . I don ' t care . It ' s a loaner.
Like , I get hundreds of them a day . Period.
Okay , this is not an ideal situation , because it ' s getting the echo from the hall and stuff.
So the point is , this a really interesting story.
Because for years people had bought this software , tried it out -- 95 percent accuracy was all they got , which means one in 20 words is wrong -- and they put it in their drawer . And the company got sick of that , so they said ,  " This version , we ' re not going to do anything but make sure it ' s darned accurate. " 
Be aware in life of good design and bad design.

Bill Joy : What I ' m worried about , what I ' m excited about
You ' d think maybe antibiotics made more difference than clean water , but it ' s actually the opposite.
We came up with something -- the Ten Commandments : Thou shalt not kill.
And then , to have to deal with large groups , say , at the nation-state level , and we had to have mutual non-aggression , or through a series of conflicts , we eventually came to a rough international bargain to largely keep the peace.
We saw genome sequences.
So individuals in small groups super-empowered by access to these kinds of self-replicating technologies , whether it be biological or other , are clearly a danger in our world.
And in this case , piling on more technology doesn ' t solve the problem , because it only super-empowers people more.
We get our individual rights by society protecting us from others not doing everything they can do but largely doing only what is legal.
So these are the kind of thoughts I was thinking in 1999 and 2000 , and my friends told me I was getting really depressed , and they were really worried about me.
I got up the next morning and walked out of the city , and all the sanitation trucks were parked on Houston Street and ready to go down and start taking the rubble away.
And everyone then started writing about this.
And I would say that we can ' t give up the rule of law to fight an asymmetric threat , which is what we seem to be doing because of the present , the people that are in power , because that ' s to give up the thing that makes civilization.
Things where , you know , a factor of 10 difference can make a factor of 1,000 difference in the outcome.
The first is this whole area of education , and it really relates to what Nicholas was talking about with a $100 computer.
Now , just imagine what that $100 computer will be in 2020 as a tool for education.
I remember when they took the Apple Mac interface and they put it back on the Apple II.
It ' s great that we have initiatives to say , let ' s go create the education and educate people in the world , because that ' s a great force for peace.
The thing that we see as the kind of Moore ' s Law trend that ' s driving improvement in our ability to address the environmental problem is new materials.
We ' ve made improvements in energy and resource efficiency , but the consumer sector , especially in America , is very inefficient.
And these are the kinds of things we ' re going to discover as we start to engineer at the nano scale.
And if you make a three-dimensional structure , like a buckyball , they have all sorts of incredible properties.
If you put electricity on them , they emit light.
If you put particles in them , and they go shooting out the tip -- they ' re like miniature linear accelerators or electron guns.
I had one business plan where I was trying to learn more about Witten ' s cosmic dimension strings to try to understand what the phenomenon was going on in this proposed nanomaterial.
Ethanol -- new ways of making ethanol.
We believe that Genentech , the Compaq , the Lotus , the Sun , the Netscape , the Amazon , the Google in these fields are yet to be found , because this materials revolution will drive these things forward.

It ' s especially hard for the scientists to accept who still remember , you know , Galileo essentially locked up , and who are still fighting this battle against the church.
Can happiness be bought ?  To find out , author Benjamin Wallace sampled the world ' s most expensive products , including a bottle of 1947 Chateau Cheval Blanc , 8 ounces of Kobe beef and the fabled Kopi Luwak coffee . His critique may surprise you.
I ' m just going to play a brief video clip.
Château Lafitte is one of the greatest wines in the world , the prince of any wine cellar.
Some workmen in Paris had broken through a brick wall , and happened upon this hidden cache of wines -- apparently the property of Thomas Jefferson . 1787 , 1784.
Bill Koch is a Florida billionaire who owns four of the Jefferson bottles , and he became suspicious.
I think they wanted to believe that the most expensive bottle of wine in the world must be the best bottle of wine in the world , must be the rarest bottle of wine in the world.
This was the first one.
I went there , and I ordered the eight-ounce rib eye for 160 dollars.
And then I took a bite , and I wished that it was tinier , because Kobe beef is so rich.
Now , the photographer who took the pictures for this project for some reason posed his dog in a lot of them , so that ' s why you ' re going to see this recurring character.
To try this , I went to a Mario Batali restaurant in Manhattan -- Del Posto.
It ' s in the smell.
There were several -- several of these items were disappointments.
And this hotel suite is 4,300 square feet.
It comes with its own Rolls Royce and driver.
This is soap that ' s made from silver nanoparticles , which have antibacterial properties.
These ones GQ did spring for -- I own these -- but I will tell you , not only did I not get a compliment from any of you , I have not gotten a compliment from anybody in the months that I have owned and worn these.
But no compliments.
He uses tiny bottles , the glass is tinted , he tops the olive oil off with an inert gas.
It was very green , it was very peppery.
I don ' t play golf , so I couldn ' t actually road test these , but I did interview a guy who owns them.
Oh , yeah , you know this one ? 
And apparently it ' s a very picky eater and it , you know , hones in on only the ripest coffee cherries.
There is now a toilet that has an MP3 player in it.
This one does not have those bells and whistles , but for pure functionality it ' s pretty much the best -- the Neorest 600.
There ' s a water jet that cleans you.
Not only is it a technological leap forward , but I really do believe it ' s a bit of a cultural leap forward.
Tom Cruise supposedly owns this bed.
But anyway , we had a great night ' s sleep.
This is the fastest street-legal car in the world and the most expensive production car.
It was such a smooth ride.
And if I was a billionaire , I would get one.
There was one object that I could not get my hands on , and that was the 1947 Cheval Blanc.
And just together , that vintage and that chateau took on this aura that eventually kind of gave it this cultish following.
Not that many people are looking to pop open their one remaining bottle for a journalist.
Bipin Desai is a U.C . Riverside theoretical physicist who also happens to be the preeminent organizer of rare wine tastings , and he said ,  " I ' ve got a tasting coming up where we ' re going to serve the  ' 47 Cheval Blanc. " 
It was three days , four meals.
There were people at my table who thought it was , you know , fantastic.
And it wasn ' t just to that wine.
And they gave subjects the same wine , labeled with different price tags.
So the Mars Rovers didn ' t scoop up any alien lifeforms . Scientist Penelope Boston thinks there ' s a good chance -- a 25 to 50 percent chance , in fact -- that life might exist on Mars , deep inside the planet ' s caves . She details how we should look and why.
The career that I started early on in my life was looking for exotic life forms in exotic places , and at that time I was working in the Antarctic and the Arctic , and high deserts and low deserts.
Many of them are trying to kill us from the minute we go into them , but nevertheless , they ' re absolutely gripping , and contain unbelievable biological wonders that are very , very different from those that we have on the planet.
I ' m very passionately interested in the human future , on the Moon and Mars particularly , and elsewhere in the solar system.
Something I never talk about in scientific meetings is how I actually got to this state and why I do the work that I do.
And a tremendous amount of money went into the funding of science and mathematics skills for kids.
The next element is the fact that I have applied a value judgment and my value judgment is that the presence of life is better than no life.
And that took what had been a tiny little astronomical object in the sky , that you would see as a dot , and turned it completely into a landscape , as that very first primitive picture came rastering across the screen.
So , wonderful things and grim things.
We ' re getting ready to begin to go through the process of leaving our planet of origin and out into the wider solar system and beyond.
So , finding life on another planet is a non-trivial occupation and we spend a lot of time trying to think about that.
Certainly , in the last 15 years , we ' ve seen increasing numbers of planets outside of our solar system being confirmed , and just last month , a couple of weeks ago , a planet in the size-class of Earth has actually been found.
And those planetary systems are going to be very common.
I was once sneeringly introduced by a former NASA official , as the only person on the planet who still thought there was life on Mars.
The amazing Pathfinder mission that went in  ' 97 , and the MER Rover missions that are on Mars as we speak now and the European Space Agency ' s Mars Express , has taught us a number of amazing things.
So , with all of these things put together , I think that the chances of life are much greater than I would ' ve ever thought.
So the game ' s afoot , and this is the game that we play in astro-biology.
Because if it ' s big and obvious , we would ' ve already found it -- it would ' ve already bitten us on the foot , and it hasn ' t.
So why might it be hard to find ? 
It also may be very , very different in its fundamental properties – its chemistry , or its size.
And speed of activity , which is something that we face in our work with sub-surface organisms , because they grow very , very slowly.
But the real issue is that we are guided by our limited experience , and until we can think out of the box of our cranium and what we know , then we can ' t recognize what to look for , or how to plan for it.
I always turn my head on the side , and that simple change makes me go from seeing this planet as home , to seeing it as a planet.
This is Cueva de Villa Luz in Tabasco , in Mexico , and this cave is saturated with sulfuric acid.
So , it ' s a very hazardous environment , with CO as well , and many other gases.
It ' s bursting with life.
But one of the most famous objects out of this are what we call Snottites , for obvious reasons.
And yet , everything in this cave has adapted to it.
In some of the other amazing caves that we work in -- this is in Lechuguilla cave in New Mexico near Carlsbad , and this is one of the most famous caves in the world.
This is the breakdown product of the bedrock , that organisms are busy munching their way through.
Interestingly enough , they also do this with uranium and chromium , and various other toxic metals.
Well , even in basalt surfaces in lava-tube caves , which are a by-product of volcanic activity , we find these walls totally covered , in many cases , by these beautiful , glistening silver walls , or shiny pink or shiny red or shiny gold.
The sub-surface of Earth contains a vast biodiversity.
We know that on Mars and the Moon there are tons of these structures.
These are all over the planet Mars , and we ' re busy cataloguing them now.
It requires crawling , climbing , rope-work , technical rope-work and many other complex human motions in order to access these.
And then , secondly , getting back to that earlier point that I made about the preciousness of any life that we may find on Mars , we don ' t want to contaminate it.
I want to talk specifically about the array that you see on the top.
They behave with a swarm behavior , where they relate to each other , modeled after insect swarm behavior , and they could be made very numerous.
And so , that allows you the flexibility to go into very challenging terrain and actually make your way where you want to go.
So , we have just finished a NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts Phase II study , looking at the irreducible set of technologies that you would need in order to actually allow people to inhabit lava tubes on the Moon or Mars.
And right now we ' re in caves , and we ' re doing science and recreation , but I think in the future we ' ll be using them for habitat and science on these other bodies.
Did life start here and was it transported there ? 
After hitting on a brilliant new life plan , our first instinct is to tell someone , but Derek Sivers says it ' s better to keep goals secret . He presents research stretching as far back as the 1920s to show why people who talk about their ambitions may be less likely to achieve them.
Everyone , please think of your biggest personal goal.
Imagine telling someone that you meet today what you ' re going to do.
Well , bad news : you should have kept your mouth shut , because that good feeling now will make you less likely to do it.
But when you tell someone your goal and they acknowledge it , psychologists have found that it ' s called a  " social reality. " 
So , let ' s look at the proof.
It goes like this : 163 people across four separate tests -- everyone wrote down their personal goal.
But those who had announced it quit after only 33 minutes , on average , and when asked afterwards , said that they felt much closer to achieving their goal.
But if you do need to talk about something , you can state it in a way that gives you no satisfaction , such as ,  " I really want to run this marathon , so I need to train five times a week and kick my ass if I don ' t , okay ?  " 
Co-creator of the philanthropic FEED bags , Ellen Gustafson says hunger and obesity are two sides of the same coin . At TEDxEast , she launches The 30 Project -- a way to change how we farm and eat in the next 30 years , and solve the global food inequalities behind both epidemics.
I ' m Ellen , and I ' m totally obsessed with food.
Especially if you ' re hungry and your kids are hungry and your neighbor ' s kids are hungry and your whole neighborhood is hungry , you ' re pretty angry.
It ' s called School Feeding , and it ' s a really simple idea to sort of get in the middle of the cycle of poverty and hunger that continues for a lot of people around the world , and stop it.
But each bag we ' d sell would provide a year ' s worth of school meals for one kid.
And we thought , God , this is such a good idea and it ' s going to raise so much money.
So FEED ' s doing great . We ' ve so far provided 55 million meals to kids around the world by selling now 550,000 bags , a ton of bags , a lot of bags.
 " What are you doing for America ' s kids ?  " 
But obviously the bigger problem that we all know about is obesity , and it ' s dramatic.
The numbers are pretty crazy.
And when you think about food , the underpinning of food in both cases is potentially problematic agriculture.
Well , the foods that are produced are , more or less , corn , soy and wheat.
So somehow we ' re not making the connect between exporting a good agricultural system that will help feed people all around the world.
And their farms are also large.
I think it ' s really interesting to look at agriculture from these two sides.
And in America , a lot of what we eat has led to obesity and has led to a real change in sort of what our diet is in the last 30 years.
But people do because it ' s so cheap , and so our whole food system in the last 30 years has really shifted.
Not to beat a dead horse , but this is a global food system where there ' s a billion people hungry and billion people obese.
The thing is , I ' ve learned -- and the technology people that are here , which I ' m totally not one of them -- but apparently , it really takes 30 years for a lot of technologies to become really endemic to us , like the mouse and the Internet and Windows.
You know , I think if we really think that this is something that ' s happened in the last 30 years , there ' s hope in that.
The icons like Michael Pollan and Jamie Oliver in his TED Prize wish both addressed this last three-decade time period as incredibly relevant for food system change.
And we know what ' s happened in the past , so if we start now , and we look at technologies and improvements to the food system long term , we might be able to recreate the food system so when I give my next talk and I ' m 60 years old , I ' ll be able to say that it ' s been a success.
We all tend to think that these systems are quite different , and people argue whether or not organic can feed the world , but if we take a 30-year view , there ' s more hope in collaborative ideas.
Another thing that ' s become incredibly global is production of meat and fish.
Well , if that bag of chips then becomes inherently more expensive than an apple , then maybe it ' s time for a different sense of personal responsibility in food choice because the choices are actually choices instead of three-quarters of the products being made just from corn , soy and wheat.

Tom Chatfield : 7 ways games reward the brain
But I think , above all , I ' m in awe at their power to motivate , to compel us , to transfix us , like really nothing else we ' ve ever invented has quite done before.
From about 10 billion in 1990 , it ' s worth 50 billion dollars globally today , and it shows no sign of slowing down.
The thing that really amazes me is that , today , people spend about eight billion real dollars a year buying virtual items that only exist inside video games.
And this virtual object takes 200 real people about 56 days of real time to build , plus countless thousands of hours of effort before that.
But we ' re here for the good news , and the good news is that I think we can explore why this very real human effort , this very intense generation of value , is occurring.
Now if we look at what ' s going on in someone ' s head when they are being engaged , two quite different processes are occurring.
It ' s a really great image . It ' s pretty cool.
It gives you great powers.
But this isn ' t the really interesting stuff.
The biggest games in the world today are measuring more than one billion points of data about their players , about what everybody does -- far more detail than you ' d ever get from any website.
Now , to try and explain this in sort of real terms , I want to talk about a kind of task that might fall to you in so many games.
Now you can think about this , if you like , as a problem about boxes.
Now , if you take a game like Warcraft , you can think about it , if you like , as a great box-opening effort.
Let ' s think about probability.
But of course , that ' s not all you do -- there ' s 15 pies.
You find that -- you know , between five and 20 is about the right number for keeping people going.
In most adventure games , it ' s a little bit in-game currency , a little bit experience.
There ' s going to be a 0.1 percent chance you get an absolutely awesome item.
So I ' m drawn on . It ' s not too easy , not too difficult.
We notice , looking at all these people opening boxes , that when people get to about 13 out of 15 pies , their perception shifts , they start to get a bit bored , a bit testy.
If they ' re real boxes , there ' s not much we can do , but in a game we can just say ,  " Right , well.
And one thing they certainly do at the moment is if you got a 0.1 percent awesome item , they make very sure another one doesn ' t appear for a certain length of time to keep the value , to keep it special.
So what does all this mean in practice ? 
It ' s the simple idea that instead of grading people incrementally in little bits and pieces , you give them one profile character avatar which is constantly progressing in tiny , tiny , tiny little increments which they feel are their own.
You say , it ' s about doing 10 of these questions , but another task is turning up to 20 classes on time , but another task is collaborating with other people , another task is showing you ' re working five times , another task is hitting this particular target.
Every time you do something , you get credit ; you get a credit for trying.
This is absolutely crucial , and virtuality is dazzling at delivering this.
But if you can model things for people , if you can give things to people that they can manipulate and play with and where the feedback comes , then they can learn a lesson , they can see , they can move on , they can understand.
And if you think about using this in testing , in just introducing control elements of randomness in all forms of testing and training , you can transform the levels of people ' s engagement by tapping into this very powerful evolutionary mechanism.
It ' s associated with reward-seeking behavior.
The first has to do with memory , that we can find these moments.
But you know , sort of  " our brains have been manipulated ; we ' re all addicts. " 
This is what really excites us.
That ' s a problem because they dropped two or three decent items.
They tracked these on a separate website.
This is a player-developed , self-enforcing , voluntary currency , and it ' s incredibly sophisticated player behavior.
We ' re beginning to see the emergence of wonderful technologies like real-time energy meters.
We can break things down into highly calibrated small tasks.
Government , well , one thing that comes to mind is the U.S . government , among others , is literally starting to pay people to lose weight.
It ' s about how individual engagement can be transformed by the psychological and the neurological lessons we can learn from watching people that are playing games.
At the EG conference in December 2007 , artist Jonathan Harris discusses his latest projects , which involve collecting stories : his own , strangers '  , and stories collected from the Internet , including his amazing  " We Feel Fine. " 
So I ' m going to talk today about collecting stories in some unconventional ways.
So this is a picture of me holding one of the first watercolor paintings I ever made.
So , first of all , my own stories . These are two of my sketchbooks.
And , you know , after keeping these books for a number of years , I started to become very interested in collecting not only my own personal artifacts , but also the artifacts of other people.
Have fun in whatever you do. " 
So , around this time I was studying computer science at Princeton University , and I noticed that it was suddenly possible to collect these sorts of personal artifacts , not just from street corners , but also from the Internet.
One such project is about a year and a half old.
It collects about 20,000 such sentences a day and it ' s been running for about a year and a half , having collected over 10 and a half million feelings now.
And the diameter of each dot corresponds to the length of the sentence inside.
Also , some of the feelings contain photographs in the blog posts.
 " I feel rough now , and I probably gained 100,000 pounds , but it was worth it. " 
This is showing the world ' s most common feelings overall right now , dominated by better , then bad , then good , then guilty , and so on.
So I ' ll show you now some of my favorite montages from  " We Feel Fine. " 
 " I can feel my cancer grow. " 
 " I can ' t wait to see them racing for the first time at Daytona next month , because I feel the need for speed. " 
Sometimes , stories as short as two or three words.
So these are some newer projects that actually aren ' t even launched publicly yet.
And that water that you see there is the open lead , and through that lead , bowhead whales migrate north each springtime.
I photographed that entire experience at five-minute intervals.
And then in moments of high adrenaline , like when something exciting was happening , I would up that photographic frequency to as many as 37 photographs in five minutes.
What are the things that make up a story ? 
They have time . When did it take place ?  Dates -- when did it occur ? 
But if you think about real life , it ' s not like that at all.
I built a web interface for viewing  " The Whale Hunt "  that attempts to do just this.
So this red strip signifies the color of the wallpaper in the basement apartment where I was staying.
These are organized chronologically.
That ' s  " Moby Dick. " 
This is a really exciting sequence of me sleeping.
And so what I ' ll show you now is the ability to pull out sub-stories.
And you can see Rony cutting up the whale here.
This is the guys on the rope , pulling open the carcass.
So , just yesterday , I flew in here from Singapore , and before that , I was spending two weeks in Bhutan , the small Himalayan kingdom nestled between Tibet and India.
It ' s an incredibly non-materialistic culture , where people don ' t have a lot , but they ' re incredibly happy.
And then when they answered , I would inflate that number of balloons and give them that number of balloons to hold.
And then finally , I would ask them to make a wish.
He was playing cops and robbers with his friends , running around town , and they all had plastic toy guns.
A 17-year-old student . Her wish was to have been born a boy.
He wanted to help poor people.
She was wearing this silver ring that had the word  " love "  engraved on it , and she ' d found it in the road somewhere.
He wanted to live a long life at the monastery.
She wanted to become an independent woman.
But all he wanted was to just live a comfortable life , like other people.
She wanted a change in her life.
He travels from farm to farm each day trying to find work , and then he tries to sleep at whatever farm he gets work at.
A 10-year-old.
One of the more touchy political subjects in Bhutan is the use of Indian cheap labor that they import from India to build the roads , and then they send these people home once the roads are built.
I asked her about her wish , and she said ,  " You know , maybe I ' ll live , maybe I ' ll die , but I don ' t have a wish. " 
I asked her how long she planned to live in the nunnery and she said ,  " Well , you know , of course , it ' s impermanent , but my plan is to live here until I ' m 30 , and then enter a hermitage. " 
I just thought that was amazing . I mean , she spoke in a way -- with amazing English , and amazing humor , and amazing laughter -- that made her seem like somebody I could have bumped into on the streets of New York , or in Vermont , where I ' m from.
And this is what she said.
Woman : Yes , not maybe one , 10 years , maybe I can die within one year , or something like that.
Woman : But I prefer for maybe 40 to 50.
Woman : Thank you.
JH : So if you caught that , she said she hoped to die when she was around 40 . That was enough life for her.
And they ' re actually still flying up there today.
 " To make some money and to open a store "  was the Indian road worker.
architecture,arts,creativity,design,theater
What I mean by that is that it ' s time for architecture to do things again , not just represent things.
I stayed thrilled until I got home , threw the helmet onto my bed , fell down onto my bed and realized inside there was an inscription.
We can only blame ourselves . Over the last 50 years the design and construction industry has gotten much more complex and has gotten much more litigious.
Now , what did we do ?  We ' re cowards , but we ' re smart cowards.
We actually created an artificial schism between creation and execution , as if you could actually create without knowing how to execute and as if you could actually execute without knowing how to create.
Now I ' d argue that that is as absurd as stating that 30 minutes of copulation is the creative act , and nine months of gestation , and , God forbid , 24 hours of child labor is merely execution.
Now , there are all kinds of things that we architects need to learn how to do , like managing contracts , learning how to write contracts , understanding procurement processes , understanding the time value of money and cost estimation.
The second position is : Actually take positions.
And then only after this is done are you allowed to do this , begin to put forward architectural manifestations that manifest those positions.
You do not know what the end result is.
We roll 120-foot Spartan , i.e . our vision , up to our clients '  gates of Troy.
So , we can change the metaphor . Let ' s call the Trojan Horse the vessel by which you get through the gate , get through the constraints of a project.
If we are so good at our craft shouldn ' t we be able to conceive of an architectural manifestation that slides seamlessly through the project ' s and the client ' s constraints ? 
Now , the first issue that we faced was that the Dallas Theater Center had a notoriety that was beyond what you would expect of some place outside of the triumvirate of New York , Chicago and Seattle.
Because they could do whatever they wanted to to this building.
And you can start to get the best artistic directors , scenic designers and actors from around the country to come to perform here because you can do things you can ' t do elsewhere.
That meant that they were able to perform , as long as they had labor they were able to go between proscenium , thrust , flat floor , arena , traverse , you name it.
So , they stopped having inexpensive labor.
It was to take all the things that are known as front of house and back of house and redefine them as above house and below house.
Suddenly the artistic director can move between different stage and audience configurations.
And that provided the artistic director suddenly the ability to define suspension of disbelief.
In fact it really was the clients who had to do it.
And effectively we created what we like to call a theater machine.
One of the things that we learned when we visited various theaters is they hate us architects , because they say the first thing they have to do , the first five minutes of any show , is they have to get our architecture out of the mind of their patron.
But there is also the potential to allow people to move directly from the outside , in this case suggesting kind of Wagnerian entrance , into the interior of the auditorium.
But imagine the freedoms if you could take this further , that in fact you could consider a Wagnerian entry , a first act in thrust , an intermission in Greek , a second act in arena , and you leave through our lobby with dangly bits.
This is the flat floor configuration.
The third configuration is a little harder to understand.
There you see it ' s the side balconies for the proscenium.
Meaning , nothing that we do can we be the first ones to do it.
If you were not able to take the scoreboard out of the arena and be able to do the Ice Capades the next night , that would also be bad.
Here you see the chairs being spun around to go from proscenium or end stage to thrust configuration.
As I said , all that was in service of creating a flexible yet affordable configuration.
But you also have the ability to allow the audience to see Dallas , to perform with Dallas as the backdrop of your performance.
You would be able to expose the auditorium to Dallas or vice versa , Dallas to the auditorium.
You can bring large objects into the chamber itself.
Now , if there is anyone here from American Airlines , please consider doing your Christmas party here.
Here it is in a flat floor configuration.
We stood outside trying to see if the acoustics worked , and you could see the guys doing this but you couldn ' t hear them.
I ' m going to show you a brief time lapse.
And think of it being done with just a few people.
So , just in conclusion , a few shots.
You can see the Winspear Opera House on the right and the Dee and Charles Wyly Theater on the left.
http://www.ted.com/talks/golan_levin_on_software_as_art.html
Golan Levin on software art
And many of you out there are the heads of Macromedia and Microsoft , and in a way those are my bane : I think there ' s a great homogenizing force that software imposes on people and limits the way they think about what ' s possible on the computer.
We ' ve got about a minute left.
And the idea is to visualize their speech and song behind them with a large screen.
He ' s making a , kind of , cheek-flapping sound.
And with that , I think I should give up the stage , so , thank you so much.

And the basic paradigm we want to suggest to you , I want to suggest to you , is one in which you say that in order to treat disease you have to first know what you ' re treating -- that ' s diagnostics -- and then you have to do something.
The rigors of military medicine are not so dissimilar from the third world -- poor resources , a rigorous environment , a series of problems in lightweight , and things of this kind -- and also not so different from the home healthcare and diagnostic system world.
The second is basically an entrepreneur who is set up and doing who-knows-what in a table in a market.
And the way in which one typically approaches a problem of lowering cost , starting from the perspective of the United States , is to take our solution , and then to try to cut cost out of it.
What you see here is a prototypic device.
It ' s made of paper and paper , of course , wicks fluid , as you know , paper , cloth -- drop wine on the tablecloth , and the wine wicks all over everything.
The fluid wicks its way into those chambers at the top.
Now , how simple can you make the production ? 
We have made these kinds of devices using napkins and toilet paper and wraps , and all kinds of stuff.
And then finally , a point that you don ' t think of so much in developed world medicine : it eliminates sharps.
So , how do you dispose of that ?  It ' s a problem everywhere.
And the answer is , of course , yes.
In that particular test , urine either , containing a hormone called HCG , does or does not flow across a piece of paper.
So , it works very well there , but it doesn ' t work very well when you need more quantitative information.
So , the approach that we started with is to ask : Is it really practical to make things of this sort ? 
The wax printer does what looks like printing.
So , it ' s a solved problem , that particular problem is solved.
And so I regard that as done.
And the thing which you ' d most like to analyze , we ' re a fair distance from.
Do they have a common cold ? 
Now even that ' s more complicated than you think.
 " Have you taken it every day ?  "   " Yes. " 
Now , take a look at what a typical test looks like.
So , you take the drop of blood , no further manipulations , you put it on a little device , the device filters out the blood cells , lets the serum go through , and you get a series of colors down in the bottom there.
And so the solution that we and many other people are thinking about there , and at this point there is a dramatic flourish , and out comes the universal solution to everything these days , which is a cell phone . In this particular case , a camera phone.
Turns out to work actually quite well , particularly when your color printer has printed the color bars that indicate how things work.
It turns out there ' s an enormous amount of information already available on that subject , which is the Mars rover problem.
This is a fantastic device which is only beginning to be tapped.
What you see here is another centimeter-sized device , and the different colors are different colors of dye.
You make it flow under and over.
It distributes itself , flows through further holes , distributes itself.
Here is an example of a slightly more complicated device.
So , I think it ' s as low-cost as we ' re likely to be able to come up and make things.
What happens if you don ' t have an electricity , and a centrifuge , and whatever ? 
And we sat down , we did the physics of eggbeaters and self-aligning tubes and all the rest of that kind of thing , sent it off to a journal.
The editor said , with enormous disdain ,  " I read this.
Here is another example of something which is -- this is a little spectrophotometer.
Why doesn ' t somebody do it ?  And the answer is ,  " How do you make a profit in a capitalist system , doing that ?  " 
And we ' ve decided that we should think about this not so much in terms of cost , but in terms of simplicity.
And the most recent involved a couple of people at MIT , one of them being an exceptionally bright kid who is one of the very few people I would think of who ' s an authentic genius.

Rory Stewart : Time to end the war in Afghanistan
Why have we got 130,000 troops on the ground ? 
We came out of the end of the Cold War in despair.
So the question is : What are we doing ? 
The story that we ' re told is that there was a  " light footprint "  initially -- in other words , that we ended up in a situation where we didn ' t have enough troops , we didn ' t have enough resources , that Afghans were frustrated -- they felt there wasn ' t enough progress and economic development and security , and therefore the Taliban came back -- that we responded in 2005 and 2006 with troop deployments , but we still didn ' t put enough troops on the ground.
Every one of those statements is wrong.
And even if they were able to do so , even if I ' m wrong , it ' s extremely unlikely the Taliban would invite back Al-Qaeda.
Because this isn ' t the 1990s anymore.
And these troops that we brought in -- it ' s a great picture of David Beckham there on the sub-machine gun -- made the situation worse , not better.
Within a few months , there were two and a half million more girls in school.
We went from almost no Afghans having mobile telephones during the Taliban to a situation where , almost overnight , three million Afghans had mobile telephones.
Well first see , if you put 125 billion dollars a year into a country like Afghanistan where the entire revenue of the Afghan state is one billion dollars a year , you drown everything.
This is Commandant Haji Malem Mohsin Khan of Kamenj.
This man , for example , Mullah Mustafa , tried to shoot me.
Now this is not to say Afghanistan is a place full of people like Mullah Mustafa.
Today , he could never do that.
No , there have been any number of people saying this over the last seven years.
These are people who were able to say consistently that the increase in development aid was making Afghanistan less secure , not more secure -- that the counter-insurgency strategy was not working and would not work.
Well guess what ?  It didn ' t.
Or in 2008 , Major General Champoux to come in and say he would deliver the  " decisive year. " 
How do we allow any of this to happen ? 
It ' s also very difficult to confront a general with medals on his chest.
What is the solution to this ? 
The first thing we need to change is the structures of our government.
When they go out , they travel in these curious armored vehicles with these somewhat threatening security teams who ready 24 hours in advance who say you can only stay on the ground for an hour.
So we need to change that institutional culture.
And thirdly , we need to have some humility.
Bosnia and Kosovo were signal successes , great successes.
A million properties have been returned.
This has been done by an incredible , principled effort by the international community , and , of course , above all , by Bosnians themselves.
And finally , we need to understand that in Bosnia and Kosovo , a lot of the secret of what we did , a lot of the secret of our success , was our humility -- was the tentative nature of our engagement.
One of the saddest things about our involvement in Afghanistan is that we ' ve got our priorities out of sync.
If what we ' re worried about is poverty and development , sub-Saharan Africa is far more important.
Because when people talk about intervention , they imagine that some scientific theory -- the Rand Corporation goes around counting 43 previous insurgencies producing mathematical formula saying you need one trained counter-insurgent for every 20 members of the population.
It ' s about context.
What we look for in firemen , in climbers , in policemen , and what we should look for in intervention , is intelligent risk takers -- not people who plunge blind off a cliff , not people who jump into a burning room , but who weigh their risks , weigh their responsibilities.
Thank you . Thank you very much.
Bruno Giussani : Rory , you mentioned Libya at the end.
We imagine there are only two choices : either full engagement and troop deployment or total isolation.
We should have limited ourselves very , very strictly to the protection of the civilian population in Benghazi.
In doing so , we ' ve destroyed our credibility with the Security Council , which means it ' s very difficult to get a resolution on Syria , and we ' re setting ourselves up again for failure.
http://www.ted.com/talks/nate_silver_on_race_and_politics.html
Nate Silver : Does race affect votes ? 
He won 375 electoral votes.
One exception is in Massachusetts.
But there is also this part of the country , kind of in the middle region here.
So , when we think about parts of the country like Arkansas , you know.
He lost no worse than most people do.
And we think people like this probably don ' t want to vote for people who look like this and are named Barack Obama.
We know that race was a factor , and the reason why we know that is because we asked those people.
We ' re looking for people that said ,  " Yes , race was a factor ; moreover it was an important factor , in my decision, "  and people who voted for John McCain as a result of that factor , maybe in combination with other factors , and maybe alone.
If those people had voted for Obama , even half of them , Obama would have won Louisiana safely.
You kind of see the relationship between the redder states of where more people responded and said ,  " Yes , Barack Obama ' s race was a problem for me. " 
Is racism predictable in some way ? 
And so we can look at a bunch of different variables.
And you see the relationship there with the racially-based voting patterns.
And the thing about states like Arkansas and Tennessee is that they ' re both very rural , and they are educationally impoverished.
This is conducted by the University of Chicago every other year.
We can see in different types of communities that the results are quite different.
So what we ' re going to do now is take the white people in the survey and split them between those who have black neighbors -- or , really , some neighbor of another race -- and people who have only white neighbors.
And even some questions about race -- for example affirmative action , which is kind of a political question , a policy question about race , if you will -- not much difference here.
There is a big difference.
You see people without neighbors who are African-American who were much more likely to say ,  " That would give me a problem. " 
So if you want to address it , the goal is to facilitate interaction with people of other races.
I think cities facilitate more of the kind of networking , the kind of casual interaction than you might have on a daily basis.
It ' s a traditional Midwestern community , which means you have real grid.
I think that actually this type of urban design , which became more prevalent in the 1970s and 1980s -- I think there is a relationship between that and the country becoming more conservative under Ronald Reagan.
I think part of the education variable we talked about before is the networking experience you get when you go to college where you do get a mix of people that you might not interact with otherwise.
So that ' s all I have to say . Thank you very much.

He began to tap on the chests of his patients , on their abdomens.
One was scratching at the end of the stick , another child listened at the other end.
So within a few years , in the late 1800s , early 1900s , all of a sudden , the barber surgeon had given way to the physician who was trying to make a diagnosis.
In fact , some of you might well know that the barber pole , the red and white stripes , represents the blood bandages of the barber surgeon , and the receptacles on either end represent the pots in which the blood was collected.
Luke Fildes was commissioned to paint this by Tate , who then established the Tate Gallery.
And Fildes was so taken by the physician who held vigil at the bedside for two , three nights , that he decided that he would try and depict the physician in our time -- almost a tribute to this physician.
Would he have substituted a computer screen for where he had the patient ? 
The iPatient is getting wonderful care all across America.
There ' s a real disjunction between the patient ' s perception and our own perceptions as physicians of the best medical care.
Too often these days , rounds look very much like this , where the discussion is taking place in a room far away from the patient.
One had to do with a friend of mine who had a breast cancer , had a small breast cancer detected -- had her lumpectomy in the town in which I lived.
Which is why I was surprised a few months later to see her back in our own town , getting her subsequent care with her private oncologist.
It had a beautiful facility , giant atrium , valet parking , a piano that played itself , a concierge that took you around from here to there.
They understood her breast cancer at the molecular level ; they had no need to touch her breasts.
I was very influenced by that anecdote.
I say that because these are difficult patients.
And if I tried , I ' d disappoint them.
I then scheduled the physical exam for two weeks hence , and when the patient came for the physical , I was able to do a thorough physical , because I had nothing else to do.
I always begin with the pulse , then I examine the hands , then I look at the nail beds , then I slide my hand up to the epitrochlear node , and I was into my ritual.
Now if that were true , it ' s a true condemnation of our health care system , because they had been seen in other places.
The bad news is we don ' t know exactly what ' s causing this , but here ' s what you should do , here ' s what we should do. " 
I took this to my colleagues at Stanford in anthropology and told them the same story.
I ' m not sure why you ' re laughing.
Rituals are terribly important.
I am a writer , and I want to close by reading you a short passage that I wrote that has to do very much with this scene.
I would pull down the eyelids.
I remember so many patients , their names still vivid on my tongue , their faces still so clear.
 " I recall one patient who was at that point no more than a skeleton encased in shrinking skin , unable to speak , his mouth crusted with candida that was resistant to the usual medications.
It was an offering , an invitation.
Neither of us could skip this ritual , which had nothing to do with detecting rales in the lung , or finding the gallop rhythm of heart failure.
And the message , which I didn ' t fully understand then , even as I delivered it , and which I understand better now is this : I will always , always , always be there.

Michael Shermer on strange beliefs
Some people call us debunkers , which is kind of a negative term.
I brought this with me.
This was being sold to high school administrators for 900 dollars a piece.
So it looks something like this.
It ' ll go this way for sure.
But in science , we have to keep track of the misses , not just the hits.
In this case , we tested it.
 " Skeptic "  is the quarterly publication.
Three IQ points per 10 years , going up.
It ' s like , are science and plumbing compatible ? 
It ' s a way of looking for natural explanations for all phenomena.
And before we say something is out of this world , we should first make sure that it ' s not in this world.
For those of you in the back , it says here :  " Then a miracle occurs.
You can say a miracle occurs.
Whereas -- and it ' s true , scientists sometimes throw terms out as linguistic place fillers -- dark energy or dark matter or something like that -- until we figure out what it is , we ' ll just call it this -- it ' s the beginning of the causal chain for science.
This is a UFO shot from my house in Altadena , California , looking down over Pasadena.
You just have somebody off on the side with a hubcap ready to go.
In the case of Galileo , he had two problems when he turned his telescope to Saturn.
And this is what he ended up concluding that he saw.
It wasn ' t till -- Huygens had two things.
And that , in fact , turns out to be true.
Like , we have a tendency to see faces.
And when you ' re squinting , what you ' re doing is you ' re turning that from fine-grain to coarse-grain.
And , of course , happy faces.
Do you see him there ?

Here ' s the Virgin Mary on the side of a glass window in Sao Paulo.
It has that sort of puckered lips , 1940s-era look.
And we went down , investigated.
Here ' s the Virgin Mary on the backside , which they started to wipe off.
There is this film ,  " White Noise, "  with Michael Keaton about the dead talking back to us.
In this case , supposedly , these messages are hidden in electronic phenomena.
Boy , couldn ' t you just listen to that all day ? 
Now , I ' ll prime your auditory part of your brain to tell you what you ' re supposed to hear , and then hear it again.
And in England , there ' s a pop singer.
It ' s a love story -- she ' s sort of the Norah Jones of the U.K . -- about how she much loves her guy , and compared to nine million bicycles , and so forth.
In America it would be ,  " We ' re 6,000 light years from the edge. " 
You know , it ' s 12 -- it ' s 13.7 billion light years , and it ' s not a guess.
And said ,  " I ' m so embarrassed.
♫ We are 13.7 billion light years ♫ ♫ from the edge of the observable universe ♫ ♫ That ' s a good estimate with well-defined error bars ♫ ♫ And with the available information ♫ ♫ I predict that I will always be with you ♫ How cool is that ?

So there ' s a critical window of opportunity we have to make an important difference that can affect the lives of literally millions of people , and practice preventive medicine on a global scale.
And in the MRI and MR spectroscopy here , the prostate tumor activity is shown in red -- you can see it diminishing after a year.

Seth Godin on the tribes we lead
But it got me thinking about the fact that these guys , at least most of them , know what it is that they do for a living.
There is a big schism between the ones who make gospel animals and porn animals , but -- they do a lot of really cool stuff with balloons.
But what do we do for a living ? 
We try to make big , permanent , important change.
And I want to share a couple stories with you today.
Cities gave them a charter to get rid of the stray animals on the street and destroy them.
And everyone said it was impossible.
He connected with people who cared about this : nonprofessionals , people with passion.
And then he went to North Carolina and did it again.
I don ' t know if you ' ve ever been to a Jewish wedding , but what they do is , they take a light bulb and they smash it.
And I want to argue that we are living through and are right at the key moment of a change in the way ideas are created and spread and implemented.
So let me tell you about the three cycles . The first one is the factory cycle.
Well with that sort of advantage you can churn out a lot of cars.
And the problem we ' ve run into is , we ' re running out of both.
I have a better mousetrap.
If necessary you can use babies to sell other stuff.
This model requires you to act like the king , like the person in the front of the room throwing things to the peons in the back.
What we ' ve done as spammers is tried to hypnotize everyone into buying our idea , hypnotize everyone into donating to our cause , hypnotize everyone into voting for our candidate.
What tribes are , is a very simple concept that goes back 50,000 years.
But now , thanks to the internet , thanks to the explosion of mass media , thanks to a lot of other things that are bubbling through our society around the world , tribes are everywhere.
You ' ve got the red-hat triathletes over there.
And people in white hats sailing boats.
Now it turns out this is a legitimate non-photoshopped photo.
You know the pirate tribe is a fascinating one.
Not because you force them to do something against their will , but because they wanted to connect.
And he didn ' t do it by buying a lot of ads.
What Kevin Kelley has taught us is you just need , I don ' t know , a thousand true fans -- a thousand people who care enough that they will get you the next round and the next round and the next round.
So here are two leaders . They don ' t have a lot in common.
And some people will get people to be on the other team.
What would happen if , when you ' re using your Kindle , you could see the comments and quotes and notes from all the other people reading the same book as you in that moment.
But let me just try a couple.
When Diane Hatz worked on  " The Meatrix, "  her video that spread all across the internet about the way farm animals are treated , she didn ' t invent the idea of being a vegan.
Bob Marley did not invent Rastafarians.
That heretics look at the status quo and say ,  " This will not stand . I can ' t abide this status quo.
Someone stands up and says ,  " This one is important.
So Tony Shea does not run a shoe store.
It ' s exactly the same behavior though.
Michelle Kaufman has pioneered new ways of thinking about environmental architecture.
By leading a movement and making change.
Because if you ' re not upsetting anyone , you ' re not changing the status quo.
Because focusing on that part of it -- not the mechanics of what you ' re building , but the who , and the leading part -- is where change comes.
It ' s a story of a product that tells a story.
It ' s tens of thousands of pairs of shoes.
They need the leadership . It makes a difference.
They challenge what ' s currently there.
They connect people to one another.
They want to be missed when they ' re gone.
If you look and study the leaders who have succeeded , that ' s where charisma comes from -- from the leading.
So I ' d like you to do something for me.
Thank you very much . I appreciate it.

Now open your eyes.
This baby is so tiny he doesn ' t have enough fat on his body to stay warm.
The reason is because in the first month of a baby ' s life , its only job is to grow.
But traditional incubators require electricity and cost up to 20 thousand dollars.
On one of my first trips to India , I met this young woman , Sevitha , who had just given birth to a tiny premature baby , Rani.
We needed something that was portable , something that could be sterilized and reused across multiple babies and something ultra-low-cost , compared to the 20,000 dollars that an incubator in the U.S . costs.
You can open it up completely . It ' s waterproof.
It ' s a wax-like substance with a melting point of human body temperature , 37 degrees Celsius.
We plan to launch this product in India in 2010 , and the target price point will be 25 dollars , less than 0.1 percent of the cost of a traditional incubator.
We hope that the Embrace infant warmer and other simple innovations like this represent a new trend for the future of technology : simple , localized , affordable solutions that have the potential to make huge social impact.
And then we thought of the most simple solution we could to address this problem.
At TEDGlobal University , Shereen El Feki shows how some Arab cultures are borrowing trademarks of Western pop culture -- music videos , comics , even Barbie -- and adding a culturally appropriate twist . The hybridized media shows how two civilizations , rather than dividing , can dovetail.
Hello , everyone . Because this is my first time at TED , I ' ve decided to bring along an old friend to help break the ice a bit.
This is Fulla . Fulla is the Arab world ' s answer to Barbie.
well , I ' ve got to tell you , it ' s just not going to be pretty.
The first is 4Shbab.
♫ I am not afraid to stand alone ♫ ♫ I am not afraid to stand alone , if Allah is by my side ♫ ♫ I am not afraid to stand alone ♫ ♫ Everything will be all right ♫ ♫ I am not afraid to stand alone ♫ The Arab world.
4Shbab was set up as an alternative to existing Arab music channels.
But it ' s not about fire and brimstone either.
Now , these are the world ' s first Islamic superheroes.
So , for example , there is the character of Noora.
It ' s now a theme park.
We ' re not talking here about a clash of civilizations.
Throughout its history , Islam has borrowed and adapted from other civilizations both ancient and modern.
In long-term relationships , we often expect our beloved to be both best friend and erotic partner . But as Esther Perel argues , good <em>and</em> committed sex draws on two conflicting needs : our need for security and our need for surprise . So how do you sustain desire ?  With wit and eloquence , Perel lets us in on the mystery of erotic intelligence.
So , why does good sex so often fade , even for couples who continue to love each other as much as ever ? 
And why is the forbidden so erotic ? 
And when you love , how does it feel ? 
A crisis of desire , as in owning the wanting -- desire as an expression of our individuality , of our free choice , of our preferences , of our identity -- desire that has become a central concept as part of modern love and individualistic societies.
And at the heart of sustaining desire in a committed relationship , I think is the reconciliation of two fundamental human needs.
Marriage was an economic institution in which you were given a partnership for life in terms of children and social status and succession and companionship.
Give me novelty , give me familiarity.
Because I think , in some way -- and I ' ll come back to that -- but the crisis of desire is often a crisis of the imagination.
Because therein lies the mystery of eroticism.
We want to minimize the distance . We want to contract that gap.
In desire , we want an Other , somebody on the other side that we can go visit , that we can go spend some time with , that we can go see what goes on in their red light district.
And when it ' s said like that , it ' s often quite abstract.
And across culture , across religion , and across gender -- except for one -- there are a few answers that just keep coming back.
Basically , when I look at my partner radiant and confident , probably the biggest turn-on across the board.
It ' s when I ' m looking at my partner from a comfortable distance , where this person that is already so familiar , so known , is momentarily once again somewhat mysterious , somewhat elusive.
And then , more importantly , in this description about the other or myself -- it ' s the same -- what is most interesting is that there is no neediness in desire.
I have yet to see somebody who is so turned on by somebody who needs them.
But basically it ' s when there is novelty.
Because in some way one could say sex isn ' t something you do , eh ? 
What do you seek to express there ? 
Is it a place where you can express your infantile wishes ? 
You know , animals have sex.
We can hint at it . We don ' t even have to do it.
But the central agent is really that piece called the imagination.
They knew how to keep themselves alive.
 " I turn off my desires when ... "  which is not the same question as ,  " What turns me of is ... "  and  " You turn me off when ... " 
Now , if you are dead inside , the other person can do a lot of things for Valentine ' s.
Because desire comes with a host of feelings that are not always such favorites of love : jealousy , possessiveness , aggression , power , dominance , naughtiness , mischief.
But no , in our mind up there are a host of things going on that we don ' t always know how to bring to the person that we love , because we think love comes with selflessness and in fact desire comes with a certain amount of selfishness in the best sense of the word : the ability to stay connected to one ' s self in the presence of another.
And then at some point they turn around and they look at you , and if you tell them ,  " Hey kiddo , the world ' s a great place . Go for it.
My partner hasn ' t taken care of me in so long.
I will lose my freedom in order not to lose connection.
Child number two comes back but looks like that over their shoulder all the time.
And they may be gone , but they ' re never really away , and those are often the people that will tell you , in the beginning it was super hot.
So what happens , if you want to sustain desire , it ' s that real dialectic piece.
One , they have a lot of sexual privacy.
They also understand that an erotic space isn ' t about , you begin to stroke the other.
Erotic couples also understand that passion waxes and wanes.
Committed sex is premeditated sex.

David Byrne : How architecture helped music evolve
This is a song that was recorded there.
The sound system was kind of decent.
This is Tootsie ' s Orchid Lounge in Nashville.
Since then , I ' ve played other places that are much nicer.
We managed , but sometimes those halls didn ' t seem exactly suited to the music I was making or had made.
Do we all make things with a venue , a context , in mind ? 
The music works perfectly in that setting.
It ' s perfect for that particular context.
It actually improves it.
This is a little bit later.
It fits the room perfectly.
They used to eat , drink and yell out to people on the stage , just like they do at CBGB ' s and places like that.
And the size of the room is not that big.
He wanted a little more bombast , so he increased the size of the orchestra pit so he could get more low-end instruments in there.
The halls got bigger . Carnegie Hall ' s fair-sized.
They had to be very quiet.
But because of the reverberation in those rooms like Carnegie Hall , the music had to be maybe a little less rhythmic and a little more textural.
Popular music , coming along at the same time.
There ' s certain sections of the song -- the songs had different sections that the dancers really liked.
And a new form of music was born.
Same thing goes true for -- that ' s the beginning of the century -- for the whole of 20th-century popular music , whether it ' s rock or Latin music or whatever.
Microphones enabled singers , in particular , and musicians and composers , to completely change the kind of music that they were writing.
And this kind of thing would have been impossible without a microphone.
The effect is just electric.
And they no longer have to be exactly the same.
And , as with jazz , the dancers liked certain sections more than they did others.
Live performance , when it was incredibly successful , ended up in what is probably , acoustically , the worst sounding venues on the planet : sports stadiums , basketball arenas and hockey arenas.
The tempos are medium . It sounds big.
One of the new ones is the automobile.
The music that , I would say , is written for automobile sound systems works perfectly on it.
Presumably , this is just for Christian music.
I think pop music , mainly , it ' s written today , to some extent , is written for these kind of players , for this kind of personal experience where you can hear extreme detail , but the dynamic doesn ' t change that much.
And the birds on the floor tend to have lower pitched calls , so that they don ' t get distorted when they bounce off the forest floor.
The tananger on the East Coast of the United States , where the forests are a little denser , has one kind of call , and the tananger on the other side , on the west has a different kind of call.
It ' s adaptive.
And I ' m saying , well , the passion ' s still there , but the vessel that it ' s going to be injected into and poured into , that is instinctively and intuitively created first.
And they ' ll vote for that.
We adapt.
Speaking at TED in 1998 , Rev . Billy Graham marvels at technology ' s power to improve lives and change the world -- but says the end of evil , suffering and death will come only after the world accepts Christ . A legendary talk from TED ' s archives.
As a clergyman , you can imagine how out of place I feel.
And had such -- it was an eye-opening experience to hear them talk about the world that is yet to come through technology and science.
I was to address a conference at a hotel.
I hope that you won ' t feel that these few moments with me is not a -- is an anticlimax , after all these tremendous talks that you ' ve heard , and addresses , which I intend to listen to every one of them.
And he was slapping the stewardess and pinching her as she went by , and everybody was upset with him.
He said ,  " You don ' t say! " 
I know that as you have been peering into the future , and as we ' ve heard some of it here tonight , I would like to live in that age and see what is going to be.
We ' ve had others.
He was a man of tremendous leadership.
But they wouldn ' t allow the Israelis to look into it , or to have any.
And in the course of one generation , Israel was completely changed.
And they ' re still with us , and you haven ' t solved them , and I haven ' t heard anybody here speak to that.
How do we solve it ? 
On one hand , we can probe the deepest secrets of the universe and dramatically push back the frontiers of technology , as this conference vividly demonstrates.
Now , what causes this ? 
We find ourselves in the paralyzing grip of self-destructive habits we can ' t break.
How do we change man , so that he doesn ' t lie and cheat , and our newspapers are not filled with stories of fraud in business or labor or athletics or wherever ? 
The British philosopher Bertrand Russell was not a religious man , but he said ,  " It ' s in our hearts that the evil lies , and it ' s from our hearts that it must be plucked out. " 
He said ,  " It ' s easier to denature plutonium than to denature the evil spirit of man. " 
The Oklahoma City bombing was simple technology , horribly used.
He couldn ' t free himself from personal problems and personal evils that included murder and adultery.
And there ' s something inside of us that is beyond our understanding.
I find [that] young people all over the world are searching for something.
And it ' ll be on these questions : where did I come from ?  Why am I here ?  Where am I going ? 
I remember once , I sat beside Mrs . Gorbachev at a White House dinner.
What shall I talk to her about ?  " 
I was a little bit surprised , but that evening that ' s what we talked about , and it was a stimulating conversation.
Yes , to be sure , science has done much to push back certain types of human suffering.
I haven ' t given a talk in nearly four months.
I ' m not reading . I never read an address.
But even here among us , most -- in the most advanced society in the world , we have poverty.
Why do we suffer ?  It ' s an age-old question that we haven ' t answered.
Many commentators have said that death is the forbidden subject of our generation.
Marilyn Monroe is just as beautiful on the screen as she was in person , and our -- many young people think she ' s still alive.
And they ' re -- they ' re just as great on that screen as they were in person.
About 300 of them were there.
And it ' s often difficult for young people to understand that.
I ' ve stood at the deathbed of several famous people , whom you would know.
I talked to a woman this past week whose father was a famous doctor.
Was there a God ? 
But it does not need to have to be that way.
I knew Dr . von Braun very well.
I ' ve done a lot of speaking in Germany and in France , and in different parts of the world -- 105 countries it ' s been my privilege to speak in.
He said ,  " So do I. " 
Blaise Pascal asked exactly that question in seventeenth-century France.
And of course , you are all familiar with the computer language named for him.
On November 23 , 1654 , Pascal had a profound religious experience.
He experienced it in a way that went beyond scientific observation and reason.
But if instead you bet that there is no God , then you can lose it all , in this life and the life to come. " 
King David lived to be 70 , a long time in his era.

Brute computing force alone can’t solve the world’s problems . Data mining innovator Shyam Sankar explains why solving big problems is not a question of finding the right algorithm , but rather the right symbiotic relationship between computation and human creativity.
I ' d like to tell you about two games of chess.
The second game was a freestyle chess tournament in 2005 , in which man and machine could enter together as partners , rather than adversaries , if they so chose.
Not a grandmaster with a supercomputer , but actually two American amateurs using three relatively weak laptops.
Instead , it ' s about cooperation , and the right type of cooperation.
But as we enter the era of big data , of network systems , of open platforms , and embedded technology , I ' d like to suggest it ' s time to reevaluate an alternative vision that was actually developed around the same time.
Note that word  " cooperate. " 
Of course , in other ways , humans are so limited.
Silently , without much fanfare , this approach has been compiling victories beyond chess.
Foldit , a game created by computer scientists , illustrates the value of the approach.
A protease that had eluded determination for over 10 years was solved was by three players in a matter of days , perhaps the first major scientific advance to come from playing a video game.
When you put it all together , it ' s quite a computational challenge : 3,500 victims , 1,800 adjacency requests , the importance of the overall physical specifications and the final aesthetics.
So the more you look around you , the more you see Licklider ' s vision everywhere.
Instead of thinking about what a computer will do to solve the problem , design the solution around what the human will do as well.
What Kasparov calls process is a byproduct of friction.
Every interaction we have in the world is recorded by an ever growing array of sensors : your phone , your credit card , your computer . The result is big data , and it actually presents us with an opportunity to more deeply understand the human condition.
Again , we start by designing the human into the process.
And so while computers alone can catch all but the cleverest fraudsters , catching the cleverest is the difference between success and failure.
Computers don ' t detect novel patterns and new behaviors , but humans do . Humans , using technology , testing hypotheses , searching for insight by asking machines to do things for them.
There is no  " Find Terrorist "  button , and the more data we integrate from a vast variety of sources across a wide variety of data formats from very disparate systems , the less effective data mining can be.
That must be acknowledged , and they can ' t be swept aside , even with the best of intents.
These foreign fighters had left their families in the Gulf , the Levant and North Africa to join al Qaeda in Iraq.
They answered questions like ,  " Who recruited you ?  " 
Analyzing this data was hard . The originals were sheets of paper in Arabic that had to be scanned and translated.
In March of 2007 , he gave a speech , after which there was a surge in participation amongst Libyan foreign fighters.

Nigel Marsh : How to make work-life balance work
It was the advice that I decided to follow myself when I turned 40.
So I stepped back from the workforce , and I spent a year at home with my wife and four young children.
And I have four observations I ' d like to share with you today.
Now the first step in solving any problem is acknowledging the reality of the situation you ' re in.
We should stop looking outside.
Now I ' m not talking here just about the bad companies -- the  " abattoirs of the human soul, "  as I call them.
On the one hand , putting childcare facilities in the workplace is wonderful and enlightened.
Before I went back to work after my year at home , I sat down and I wrote out a detailed , step-by-step description of the ideal balanced day that I aspired to.
Have breakfast with my wife and children.
Play a sport with a friend at lunchtime.
Meditate for half an hour.
We need to be realistic.
There ' s got to be a middle way.
It ' s totally dominated by work.
So I ' ve decided to get a grip and sort it out.
And to be balanced , I believe we have to attend to all of those areas -- not just do 50 stomach crunches.
And I understand.
Because she had to be somewhere else with the other three children for that evening.

Moreover , I think , it can transform society.
In an emotionally charged talk , MacArthur-winning activist Majora Carter details her fight for environmental justice in the South Bronx -- and shows how minority neighborhoods suffer most from flawed urban policy.
If you ' re here today -- and I ' m very happy that you are -- you ' ve all heard about how sustainable development will save us from ourselves . However , when we ' re not at TED , we are often told that a real sustainability policy agenda is just not feasible , especially in large , urban areas like New York City.
When she came into my life , we were fighting against a huge waste facility planned for the East River waterfront , despite the fact that our small part of New York City already handled more than 40 percent of the entire city ' s commercial waste : a sewage treatment pelletizing plant , a sewage sludge plant , four power plants , the world ' s largest food distribution center , as well as other industries that bring more than 60,000 diesel truck trips to the area each week.
Then , while jogging with my dog one morning , she pulled me into what I thought was just another illegal dump.
And just like my new dog , it was an idea that got bigger than I ' d imagined.
And , in the fall , I ' m actually going to -- I exchange marriage vows with my beloved . Thank you very much.
Unfortunately , race and class are extremely reliable indicators as to where one might find the good stuff , like parks and trees , and where one might find the bad stuff , like power plants and waste facilities.
Why would someone leave their home to go for a brisk walk in a toxic neighborhood ? 
These impacts are coming everyone ' s way.
This comes at a high cost to taxpayers and produces no proportional benefits.
Well , first of all , we ' re all incredibly good-looking -- -- graduated high school , college , post-graduate degrees , traveled to interesting places , didn ' t have kids in your early teens , financially stable , never been imprisoned . OK.
My big brother Lenny fought in Vietnam , only to be gunned down a few blocks from our home.
But the things we have in common set me apart from most of the people in my community , and I am in between these two worlds , with enough of my heart to fight for justice in the other.
My dad was not alone.
Hunts Point was formerly a walk-to-work community , but now residents had neither work nor home to walk to.
The South Bronx , which lies in between , did not stand a chance.
And if you are told from your earliest days that nothing good is going to come from your community , that is bad and ugly , how could it not reflect on you ? 
Because from a planning perspective , economic degradation begets environmental degradation , which begets social degradation.
What costs are associated with these decisions ?  And who pays ? 
That small park I told you about earlier was the first stage of building a greenway movement in the South Bronx.
Think bike shops , juice stands.
Right now we ' re separated by about 25 feet of water , but this link will change that.
The Sheridan Expressway is an underutilized relic of the Robert Moses era , built with no regard for the neighborhoods that were divided by it.
We also built the city ' s -- New York City ' s first green and cool roof demonstration project on top of our offices.
And they provide habitats for our little friends!
Anyway , I know Chris told us not to do pitches up here , but since I have all of your attention : we need investors . End of pitch.
In the post-Katrina era , we have still more in common.
We are more than simply national symbols of urban blight.
Now listen , I do not expect individuals , corporations or government to make the world a better place because it is right or moral.
I ' m interested in what I like to call the  " triple bottom line "  that sustainable development can produce.
A parade of government subsidies is going to proposed big-box and stadium developments in the South Bronx , but there is scant coordination between city agencies on how to deal with the cumulative effects of increased traffic , pollution , solid waste and the impacts on open space . And their approaches to local economic and job development are so lame it ' s not even funny.
Now , what ' s missing from the larger debate is a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis between not fixing an unhealthy , environmentally challenged community , versus incorporating structural , sustainable changes.
You probably all have it , and if you haven ' t , you need to.
I do have a problem with developments that hyper-exploit politically vulnerable communities for profit.
Let ' s take Bogota . Poor , Latino , surrounded by runaway gun violence and drug trafficking : a reputation not unlike that of the South Bronx.
If you ' re a mayor , you can do something about that.
People stopped littering ; crime rates dropped -- because the streets were alive with people.
But Bogota ' s example has the power to change that.
Don ' t just talk about it at TED . This is a nationwide policy agenda I ' m trying to build , and as you all know , politics are personal.
Support investments with a triple-bottom-line return.
His response was a grant program.
Now , don ' t get me wrong , we need money.
Please don ' t waste me . By working together , we can become one of those small , rapidly growing groups of individuals who actually have the audacity and courage to believe that we actually can change the world.
Researcher Hans Rosling uses his cool data tools to show how countries are pulling themselves out of poverty . He demos Dollar Street , comparing households of varying income levels worldwide . Then he does something really amazing.
I told you three things last year.
Things are changing and today , on the United Nations Statistic Division Home Page , it says , by first of May , full access to the databases.
And let me repeat what you saw last year.
At that time there was a  " we "  and  " them. " 
You can see how China is the red , big bubble.
Large families still , and the HIV epidemic brought down the countries like this.
Because this is where we are.
And this is where we are today.
Here you have child mortality -- that is , survival -- four kids dying there , 200 dying there.
Some countries still had statistics.
So this is what happens in the world , if we play the entire world.
And here , children don ' t live longer.
And this is the United States moving away here , earning more money.
It moves this way over here.
And I take the United States -- we still want to see the background -- I put them up like this , and now we go backwards.
And that means United States was richer , but lost more kids than India is doing today , proportionally.
About 1957 here , the health of the United States is the same as the Philippines.
And 1957 -- the United States had the same economy as Chile has today.
Within some years Chile may have better child survival than the United States.
Now we can take away this -- and I would like to show you the rate of speed , the rate of change , how fast they have gone.
And here we go . Here we go.
And they are taking over Sweden , and they are now healthier than Sweden.
And this changes gradually.
And this is my family.
And Sweden was like Mozambique.
I think it ' s the best way of verifying historical statistics.
I ' m the Mexican in the family.
They ' re so close to the hospital we can never beat them out in these forests.
But it ' s not really that easy , that it ' s all a good story.
This is 1962 , and United States was emitting 16 tons per person.
There is no one who has done it so far.
The Minister of the Environment of India said ,  " Well , you were the one who caused the problem. " 
From now on we count per capita.
I ' ve been criticized for showing you a too positive image of the world , but I don ' t think it ' s like this.
What they earn here -- what number they live on -- is how much they earn per day.
And how do they live ? 
And here it ' s a much nicer bedroom , you can see.
Although there is a sofa , if you watch in the kitchen , you can see that the great difference for women does not come between one to 10 dollars.
These are all pictures and images from Africa , and it can become much better.
And this is the result of the farmers-needs research.
It ' s about having food.
That ' s one context.
Get us a mill so that we can mill our flour , then we will be able to pay for the rest ourselves. " 
She wants her kid to be healthy , so she can go to the market and doesn ' t have to stay home.
And information will tell her when to go to market with which product.
In 50 years they ' ve gone from a pre-Medieval situation to a very decent 100-year-ago Europe , with a functioning nation and state.
We have to know a little more about the world.
I only know two types of wine -- red and white.
But I have to get serious . And how do you get serious ? 
I ' m telling you that there are many dimensions of development.
Or if you are a teacher , you ' ll love UNESCO , and so on.
Now , what we need to think about is , what is a goal for development , and what are the means for development ? 
It was the government that made law function finally.
Human rights is also important , but it just gets one cross.
It ' s the best mean , but I give it zero as a goal.
And that ' s good , it gets two plusses.
Of course , it ' s human rights.
So the seemingly impossible is possible.
We can have a good world.
It ' s a cultural expression that for thousands of years has inspired human beings to think beyond the obvious.
Can I request a moment of absolute silence ?

And you might also know that , for science and medicine , Boston is a bit of a candy store.
And it ' s fair to say that in these 10 years , we ' ve witnessed absolutely the start of a scientific revolution -- that of genome medicine.
You might know that , so far in just the dawn of this revolution , we know that there are perhaps 40,000 unique mutations affecting more than 10,000 genes , and that there are 500 of these genes that are bona-fide drivers , causes of cancer.
We didn ' t sequence his genome.
There ' s no Ras , no Myc , no P53 drug.
It ' s a horrible term of trade.
And so , I guess you ' d say , dissatisfied with the performance and quality of these medicines , I went back to school in chemistry with the idea that perhaps by learning the trade of discovery chemistry and approaching it in the context of this brave new world of the open-source , the crowd-source , the collaborative network that we have access to within academia , that we might more quickly bring powerful and targeted therapies to our patients.
When it winds up its genome , divides into two cells and unwinds again , why does it not turn into an eye , into a liver , as it has all the genes necessary to do this ? 
So we developed an idea , a rationale , that perhaps , if we made a molecule that prevented the Post-it note from sticking by entering into the little pocket at the base of this spinning protein , then maybe we could convince cancer cells , certainly those addicted to this BRD4 protein , that they ' re not cancer.
We just started mailing it to our friends.
It ' s what we call a perfect fit of shape complimentarity , or hand in glove.
The cancer cells , small , round and rapidly dividing , grew these arms and extensions.
The next step would be to put this molecule into mice.
And every nursing shift we would throw this material out.
And he obliged us.
And as we treat it with our compound , this addiction to sugar , this rapid growth , faded.
The mice with this cancer that get the drug live , and the ones that don ' t rapidly perish.
We published a paper that described this finding at the earliest prototype stage.
We basically tried to create the most competitive environment for our lab as possible.
Leukemia cells treated with this compound turn into normal white blood cells.
And in fact , this molecule prevents this adipocyte , this fat stem cell , from remembering how to make fat such that mice on a high fat diet , like the folks in my hometown of Chicago , fail to develop fatty liver , which is a major medical problem.
We have this molecule , but it ' s not a pill yet.
It ' s here where I have to say that we could use your help and your insights , your collaborative participation.
This molecule will soon leave our benches and go into a small startup company called Tensha Therapeutics.
The first is if anything is unique about this research , it ' s less the science than the strategy -- that this for us was a social experiment , an experiment in what would happen if we were as open and honest at the earliest phase of discovery chemistry research as we could be.
And so we seek really to download from the amazing successes of the computer science industry two principles : that of opensource and that of crowdsourcing to quickly , responsibly accelerate the delivery of targeted therapeutics to patients with cancer.
And one thing I ' ve learned in Boston is that you people will do anything for cancer -- and I love that.

Sean Carroll : Distant time and the hint of a multiverse
And if you take a camera and you point it at a random part of the sky , and you just keep the shutter open , as long as your camera is attached to the Hubble Space Telescope , it will see something like this.
The age of the universe , between now and the Big Bang , is a hundred billion in dog years.
I ' ve often wondered , what is the evolutionary pressure that made our ancestors in the Veldt adapt and evolve to really enjoy pictures of galaxies when they didn ' t have any.
If you looked at one of these galaxies and measured its velocity , it would be moving away from you.
In the past , the universe was more dense , and it was also hotter.
You might think that that ' s not a surprise.
In particular , things were a lot denser.
And you have to imagine doing that squeezing without any imperfections , without any little spots where there were a few more atoms than somewhere else.
There is something that made it that way.
You ' ve heard of entropy.
If you have the air in this room , you don ' t notice each individual atom.
The reason why entropy increases is simply because there are many more ways to be high entropy than to be low entropy.
The fact that you are born , and then you live , and then you die , always in that order , that ' s because entropy is increasing.
We ' d like to understand that.
One of the people who did understand that this was a problem was Richard Feynman.
He gave lectures to Caltech graduate students that became  " The Feynman Lectures on Gravitation. " 
So that ' s our job.
We learned that it ' s accelerating.
Individual galaxies are speeding away from us faster and faster so we say the universe is accelerating.
And this energy , according to Einstein , exerts a push on the universe.
This has crucial implications for what the universe is going to do in the future.
Einstein was fond of this idea.
Space may be finite or infinite , but because the universe is accelerating , there are parts of it we cannot see and never will see.
In the 1970s , Stephen Hawking told us that a black hole , even though you think it ' s black , it actually emits radiation when you take into account quantum mechanics.
And so even though the universe will last forever , and ordinary matter and radiation will dilute away , there will always be some radiation , some thermal fluctuations , even in empty space.
He said , well , entropy increases because there are many , many more ways for the universe to be high entropy , rather than low entropy.
It ' s very , very unlikely.
He didn ' t know about the Big Bang . He didn ' t know about the expansion of the universe.
And then , of course , in the natural course of things , they will expand back.
Remember , life itself depends on the arrow of time.
Occasionally , you will make a planet or a star or a galaxy or a hundred billion galaxies.
Now your homework assignment is to really think about this , to contemplate what it means.
That will happen much more frequently than the random motions of atoms making you an apple orchard and some sugar and an oven , and then making you an apple pie.
The good news is that , therefore , this scenario does not work ; it is not right.
Feynman says ,  " From the hypothesis that the world is a fluctuation , all the predictions are that if we look at a part of the world we ' ve never seen before , we will find it mixed up , and not like the piece we ' ve just looked at -- high entropy.
If the universe is not a fluctuation , why did the early universe have a low entropy ? 
The universe is expanding for the last 10 billion years or so.
They will fall into black holes.
But even black holes don ' t last forever.
So even though the universe lasts forever , there ' s only a finite number of things that can possibly happen in the universe.
Why aren ' t we in empty space ? 
More homework assignment for you.
This is a brute fact about the universe that you should learn to accept and stop asking questions.
Maybe the universe comes out of a universal chicken.
So the organizers asked me to end with a bold speculation.
And even better , we will understand what happened at the Big Bang in terms of a theory that we will be able to compare to observations.

Before that time , I had never been away from my home in Malawi.
My English lost , I wanted to vomit.
I would like to share that story today.
Before I discovered the wonders of science , I was just a simple farmer in a country of poor farmers.
Within five months all Malawians began to starve to death.
We drop down to nothing.
It was the future I couldn ' t accept.
I couldn ' t read English that well.
Pump water meant irrigation , a defense against hunger , which we were experiencing by that time.
I found a tractor fan , shock absorber , PVC pipes.
Another machine pumps water for irrigation.
I had never seen an airplane before.
God bless.

Pranav Mistry : The thrilling potential of SixthSense technology
When you talk about objects , one other thing automatically comes attached to that thing , and that is gestures : how we manipulate these objects , how we use these objects in everyday life.
So , I am very interested , from the beginning , that how -- how our knowledge about everyday objects and gestures , and how we use these objects , can be leveraged to our interactions with the digital world.
Most of you might be aware that , in those days , the mouse used to come with a ball inside , and there were two rollers that actually guide the computer where the ball is moving , and , accordingly , where the mouse is moving.
What I got is basically a gesture interface device that actually acts as a motion-sensing device made for two dollars.
A message written on a sticky note to my mom on paper can come to an SMS , or maybe a meeting reminder automatically syncs with my digital calendar -- a to-do list that automatically syncs with you.
So , I implemented this pen that can help designers and architects not only think in three dimensions , but they can actually draw so that it ' s more intuitive to use that way.
A coffee cup will show where you can find more coffee , or where you can trash the cup.
But then I realized that we humans are not actually interested in computing.
So I thought , around last year -- in the beginning of the last year -- I started thinking ,  " Why can I not take this approach in the reverse way ?  " 
So , in order to realize this dream , I actually thought of putting a big-size projector on my head.
But later , I realized that I actually wanted to interact with those digital pixels , also.
You can start using any surface , any wall around you , as an interface.
You can start painting on any wall.
The camera is actually doing -- just , getting all the images -- is doing the edge recognition and also the color recognition and so many other small algorithms are going on inside.
And later I can find a wall , anywhere , and start browsing those photos or maybe ,  " OK , I want to modify this photo a little bit and send it as an email to a friend. " 
The camera is actually not only understanding your hand movements , but , interestingly , is also able to understand what objects you are holding in your hand.
So , I was seeing the live [video] of his talk , outside , on just a newspaper.
It will change the way we interact with people , also , not only the physical world.
We actually do lots of accounting and paper editing and all those kinds of things ; what about that ? 
I removed the microphone from that , and then just pinched that -- like I just made a clip out of the microphone -- and clipped that to a piece of paper , any paper that you found around.
and I am a Wilderness Explorer in Tribe 54. "  )  And you can of course play games.
So , more interestingly , I ' m interested in how we can take that in a more dynamic way.
Here , I ' m taking a part of a document and putting over here a second part from a second place -- and I ' m actually modifying the information that I have over there.
And it will actually help us not end up being machines sitting in front of other machines.
What are you doing with this ?  Is there a company being planned ? 
We should have a  ' Fifth Sense '  for missing-sense people who cannot speak.
We will provide all the open source software for them , maybe starting next month.

And now , if you see , it ' s more about the cost-effectiveness : this system costs you $300 compared to the $20,000 surface tables , or anything like that.

http://www.ted.com/talks/denis_dutton_a_darwinian_theory_of_beauty.html
Denis Dutton : A Darwinian theory of beauty
Now this is an extremely complicated subject , in part because the things that we call beautiful are so different.
I can , however , give you at least a taste of what I regard as the most powerful theory of beauty we yet have.
It ' s in the eye of the beholder.
Taste for both natural beauty and for the arts travel across cultures with great ease.
Or just think about American jazz or American movies -- they go everywhere.
We need to reverse-engineer our present artistic tastes and preferences and explain how they came to be engraved in our minds by the actions of both our prehistoric , largely pleistocene environments , where we became fully human , but also by the social situations in which we evolved.
Now , I personally have no doubt whatsoever that the experience of beauty , with its emotional intensity and pleasure , belongs to our evolved human psychology.
The first of these is natural selection -- that ' s random mutation and selective retention -- along with our basic anatomy and physiology -- the evolution of the pancreas or the eye or the fingernails.
The peacock ' s magnificent tail is the most famous example of this.
It ' s quite a familiar story.
Now , keeping these ideas firmly in mind , we can say that the experience of beauty is one of the ways that evolution has of arousing and sustaining interest or fascination , even obsession , in order to encourage us toward making the most adaptive decisions for survival and reproduction.
So evolution ' s trick is to make them beautiful , to have them exert a kind of magnetism to give you the pleasure of simply looking at them.
It ' s a kind of Hudson River school landscape featuring open spaces of low grasses interspersed with copses of trees.
The ideal savanna landscape is one of the clearest examples where human beings everywhere find beauty in similar visual experience.
No , I don ' t think it is.
But artistic and decorative skills are actually much older than that.
The oldest stone tools are choppers from the Olduvai Gorge in East Africa.
Now , the sheer numbers of these hand axes shows that they can ' t have been made for butchering animals.
So what were these ancient -- I mean , they ' re ancient , they ' re foreign , but they ' re at the same time somehow familiar.
Competently made hand axes indicated desirable personal qualities -- intelligence , fine motor control , planning ability , conscientiousness and sometimes access to rare materials.
It ' s hard to grasp , but it ' s an incredible fact.
Yes , hairstyling -- I insist on that.
We find beauty in something done well.
No , it ' s deep in our minds.
In this bracingly honest talk , international security strategist Thomas Barnett outlines a post-Cold War solution for the foundering U.S . military that is both sensible and breathtaking in its simplicity : Break it in two.
I get asked a lot what the difference between my work is and typical Pentagon long-range strategic planners.
The material I ' m going to show you is one idea from a book with a lot of ideas.
Here ' s my favorite bonehead concept from the 1990s in the Pentagon : the theory of anti-access , area-denial asymmetrical strategies.
They ' re going to be small.
That ' s how distant we are from even meeting an air force willing to fly against ours.
OK ? 
Here ' s my parody and it ain ' t much of one.
I don ' t know , the Million Man Swim.
Trojan horses on our computer networks reveal all our Achilles '  heels instantly.
That ' s the problem.
They said we couldn ' t do Afghanistan . We did it with ease.
There is nobody we can ' t take down.
Problem is , the Defense Department over here beats the hell out of you.
It ' s about non-lethal technologies , because if you fire real ammo into a crowd of women and children rioting you ' re going to lose friends very quickly.
We asked the Indians for 17,000 peace keepers.
We don ' t think you can pull it off , we ' re not going to give you our 17,000 peace keepers for fodder. " 
It ' s your oil , not ours. " 
But it ' s not a perfect world , and your administration isn ' t getting us any closer. " 
And it ' s time to start admitting you can ' t ask the same 19-year-old to do it all , day in and day out.
Frankly , we do it better than anybody and we still suck at it.
The problem is he doesn ' t exist.
What we need to build is a force for the Everything Else.
It ' s the IMF Sovereign Bankruptcy Plan , OK ? 
It ' s transparent . A certain amount of certainty gives the sense of a non-zero outcome.
What would an A to Z system look like ? 
What can they do ? 
That gets you about four million dead in Central Africa over the 1990s.
What we do have is the U.S.-enabled Leviathan Force that says ,  " You want me to take that guy down ?  I ' ll take that guy down.
That ' s called the Powell Doctrine.
A functioning executive that will translate will into action , because we don ' t have it.
And if that doesn ' t work we scream ,  " He ' s got a gun! " 
France says ,  " No , but I do like to criticize you after the fact. " 
No looting , no military disappearing , no arms disappearing , no ammo disappearing , no Muqtada al-Sadr -- I ' m wrecking his bones -- no insurgency.
Why ?  Because they just got fed up.
What we need is an international reconstruction fund -- Sebastian Mallaby , Washington Post , great idea.
Check out their agenda since 9/11.
Here ' s my challenge to the Defense Department.
You tell me it ' s too hard to do.
Would you like Mugabe gone ? 
They ' ve been experiencing an identity crisis since the end of the Cold War.
The split starts to emerge between those in the military who see a future they can live with , and those who see a future that starts to scare them , like the U.S . submarine community , which watches the Soviet Navy disappear overnight.
And if you can ' t find one you ' ve got to make one up.
Actually , most of them.
They spent the 1990s working the messy scene between globalized parts of the world What I call the core and the gap.
And what did we do home alone ? 
I used to give this brief inside the Pentagon in the early 1990s.
Can you come back next year and remind us again ?  " 
Some people put these two things together and they call it empire , which I think is a boneheaded concept.
I prefer that phrase System Administration.
This is a concept which gets me vilified throughout the Pentagon.
Security has meant everything else.
A big stick , a baton stick.
To attack America is to risk blowing up the world.
That ' s the scary part.
Let ' s have a Department of War , and a Department of Something Else.
It ' s going to be the Department of Agriculture for the 21st century.
I supported the war in Iraq.
I knew we ' d have a hard time with what followed.
I love this force . I don ' t want to see it go.
What does this mean ? 
It ' s too much.
You need the experience.
You break out that Leviathan Force only every so often.
Other differences . Leviathan traditional partners , they all look like the Brits and their former colonies.
You ' re not going to get away from that.
And I ' m amazed nobody asked her that question when she was confirmed.
It ' s everything the man ' s military hates.
The force on the left respects Posse Comitatus restrictions on the use of force inside the U.S.
Sys Admin Force has to.
Do we need a bigger budget ? 
I say ,  " Great , I ' m going to take the Sys Admin budget out of your hide. " 
Inter agency-ize it , internationalize it.
We ' re going to have a Department of Something Else between war and peace.
And this is when they think about beating the crap out of me after the talk.
They get up every morning , they want to dig a hole and they want to kill something.
It keeps it from being the U.N.
I tell young officers ,  " You may command 500 ships in your career.
Armor goes this way.
Air force , strategic airlift goes both ways.
Civil Affairs , that bastard child , comes over here.
They drop in , do their business , disappear.
I want to keep trigger-pullers trigger-happy.
Reserve component -- National Guard reserves overwhelmingly Sys Admin.
This is about being up front with these guys and gals.
It ' s not secret.
Take a gift in the left hand.
http://www.ted.com/talks/dennis_hong_making_a_car_for_blind_drivers.html
Dennis Hong : Making a car for blind drivers
So before I talk about this car for the blind , let me briefly tell you about another project that I worked on called the DARPA Urban Challenge.
So about that time , the National Federation of the Blind , or NFB , challenged the research committee about who can develop a car that lets a blind person drive safely and independently.
We couldn ' t have been more wrong.
And in the summer of 2009 , we invited dozens of blind youth from all over the country and gave them a chance to take it for a spin.
So how does it work ? 
Now obviously the driver cannot see , so the system needs to perceive the environment and gather information for the driver.
We also use two cameras to detect the lanes of the road.
One is , first of all , process this information to have an understanding of the environment -- these are the lanes of the road , there ' s the obstacles -- and convey this information to the driver.
So for this , we developed many different types of non-visual user interface technology.
So these are a pair of gloves , and it has vibrating elements on the knuckle part so you can convey instructions about how to steer -- the direction and the intensity.
So over here , you can see how the computer understands the environment , and because you cannot see the vibration , we actually put red LED ' s on the driver so that you can see what ' s happening.
So this is not really freedom , right ? 
A good example for this informational non-visual user interface is called AirPix.
Actually , you can also change the frequency of the air coming out and possibly the temperature.
This simulator was also very useful for training the blind drivers and also quickly testing different types of ideas for different types of non-visual user interfaces.
Announcer : This is an historic day in January.
Well there comes the first box.
And he ' s perfectly making his way between the two.
Dennis Hong : I ' m so happy for you.
Letters thanking us , but sometimes you also get funny letters like this one :  " Now I understand why there is Braille on a drive-up ATM machine. " 
And I truly believe that this can happen.
There ' s many of these different kinds of hurdles besides technology challenges that we need to address before this becomes a reality.
And together with this new type of interfaces , we can use these technologies and apply them to safer cars for sighted people.
So today , the things I ' ve showed you today , is just the beginning.
266
And my mom took these pictures actually , last week , of our carpets , and I remember this to this day.
I was a teenager , and at 15 or 16 , I guess like all teenagers , we want to just do what we love and what we believe in.
It was really a death trap . I mean , it was incredible , it worked incredibly well , but it was really dangerous.
And I saw something extraordinary happening in Silicon Valley , so I wanted to be there , and I saw that the computer was coming into our homes , that it had to change in order to be with us in our homes.
I mean , in retrospect , probably stupid questions , but things like ,  " What ' s this Caps Lock key for ?  " 
They were really looking for us , the designers , to create the skins , to put some pretty stuff outside of the box.
And then I saw this quote :  " advertising is the price companies pay for being unoriginal. " 
And so the first projects were sort of humble , but they took technology and maybe made it into things that people would use in a new way , and maybe finding some new functionality.
This is a little piece of furniture for an Italian manufacturer , and it ships completely flat , and then it folds into a coffee table and a stool and whatnot.
And then finally , the leaf lamp for Herman Miller.
And that ' s a unique opportunity , I would say , in design.
And it ' s done in a very simple way : one just touches the base of the light , and on one side , you can mix the brightness , and on the other , the coloration of the light.
You know , they can be about function and beauty ; they can be about business strategy.
And by knowing when it is you ' re talking , it gets rid of the other noises that it knows about , which is the environmental noises.
But how we work on Jawbone is really unique.
So , it ' s not about slapping skins , anymore , on a technology.
You know , there is some push and pull , but design is really helping define the whole experience from the inside out.
But how do you retain somebody , when it ' s never done ? 
This is called Y Water , and it ' s this guy from Los Angeles , Thomas Arndt , Austrian originally , who came to us , and all he wanted to do was to create a healthy drink , or an organic drink for his kids , to replace the high-sugar-content sodas that he ' s trying to get them away from.
And then while we were doing this , the shape of the bottle upside down reminded us of a Y , and then we thought , well these words ,  " why "  and  " why not, "  are probably the most important words that kids ask.
Here ' s another project , which I think really emulates that.
This girl is going to school with a laptop on her head.
But the third pillar that he talked about was design.
And plus , he said he was going to get rid of the Caps Lock key -- -- and the Num Lock key , too.
They fought the suppliers , they fought the manufacturers.
So , now you get these pictures -- you get up in the morning , and you see the kids in Nigeria and you see them in Uruguay with their computers , and in Mongolia.
It ' s because we were able to run , during the manufacturing process , 20 colors for the X and the O , which is the name of the computer , and by mixing them on the manufacturing floor , you get 20 times 20 : you get 400 different options there.
Like paper , paper and cardboard.
So , the Department of Health in New York came to us , and they needed a way to distribute 36 million condoms for free to the citizens of New York.
And we also designed the condoms themselves.
And here ' s the public service announcement for this project.
It was breaking the ice , it was getting over a stigma , and I think that ' s also what design can do.
And if anybody asks why you ' re carrying a condom , you can just say you like the design.

Freeman Dyson says : let ' s look for life in the outer solar system
It happened 225 years ago.
What they remember is , of course , the great triumph , that the Brits were beaten , and we won , and that the country was born.
I wanted to just talk for one minute about the future of biotechnology , because I think I know very little about that -- I ' m not a biologist -- so everything I know about it can be said in one minute.
When people have this technology in their hands , you have a do-it-yourself biotech kit , grow your own -- grow your dog , grow your own cat.
And I ' m interested in searching for life in the universe.
It has a fairly substantial number of asteroids between the orbit of the Earth out through -- to the orbit of Jupiter.
There stand some interesting places a little further out : the moons of Jupiter and Saturn.
Ocean -- probably the most likely place for life to originate , just as it originated on the Earth . So we would love to explore Europa , to go down through the ice , find out who is swimming around in the ocean , whether there are fish or seaweed or sea monsters -- whatever there may be that ' s exciting --- or cephalopods.
There are plans to do it , but it ' s hard.
So , what I ' m proposing is that there is where we should be looking for life , rather than on Mars , although Mars is , of course , also a very promising and interesting place.
It ' s quite likely that it would move out of the ocean onto the surface , just as it did on the Earth.
There wouldn ' t have been any air there -- it ' s a vacuum.
They ' d need , first of all , to have a thick skin to protect themselves from losing water through the skin.
So they would have to have -- these creatures , which I call sunflowers , which I imagine living on the surface of Europa , would have to have either lenses or mirrors to concentrate sunlight , so they could keep themselves warm on the surface.
So , why not look ?  Of course , it ' s not very likely that there ' s life on the surface of Europa.
And the regular astronomers were scornful about this.
Since there was nothing there , you might as well not look.
There is something called pit lamping.
You strap it onto your forehead , so you can see the reflection in the eyes of the animal . So , if you go out at night , you shine a flashlight , the animals are bright.
So , the farmers go out at night with heavily armed jeeps , and shine the headlights , and anything that doesn ' t look like a sheep , you shoot.
And then , when you shine sunlight at them , the sunlight will be reflected back , just as it is in the eyes of an animal.
So , in fact , you can look for these creatures with telescopes from the Earth.
Because it means that -- the way life can live out there , it has enormous advantages as compared with living on a planet.
But if you live in a vacuum , if you live on the surface of one of these objects , say , in the Kuiper Belt , this -- an object like Pluto , or one of the smaller objects in the neighborhood of Pluto , and you happened -- if you ' re living on the surface there , and you get knocked off the surface by a collision , then it doesn ' t change anything all that much.
They look like , maybe like sunflowers.
So , I hope in the next 10 years , we ' ll find these creatures , and then , of course , our whole view of life in the universe will change.
That would be a fun thing to do.
We transform the universe into something much more rich and beautiful than it is today.
culture,social change,third world,women
Given my TED profile , you might be expecting that I ' m going to speak to you about the latest philanthropic trends -- the one that ' s currently got Wall Street and the World Bank buzzing -- how to invest in women , how to empower them , how to save them.
In the midst of the daunting challenges we face as a global community , there ' s something about this third way raga that is making my heart sing.
When so many women and girls are beaten , raped , maimed on a daily basis in the name of all kinds of causes -- honor , religion , nationality -- what allows women to replant trees , to rebuild societies , to lead radical , non-violent movements for social change ? 
And what , if anything , do men have to do with it ? 
Among those who ' ve helped open my eyes to a third way are : a devout Muslim in Afghanistan , a group of harmonizing lesbians in Croatia and a taboo breaker in Liberia.
But you ' re young , you could still try again. " 
They took off her colorful sari.
Her daughter , Rani , a few years older than me , sat in her lap bewildered , not knowing what had happened to the confident woman she once knew as her mother.
That ' s the night I learned the rules about what it means to be female in this world.
By 18 , under the excellent tutelage of my mother , I was therefore , as you might expect , defiantly feminist.
Soon after I returned from Beijing , I leapt at the chance to work for this wonderful organization , founded by women , to support women ' s rights organizations around the globe.
She said to me ,  " It is not about the burka. " 
The prophet wanted every believer to be able to read the Koran for themselves. " 
She always wears a headscarf , but I ' ve walked alongside with her on a beach with her long hair flying in the breeze.
When I had to open the school in the refugee camp , I went to see the imam.
And after he would leave , women and girls would stay behind.
She is on the Taliban ' s hit list.
Look at those young girls who go back to school when acid is thrown in their face. " 
To be a lesbian , a dyke , a homosexual in most parts of the world , including right here in our country , India , is to occupy a place of immense discomfort and extreme prejudice.
Many are in their 20s , some are mothers.
So Lesbor , we blend the two.
Their repertoire includes the Croatian national anthem , a Bosnian love song and Serbian duets.
In the Middle Ages , troubadours would travel across the land singing their tales and sharing their verses : Lesbor travels through the Balkans like this , singing , connecting people divided by religion , nationality and language.
Liberia had been torn apart by civil strife for decades.
She dreamt she and thousands of other women ended the bloodshed.
Among Layma ' s friends was a policewoman who was Muslim.
This small group of women , determined to bring an end to the war , and they chose to use their traditions to make a point : Liberian women usually wear lots of jewelry and colorful clothing.
They stood for weeks -- first just 10 , then 20 , then 50 , then hundreds of women -- wearing white , singing , dancing , saying they were out for peace.
With their remaining funds , they took a small group of women down to the venue of the peace talks and they surrounded the building.
The police are called in to physically remove the women.
And the next thing you know , the police have disappeared.
We were not going to leave until the peace accord was signed. " 
Women like Sakena and Leah and Layma have humbled me and changed me and made me realize that I should not be so quick to jump to assumptions of any kind.
The protests , the marches , the uncompromising position that women ' s rights are human rights , full stop.
And in most parts of the world , that top is still controlled by men.
And they need allies from their communities.
So that , as Eleanor Roosevelt said once of human rights , the same is true of gender equality : that it starts in small places , close to home.
They are saying , we don ' t have to be like you to make change.
It is in these little stories , these individual stories , that I see a radical epic being written by women around the world.
http://www.ted.com/talks/hannah_brencher_love_letters_to_strangers.html
Hannah Brencher : Love letters to strangers
I wrote those same kinds of letters that my mother had written me for strangers , and tucked them all throughout the city , dozens and dozens of them . I left them everywhere , in cafes and in libraries , at the U.N. , everywhere.
But , you know , the thing that always gets me about these letters is that most of them have been written by people that have never known themselves loved on a piece of paper.
But what if it ' s not about efficiency this time ? 
And I thought ,  " Well , sir , I am not a strategist , nor am I specialist . I am merely a storyteller. " 
Or the man who decides that he is going to take his life , uses Facebook as a way to say goodbye to friends and family.
We still clutch close these letters to our chest , to the words that speak louder than loud , when we turn pages into palettes to say the things that we have needed to say , the words that we have needed to write , to sisters and brothers and even to strangers , for far too long.

In essence , could we  " app "  chemistry ? 
Now what could this mean ? 
And so the really cool bit is , the idea is that we want to have a universal set of inks that we put out with the printer , and you download the blueprint , the organic chemistry for that molecule and you make it in the device.
And this is what we ' re doing in the lab at the moment.
We can print drugs at point of need.
So this allows you on-the-fly molecular assembly.
Beam me up , Scotty.

And I did that ; I put on my ritualistic dress ; I went to the holy mosque ; I did my prayers ; I observed all the rituals.
They were together while doing the tawaf , the circular walk around the Kaaba.
And I noticed this in a very funny way.
And I had to pay , order and eat at the male section.
Because the Kaaba and the rituals around it are relics from the earliest phase of Islam , that of prophet Muhammad.
This is also , I think , confirmed by the fact that the seclusion of women in creating a divided society is something that you also do not find in the Koran , the very core of Islam -- the divine core of Islam that all Muslims , and equally myself , believe.
And actually this is just one example of a much larger phenomenon.
And there are two important messages , or two lessons , to take from that reality.
Maybe it ' s a Middle Eastern culture that became confused with Islam.
And Westerners , Europeans or Americans , who didn ' t know about this before faced this practice within some of the Muslim communities who migrated from North Africa.
And quite tellingly , some Muslims do practice that.
The same thing can be said for honor killings , which is a recurrent theme in the Western media -- and which is , of course , a horrible tradition.
Now these are things about general culture , but I ' m also very much interested in political culture and whether liberty and democracy is appreciated , or whether there ' s an authoritarian political culture in which the state is supposed to impose things on the citizens.
Now that is pretty authoritarian , and that ' s something I ' m very much critical of.
It should be the citizen ' s decision.
Now these are some of the questions I had in mind a few years ago when I sat down to write a book.
And there are strengths in Islamic tradition.
But one thing was curious : most of those problems turn out to be problems that emerged later , not from the very divine core of Islam , the Koran , but from , again , traditions and mentalities , or the interpretations of the Koran that Muslims made in the Middle Ages.
These things which make Islamic Law , the troubling aspects of Islamic Law , were later developed into later interpretations of Islam.
Now we are living in a different world with different values and different political systems. " 
Actually , from the 19th century on , there ' s a whole revisionist , reformist -- whatever you call it -- tradition , a trend in Islamic thinking.
They said ,  " Why don ' t we have these things ?  " 
And that ' s why the Ottoman Empire in its last decades turned into a proto-democracy , a constitutional monarchy , and freedom was a very important political value at the time.
But there is a very curious pattern in the rest of the 20th century , because we see a sharp decline in this Islamic modernist line.
But there is a curious question : If Islamic modernism was so popular in the 19th and early 20th centuries , why did Islamism become so popular in the rest of the 20th century ? 
You just look at the political history of the 20th century , and you see things have changed a lot.
And when you have colonization what do you have ? 
And when the colonial period ended , what you had in place of that was , generally , secular dictators , which say they ' re a country , but did not bring democracy to the country , and established their own dictatorship.
There was one country , though , which was able to escape or stay away from that vicious cycle.
They did not share the same anti-colonial hype that you can find in some other countries in the region.
And they realize that democracy is something that is compatible with Islam , compatible with their values , and they ' ve been supportive of democracy.
And they look at Europe , and they see an example , again , to follow.
But the pro-E.U . sentiment in Turkey in the past decade has become almost an Islamic cause and supported by the Islamic liberals and the secular liberals as well , of course.
And Arab masses just revolted against their dictators.
We are Muslim believers , but we want to be living as free people in free societies. " 
And I believe that the Islamic modernism which began in the 19th century , but which had a setback in the 20th century because of the political troubles of the Muslim world , is having a rebirth.

I wanted to visualize the story of life.
I went down to a remote lagoon in Australia , hoping to see the Earth the way it was three billion years ago , back before the sky turned blue.
Stromatolites are the heroes in my story.
Our journey starts in space , where matter condenses into spheres over time ...
Heat from within made geysers erupt -- that is how the oceans were born.
But this planet is different -- it ' s roiling inside.
Learn to multiply , thickening in places ...
A breath that ' s fossilized now as iron.
circuit boards of the future.
It learned to move and began to see . The first eyes grew on trilobites.
Fish tried amphibian life . Frogs adapted to deserts.
Once they learn how to stay upright , they grew in size and shape.
Leatherbacks and tuataras are echoes from that era.
Jurassic Park still shimmers in part of Madagascar , and the center of Brazil , where plants called  " cycads "  remain rock hard.
In birds , life gained new mobility.
Plants began to diversify and grew , turning into trees.
Tropical rainforests arose , sparking new layers of interdependence.
When birds can ' t fly , they become vulnerable.
But there were witnesses , survivors in the dark.
New predators , hyenas , getting faster and faster still.
Some mammals turned back to water.
Primates emerge from jungles , as tarsiers first , becoming lemurs not much later.
We ' re molded by the same life force.
And it has altered the Earth . It covers Earth like a skin.
The whole animal world today lives on a stockpile of bacterial oxygen that is cycled constantly through plants and algae , and their waste is our breath , and vice versa.
Thank you . Thank you.

Yet , not only is there at least some good news to be told about fewer such conflicts now than two decades ago , but what is perhaps more important is that we also have come to a much better understanding of what can be done to further reduce the number of ethnic conflicts and civil wars and the suffering that they inflict.
Civil wars have made news headlines for many decades now , and ethnic conflicts in particular have been a near constant presence as a major international security threat.
In Kenya , contested presidential elections in 2007 -- we just heard about them -- quickly led to high levels of inter-ethnic violence and the killing and displacement of thousands of people.
In the Middle East , conflict between Israelis and Palestinians continues unabated , and it becomes ever more difficult to see how , just how a possible , sustainable solution can be achieved.
So are these now the images of the past ? 
The number of people killed in civil wars also is much lower today than it was a decade ago or two.
Despite the up and down since then , the overall trend -- and this is the important bit -- clearly points downward for the past two decades.
This decline would be even more obvious if we factored in the genocide in Rwanda in 1994.
They exclude people that died as a consequence of civil war , from hunger or disease , for example.
Thus , even though every civilian killed , maimed , raped , or tortured is one too many , the fact that the number of civilian casualties is clearly lower today than it was a decade ago , is good news.
This is a solution of sorts , but rarely is it one that comes without human costs or humanitarian consequences.
But for many parts of Africa , a colleague of mine once put it this way ,  " The cease-fire on Tuesday night was reached just in time for the genocide to start on Wednesday morning. " 
Despite centuries of animosity , decades of violence and thousands of people killed , 1998 saw the conclusion of an historic agreement.
Subsequent revisions of the agreement were facilitated by the British and Irish governments , who never wavered in their determination to bring peace and stability to Northern Ireland.
The provisions in the agreement may be complex , but so is the underlying conflict.
By no means.
The hopes that were vested in the Oslo Accords did not lead to an end of the Israeli/Palestinian conflict.
The comprehensive peace agreement for Sudan signed in 2005 turned out to be less comprehensive than envisaged , and its provisions may yet bear the seeds of a full-scale return to war between north and south.
The failure to achieve a negotiated solution for Kosovo and the violence , tension and de facto partition that resulted from it have their reasons in many , many different factors.
And third , a lack of imagination when it came to designing institutions that could have addressed the concerns of Serbs and Albanians alike.
Good news is also about learning the right lesson.
In the same way in which ethnic conflict and civil war are not natural but man-made disasters , their prevention and settlement does not happen automatically either.
Diplomacy needs to be well resourced , sustained , and apply the right mix of incentives and pressures on leaders and followers.
Conflict parties need to move away from maximum demands and towards a compromise that recognizes each other ' s needs.
Yet , no amount of diplomacy or institutional design can make up for local failures and the consequences that they have.
It often takes a generation to accomplish , but it also requires us , today ' s generation , to take responsibility and to learn the right lessons about leadership , diplomacy and institutional design , so that the child soldiers of today can become the children of tomorrow.

They ' re discoveries of people and the way people are , and new leadership.
Benki comes from a village so remote up in the Amazon that to get there , either you have to fly and land on water , or go by canoe for several days.
Today ' s biggest threat to the Ashaninka people and to Benki comes from illegal logging -- the people who come into the beautiful forest and cut down ancient mahogany trees , float them down the river to world markets.
And at that young age , 10 years old , Benki became the paje of his community.
He began to talk to them about the forest that they needed to protect , the way of life they needed to nurture.
And he went because he hoped the world would listen.
Benki came back to his village full of ideas -- new technologies , new research , new ways of understanding what was going on.
He ' s created a cooperative to help people diversify their livelihoods.
Why are you making yourself vulnerable to what is often a hostile world ?  " 
For me , the world is veering towards a future we don ' t much want when we really think about it deep inside.
We ' re running out of fossil fuels.
And we know that there will be more of us than ever before -- five times as many people in 40 years than 60 years ago.
And in addition to that , we know that five other really big countries are going to have a say in the future , a say we haven ' t even really started to hear yet -- China , India , Russia , South Africa and Benki ' s own Brazil , where Benki got his civil rights only in the 1988 constitution.
And this reminds me of something I understand Lord Salisbury said to Queen Victoria over a hundred years ago , when she was pressing him ,  " Please change. " 
We have to change.
I started life as a banker.
This is Sanghamitra.
But she realized that she was much too detached from the world doing that.
But if you just think about the state of the world and knowledge of HIV/AIDS in 1993 -- in India at that time it was skyrocketing and nobody understood why , and everyone was actually very , very afraid.
not an obvious path , she said to me ,  " It ' s all connected.
Even that wasn ' t enough.
She works with people like Murali Krishna.
He ' s a Leaders '  Quest fellow , and that helps him with his work.
Sanghamitra told me just last week -- she had just come back from two weeks in the villages , and she had a real breakthrough.
If you are lucky enough to meet Sanghamitra and ask her why and how , how have you achieved so much ? 
Jianchuan comes from Sichuan Province in southwest China.
He would tell you ,  " I ' m a collector , and I curate a museum. " 
Over a lifetime , through everything , through the Cultural Revolution and everything afterward , he ' s kept collecting , so that he now has over eight million pieces in his museums documenting contemporary Chinese history.
Because he thought a nation should never repeat the mistakes of the past.
He has nine other buildings -- that are already open to the public -- filled to the rafters with artifacts documenting contemporary Chinese history.
They looked outside , and then they changed what was on the inside.
They have drive , passion , commitment.
They have a sense of the great arc of time and their tiny place in it.
And they have humility.
So I think we need succession planning on a global basis.
But the good news is that we don ' t have to figure it out as we go along ; we have models , we have examples , like Benki and Sanghamitra and Jianchuan.
And if we ' re lucky , we can change the way our great-grandchildren will answer Benki ' s question.

Kartikeya leapt on his peacock and flew around the continents and the mountains and the oceans.
And Ganesha said ,  " You went around  ' the world. '  I went around  ' my world. '  "  What matters more ? 
It ' s emotional . It ' s personal.
 ' The world '  tells us how the world functions , how the sun rises , how we are born.
Culture is a reaction to nature , and this understanding of our ancestors is transmitted generation from generation in the form of stories , symbols and rituals , which are always indifferent to rationality.
Yours is faith.

We don ' t know who he was.
and the gymnosophist answered ,  " I ' m experiencing nothingness. " 
Each one thought that the other was a fool.
What a waste of a life. " 
 " Achilles was a man who could shape history , a man of destiny , and this is what you should be , Alexander. " 
Don ' t live a life which is monotonous , mediocre , meaningless.
Because , you see , the Greeks believed you live only once , and when you die , you have to cross the River Styx.
He heard of a man called Bharat , after whom India is called Bhārata.
But when he reached the mountain peak , he found the peak covered with countless flags of world-conquerors before him , each one claiming  "  ' I was here first '  ...
You see , he had heroes , like Ram -- Raghupati Ram and Krishna , Govinda Hari.
When Ram dies , Krishna is born.
You go to and fro endlessly.
And so , you have these grand rituals where great images of mother goddesses are built and worshiped for 10 days ...
And next year , she will come back.
 " Groundhog Day. " 
One linear , one cyclical.
So , the value of his life was the sum total of his achievements.
Who knows ? 
And if you look at cultures around the world , all you have to do is understand the mythology and you will see how they behave and how they do business.
You look at art . Look at the ballerina , how linear she is in her performance.
Sounds very much like the journey through the wilderness to the promised land , with the commandments held by the leader.
You see , businesses are not run as institutions , by the idiosyncrasies of individuals.
There is no orchestra conductor.
It ' s about conversation and faith.
So , it ' s rapidly changing , highly diverse , chaotic , ambiguous , unpredictable.
Which is rooted in one-life culture.
I did not want to study surgery . Don ' t ask me why.
And mythology does not pay , well , until now.
I even was a business consultant , doing strategies and tactics.
How do you parameterize  " mostly "  ? 
You see , he has established the largest retail chain , called Big Bazaar.
He knew that institutional thinking doesn ' t work in India . Individual thinking does.
But belief is not measurable.
Even if you are Indian , it is not very explicit , it is not very obvious.
Hindus don ' t have the concept of commandments.
You want to see God.
 " Why did I do the setting , why I don ' t care for the processes . Just understand me , please. " 
And invariably , you see a tear , because the penny has dropped.
And it has.
So , I will not answer the question.
They are cultural creations , not natural phenomena.
You will discover that within infinite myths lies the eternal truth.
You and I , only two.

And mostly what good dads should be doing this time of year is nestling with their kids and decorating the Christmas tree.
You know , I found that volcano on Google Images , not realizing how much it makes me look like the cover of Dianetics.
Now , it works just like a regular phone.
So that ' s really cool -- you can take it to London or Siberia , and your next door neighbor can dial your home number and your phone will ring , because it ' s got everything in the box.
This is what college kids are more likely to have . It ' s the most popular VOIP service in the world : It ' s Skype.
It ' s really cute seeing middle-aged people like me , try out Skype for the first time , which is usually when their kid goes away for a semester abroad.
Imagine if you had an ordinary cell phone , and any time you were in a wireless hotspot -- free calls anywhere in the world , never pay the cellular company a nickel.
And it ' s so interesting that I thought I would tell you about it.
The New York Times has very rigid policies about that.
It was the iPhone . The iPhone came out that day.
The deal is , any time you ' re in a Wi-Fi hotspot , all your calls are free.
Because they give you a regular wireless router that works with the phone , for your house.
They don ' t have that kind of money . Instead they give each of us a seven-dollar-and-95-cent box . They ' re like a stealth tower installation program.
This is me with a camcorder on a phone going like this.
JP : Oh , hi darling , how are you ? 
JP : No not at all . I ' m having a great day with the kids.
I don ' t know why my wife says I never listen to her . I don ' t get that.
Because they don ' t , they haven ' t -- well , no , wait! Not so fast.
Now you get it.
This is another favorite of mine.
I should know not to do technology demos in front of an audience . It ' s just , like , absurd.
Hello ? 
Oh great! Yeah . Yeah you can all stop calling now!
I have your numbers now!
The beauty of that is you never miss a call.
And then your wife calls , and ,  " Hi honey , leave me a message. " 
By the way , this is something that really bothers me.
I ' m going to tell you how to avoid that now.
I ' m about to change your life . So here ' s me doing it.
You type  " pharmacy Chicago, "  or the zip code.
It works with weather , too.
Here we go . And those are just the beginning.
So I ' m going to teach you something even better.
So lets say I ' m in Monterey , and I want what ? 
I got the Chinese line.
Number two : Bagel Bakery , commissary department.
Google : .. . commissary department on McClellan Avenue , Monterey.
Google : Hold on.
It ' s just so amazing.
Who won the 1958 World Series ? 
 " Which actors have played James Bond ?  " 
Just to see how the recognition was.
They put this teeny-weeny little ad , about 10 characters long.
They have 10,000 people who are being paid 20 cents per answer.
You know . It ' s just absolutely amazing.
Nobody has pagers anymore.
To listen to your messages .. .  "  Why else am I calling ? 
And I said as a joke -- as a joke , I said ,  " I did the math . Verizon has 70 million customers.
Sorry . I ' m not bitter.
It is a life-changer.
I don ' t really want people listening in to my calls. " 
The other was from my video producer at the Times , whose name is Vijaiy Singh , with the silent  ' h '  . Nailed that one.
So I thought I ' d see how that goes.
Hey , I was walking along the street and the sky was blue.
OK , talk to you later -- bye.
So it had better be the gist of the gist , right ? 
And lastly , I just have to talk about this one.
And you ' re like ,  " I ' m sorry . I ' ve got to take this. " 
Phone : Hey you , what ' s going on ? 
Phone : I was just wondering what you were up to.
DP : Oh , hi , sir.
DP : It was like three weeks ago.
I looked like a moron . However , my logic was good , because -- I don ' t know if you realize this , but -- until the iPhone came along , the carriers -- Verizon , AT&T , Cingular -- held veto power over every aspect of every design of every phone.
It was not very conducive to innovation.
I ' m going to talk about the effect of the iPhone.
It ' s got bad things and good things . Lets all acknowledge that right now.
Another thing was that it let 10 million people , for the first time , experience being online all the time.
 " We had wireless base stations that could broadcast -- yay , about 150 feet across. " 
You have to go to YouTube and type in  " iPhone Shuffle. " 
 " Who the hell is this ?  " 
These programs can use all the components of the iPhone -- the touch screen.
Right , of course . We shake it to erase , like this.
This is amazing . This is Midomi.
This is Pandora . Free Internet radio . Not just free Internet radio -- you type in a band or a song name.
If you like it , it tries another song on you from a different band , with the same instrumentation , vocals , theme and tempo.
You want to find a place to eat . You shake it.
Anyway , just amazing , amazing things.
Touch screen -- very , very nice.
So everything is changing . We ' ve entered a new world of innovation , where the cell phone becomes your laptop , customized the way you want it.
It ' s only three pounds , or 12 if you install Microsoft Office.
And now the end is near.
I ' ve heard there ' s something new -- a million times more rad than my phone.
No keys , no memory card , the battery ' s sealed -- you can ' t replace it.
I want to touch its precious screen.
For what is a man ? 
I took a stand , paid half a grand!
Working with a team of physicists , Dr . Deborah Rhodes developed a new tool for tumor detection that ' s 3 times as effective as traditional mammograms for women with dense breast tissue . The life-saving implications are stunning . So why haven ' t we heard of it ?  Rhodes shares the story behind the tool ' s creation , and the web of politics and economics that keep it from mainstream use.
There are two groups of women when it comes to screening mammography -- women in whom mammography works very well and has saved thousands of lives and women in whom it doesn ' t work well at all.
The truth has become lost in all the rhetoric coming from the press , politicians , radiologists and medical imaging companies.
I ' m not a radiologist.
Her sister had been diagnosed with breast cancer in her 40s.
So I studied her mammogram , and I reviewed the radiology literature , and I was shocked to discover that , in her case , our chances of finding a tumor early on the mammogram were less than the toss of a coin.
Radiologists were outraged by the guidelines.
There ' s a shortage of radiologists qualified to read mammograms , and that ' s because mammograms are one of the most complex of all radiology studies to interpret , and because radiologists are sued more often over missed breast cancer than any other cause.
Breast density refers to the relative amount of fat -- pictured here in yellow -- versus connective and epithelial tissues -- pictured in pink.
So how do you know if your breasts are dense ? 
The next category is scattered fibroglandular densities , followed by heterogeneously dense and extremely dense.
So it ' s easy to see this tumor in the upper part of this fatty breast.
It ' s a stronger risk factor than having a mother or a sister with breast cancer.
There have been surprisingly few innovations , until digital mammography was approved in 2000.
But it was better in one group , and that was women under 50 who were pre-menopausal and had dense breasts , and in those women , digital mammography found twice as many cancers , but it still only found 60 percent.
And MRI is exquisitely sensitive for finding tumors , but it ' s also very expensive.
The machines get ever bigger and ever more expensive.
And sooner or later , we ' re going to have to accept the fact that health care innovation can ' t always come at a much higher price.
He quotes one innovator who says ,  " The only time a physician and a physicist get together is when the physicist gets sick. " 
So if you will allow me a little creative license , I will tell you the story of the serendipitous collision of my patient ' s problem with a physicist ' s solution.
But the problem was that the gamma detectors were these huge , bulky tubes , and they were filled with these scintillating crystals , and you just couldn ' t get them close enough around the breast to find small tumors.
But Michael told me about a new type of gamma detector that he ' d seen , and this is it.
This is an image from our first patient.
To say that we faced high doses of skepticism in those early years is just a huge understatement , but we were so convinced that we might be able to make this work that we chipped away with incremental modifications to this system.
So how does this work ? 
After the injection , the patient ' s breast is placed between the detectors.
And the detector then transmits the image to the computer.
In this example , although the mammogram found one tumor , we were able to demonstrate three discrete tumors -- one is small as three millimeters.
Of the tumors that we found , mammography found only 25 percent of those tumors.
In this case , a one-centimeter tumor.
But fortunately it was removed before it had spread to her lymph nodes.
And at this low dose , we ' re continuing this screening study , and this image from three weeks ago in a 67-year-old woman shows a normal digital mammogram , but an MBI image showing an uptake that proved to be a large cancer.
MBI generates four images per breast.
But this is why MBI is so potentially disruptive -- it ' s as accurate as MRI , it ' s far less complex to interpret , and it ' s a fraction of the cost.
Our manuscript was then accepted and will be published later this month in the journal Radiology.
The MBI unit has now been FDA approved , but it ' s not yet widely available.
The State of Connecticut became the first and only state to mandate that women receive notification of their breast density after a mammogram.
Second , if you ' re pre-menopausal , try to schedule your mammogram in the first two weeks of your menstrual cycle , when breast density is relatively lower.
But this mortality banner is the very sword which mammography ' s most ardent advocates use to deter innovation.
It is time for us to accept both the extraordinary successes of mammography and the limitations.
The babies that we were carrying when my patient first asked me this question are now both in middle school , and the answer has been so slow to come.

Mathieu Lehanneur demos science-inspired design
Basically the homunculus is the visualization of a human being where each part of the body is proportional to the surface it takes in the brain.
This visualization could explain , for example , why newborns , or smokers , put , instinctively , their fingers in the mouth.
And it really helps me to understand how we see , how we hear , how we breathe , how our brain can inform or mislead us.
Marketing creates user groups.
In our daily life we are continuously disturbed by aggressive sounds.
Or neither with including complex technology.
This is white noise.
It is the perfect sound for our ears and our brain.
It seems to be magic.
It works.
So even if this object , even if this product includes some technology , it includes some speakers , it includes some microphones and some electronic devices , this object is not a very smart object.
So , definitely not perfect.
And D.B . will probably roll toward you.
K is a daylight receiver transmitter.
And the idea of those fiber opticals is to inform the object , for sure , but creates the idea of an eye sensibility of the object.
So , a huge problem.
And I submit them , my intuitions , my hypothesis , my first ideas.
And this kind of relationship between designer and scientist started when I was at school.
Anyway , this project , or this experience , make me start a new project on the design of medicine.
We took irregular dosage.
I ' m going to give you some example.
So , you start with the darkest one.
And you have to peel and eat one layer a day.
And here you can get the white core.
So the idea of this one is to create a relationship between the patient of the treatment but a relationship of dependency.
And when the kids wake up , he can see the object needs him . And he take him to his mouth , and breathe the air it contains.
We could talk about a kind of soul , of a ghost compelling them.
And John Maeda was supposed to show several graphic animations in this exhibition.
And John was so excited by this idea . He said to me ,  " Okay let ' s go. " 
And he told me , after a long silence ,  " I wonder , Mathieu , if people won ' t be more fascinated by your benches than by my videos. " 
Pinocchio is probably one of my best design products , my favorite one.
And it was singing all day long . And when it stops it means that it just died.
And I tried to design a kind of canary.
You have to know , or you probably already know , that indoor air pollution is more toxic than outdoor one.
And this is exactly the same at home.
This is the reason why I created , with David Edward , a scientist of Harvard University , an object able to absorb the toxic elements using those kind of plants.
So the idea is to create an object able to force the air , and to be in contact at the right speed at the right place , in all the effective parts of the plant.
And in this one , plants are used for the water filtration ability.
So the idea of this object is to be able to get at home very local food.
And the aquaponics is the dirty water of the fish , by a water pump , feeds the plants above.
Or you sit down in front of it like you would do in front your TV set.
Because you can grow some potatoes.
Now we can be treated by smart medicine.
I wanted to create a perfect place where you can work and play , and where your body and your brain can work together.
In this office you do not work and write and draw on a sheet of paper , but you draw directly on a kind of huge whiteboard cave , like a prehistoric scientist.
You can see it there.
Just for my workshop.
http://www.ted.com/talks/damon_horowitz.html
Damon Horowitz calls for a  " moral operating system " 
We have a lot of data , so we have a lot of power.
The way we ' re going to do this is fly him in and drop him off.
That ' s the kind of power I feel in this room.
What can we do with that guy ' s data ? 
I can look at your medical records ; I can see if your pump is still pumping -- see if you ' re good to offer insurance to.
I can tell with data analysis what you ' re going to do before you even do it.
I ' m here to talk about what we should do.
Fair enough.
We want the people building the technology thinking about what we should be doing with the technology.
So we can protect ourselves if he was up to no good ? 
I know : crowdsource . Let ' s crowdsource this.
Android.
Or should we leave him alone ? 
Okay , last question -- harder question -- when trying to evaluate what we should do in this case , should we use a Kantian deontological moral framework , or should we use a Millian consequentialist one ? 
Yeah , that ' s a terrifying result.
What ' s a moral operating system ? 
But how do we figure out what ' s right and wrong ? 
Or maybe we punt -- ask the legal department , see what they say.
We ' re numbers people , living by numbers.
Plato , that ' s right.
He was worried about right and wrong.
It ' s kind of convincing when he talks and when she talks too.
In math , we know the objective facts.
If you ' ve got two of something , you add two more , you get four.
They all participate in the truths that two has.
What if there were a pure form of justice ? 
That ' s a stunning vision.
He wants objective truths.
He thought it was impractical.
If you think that , Plato ' s not your guy.
That sound familiar ? 
The three people who voted for Mill before are familiar with this.
It ' s not like its relation to some abstract form.
Let ' s take an example.
And what if he ' s been sending little messages to Bin Laden ' s hideout -- or whoever took over after Bin Laden -- and he ' s actually like a terrorist , a sleeper cell.
If you feel that way , that ' s a utilitarian choice.
He has autonomy.
He said we should use our reason to figure out the rules by which we should guide our conduct , and then it is our duty to follow those rules.
And this goes on for thousands of years , because these are hard questions , and I ' ve only got 15 minutes.
What should we be doing ?  What ' s the answer ? 
There ' s not a simple answer.
I know ; I spent a lot of my career in artificial intelligence , trying to build machines that could do some of this thinking for us , that could give us answers.
Happily , we ' re not machines , and we can do it.
That ' s what she called the  " banality of evil. " 
Every person in this room do this : think of the last time you had a decision to make where you were worried to do the right thing , where you wondered ,  " What should I be doing ?  " 
Or now we have a few more choices.
It is so important we are going to spend 30 seconds of valuable TEDTalk time doing nothing but thinking about this.
Now the next step -- try this.
And don ' t just find another technologist friend ; find somebody different than you.
Just a few days ago , right across the street from here , there was hundreds of people gathered together.
You ' re thinking about the relevance of 17th century French theater -- how does that bear upon venture capital ? 
And you ' re telling him what we ' re talking about , about our whole data revolution and all this -- maybe even hum a few bars of our theme music.
That ' s interesting.
We care what happens in that opera.
We ' re the ones writing this opera.
http://www.ted.com/talks/steven_levitt_analyzes_crack_economics.html
Steven Levitt analyzes crack economics
There was money , there was drugs , guns , women , you know , you name it -- jewelry , bling-bling -- it had it all.
So there are three things I want to do.
And then third , I want to tell you , in a very superficial way , about some of the things we found when we actually got to look at the financial records -- the books -- of the gang.
So let me start by talking about crack cocaine , and how it transformed the gang.
Now , you had a lot of power , and you got to beat people up -- you got a lot of prestige , a lot of respect.
You couldn ' t really make any money selling marijuana.
You know , cocaine ' s a great product -- powdered cocaine -- but you ' ve got to know rich white people.
So , as a result , as a gang leader , you had , you know , power -- it ' s a pretty good life -- but the thing was , in the end , you were living at home with your mother.
And in the words of Malcolm Gladwell , crack cocaine was the extra-chunky version of tomato sauce for the inner city.
And for the worse -- not for the better , but for the worse.
Because you could smoke crack cocaine -- you can ' t smoke powdered cocaine -- and smoking is a much more efficient mechanism at delivering a high than is snorting it.
So for fifteen minutes , you get this great high.
At least for the people in the top.
So he was a math major in college who had a good heart , and decided he wanted to get a sociology Ph.D. , came to the University of Chicago.
Big man , and he had hair , in his words ,  " down to his ass. " 
And the famous sociologist , William Julius Wilson , was doing a book that involved surveying people all across Chicago.
Gets to the first building.
This is about 1990 -- peak of the crack epidemic.
Now , Sudhir was lucky.
Makes you wonder about academics , OK ? 
There was a lot of gunfire ; there were a lot of philosophical discussions he had with the gang members.
I ' ve been following them for the last three months.
And that was the beginning of what turned out to be a beautiful relationship that involved Sudhir living in the housing project on and off for 10 years : hanging out in crack houses , going to jail with the gang members , having the car-windows shot out of his car , having the police break into his apartment and steal his computer disks -- you name it.
So what do we find ?  What do we find in the gang ?  Well , let me say one thing.
And they made them available to us.
So first , in one way -- which isn ' t maybe the most interesting way , but it ' s a good way to start -- is in the way it ' s organized -- the hierarchy of the gang , the way it looks.
And Sudhir says it ' s not like these guys had a very sophisticated kind of view of like , what happened in American corporate life.
Which , it turned out , for this black gang , was not one of the more brilliant financial endeavors that they undertook.
They get the exclusive property rights to control the drug-selling.
These are the teenagers , typically , who ' d be standing out on the street corner , selling the drugs.
So in some sense , the foot soldiers are a lot like the people who are taking your order at McDonald ' s.
Which already , I think , foreshadows the main result that I ' ve talked about , about what a crappy job it was being in the gang.
The hourly wage the foot soldiers were earning was $3.50 in an hour.
There was very little money in the gang , especially at the bottom.
Truly , you would be a great success story.
And it actually was the right choice , probably , to try to make it out -- this way.
Well , the reason it ' s such a bad job is that there ' s somebody shooting at you a lot of the time.
You ' re in the gang for four years ; you expect to die with about a 25 percent likelihood.
It turns out , the death rates on death row -- from all causes , including execution -- two percent a year.
That ' s extremely high.
So why in the world , you might ask , would anybody be willing to stand out on a street corner selling drugs for $3.50 an hour , with a 25 percent chance of dying over the next four years ? 
That the young people controlled the gang -- that , as you got older , you dropped out of the gang.
The first set of people in Silicon Valley got very , very rich.
Just like , say , a lawyer at a law firm -- a first-year lawyer is wiling to start at the bottom , work 80-hour weeks for not that much money , because they think they ' re going to make partner.
So everybody got stuck at that $3.50-an-hour job , and it turned out to be a disaster.
They just leased them -- because they couldn ' t afford to own the fancy cars.
So for instance , they would give a 14-year-old kid -- they ' d give him a whole , you know , roll of bills to hold.
So I have a couple minutes.
But actually , what ' s kind of interesting is that in this setting it turned out that some of the economic theories that worked not so well in the real economy worked very well in the drug economy -- in some sense because it ' s unfettered capitalism.
It ' s why we think garbage men might be paid more than people who work in parks , OK ? 
It ' s exactly this concept.
So if I going to be asked to put my life on the line , then front me the cash , man. " 
Here ' s the translation you get from the gang member.
He says ,  " If we start shooting around there, "  -- in the other gang ' s territory --  " nobody , and , I mean , you dig it , nobody , going to step on their turf.
So one thing we observed in the data is that it looked like , in terms of ...
But then we asked the gang member ,  " Well , why is it you always get paid , and your workers don ' t always get paid ?  " 
And it never would really occur to an economist that this idea of  ' weak and shit '  could really be important. "

Paragliding is taking off from mountains with a paraglider , with the possibility to fly cross-country , distance , just with the use of thermals to soar.
From regular , relative skydiving I went on to freeflying.
And that ' s me in the background , carving around the whole formation in freefall also , with the helmet cam to film this jump.
Of course I can use this power for example for nice spinning -- we call it  " helicopter moves. " 
With a proper body position I ' m able to really move forward to gain quite some distance.
BASE jumping is skydiving from fixed objects , like buildings , antennae , bridges and earth -- meaning mountains , cliffs.
Two years after this , I was the first to BASE jump from Matterhorn , a very famous mountain that probably everybody knows in here.
So with all this knowledge , I also wanted to get into stunts.
Or this jump , from a moving truck on the highway.
And probably the most important is you have to work on your mental skills , mental preparation.
And I want to set a new record , with the longest distance ever flown.
June Cohen : I have some questions.
Ueli Gegenschatz : Pretty much . I believe this is probably the closest possibility to come to the dream of being able to fly.
JC : Yet . But people are trying . Are you among those -- you ' re not going to commit -- are you among those trying to do it ? 
JC : All right . Well we will watch this space . But I have two more questions.
UE : Hopefully not.
JC : Ah , I see . So the wingsuit is set up to deliberately release smoke so that you can be tracked . One more question.
UE : The purest and the best feeling would be with only goggles.
JC : Right . Now is there anything you don ' t do ? 
UE : Thank you very much.

I would consider the studio more like a laboratory.
Life in Space is really not necessarily about how we do things , but why we do things.
When the circle goes away you will have another color , the complementary color.
I don ' t necessarily think the film is so interesting.
I think there is a socializing dimension in , kind of , moving that border.
It was about a space in which I put half a semi-circular yellow disk.
So here I had the hope that by inserting some natural elements , if you want -- some fog -- I could make the space tangible.
But look at her face there , as she ' s checking out , looking at herself in the mirror.
How do we reconfigure it ? 
 " What does it matter ?  " 
I would say yes . It is obviously about not just about decorating the world , and making it look even better , or even worse , if you ask me.
The  " Green river, "  as a kind of activist idea , not a part of an exhibition , it was really about showing people , in this city , as they walk by , that space has dimensions . A space has time.
It makes a difference whether you say ,  " I ' m a part of this city.
The idea that art can actually evaluate the relationship between what it means to be in a picture , and what it means to be in a space . What is the difference ? 
These kinds of experiments , they filter into architectural models.
A crystalline stackable principle in the center on the top , which I am trying to turn into a concert hall in Iceland.
This summer , in New York : there is one thing about falling water which is very much about the time it takes for water to fall.
If you stand still , the landscape doesn ' t necessarily tell you how big it is.
The small mountains in the foreground , they move more.
And you go ,  " My god it ' s really far away and it ' s a giant waterfall. " 
Of course being an iconic city like New York , that has had an interest in somehow playing around with the sense of space , you could say that New York wants to seem as big as possible.
And why would we want to do that ? 
So if I have a sense of the space , if I feel that the space is tangible , if I feel there is time , if there is a dimension I could call time , I also feel that I can change the space.
How do we create public space ? 
Of course the political agendas in the world has been very obsessed , polarizing the two against each other into different , very normative ideas.
So what is between thinking and doing ? 
Having an experience is taking part in the world.
http://www.ted.com/talks/edith_widder_how_we_found_the_giant_squid.html
Edith Widder : How we found the giant squid
Nevertheless , there are giants in the ocean , and we now have video proof , as those of you that saw the Discovery Channel documentary are no doubt aware.
I owe my participation in this now-historic event to TED.
It was Mike that got me invited to the squid summit , a gathering of squid experts at the Discovery Channel that summer during Shark Week.
But I also felt like I saw more animals working with the Tiburon than the Ventana , two vehicles with the same field of view but different propulsion systems.
The Tiburon also uses electric powered thrusters.
So for the deep sea squid hunt , I proposed using an optical lure attached to a camera platform with no thrusters , no motors , just a battery-powered camera , and the only illumination coming from red light that ' s invisible to most deep-sea animals that are adapted to see primarily blue.
The reason that the electronic jellyfish worked as a lure is not because giant squid eat jellyfish , but it ' s because this jellyfish only resorts to producing this light when it ' s being chewed on by a predator and its only hope for escape may be to attract the attention of a larger predator that will attack its attacker and thereby afford it an opportunity for escape.
Edith Widder  : Oh my God . Oh my God! Are you kidding me ?  Other scientists : Oh ho ho! That ' s just hanging there.
What really wowed me about that was the way it came in up over the e-jelly and then attacked the enormous thing next to it , which I think it mistook for the predator on the e-jelly.
And then he got so excited , he turned on his flashlight because he wanted to see better , and the giant didn ' t run away , so he risked turning on the white lights on the submersible , bringing a creature of legend from the misty history into high-resolution video.
There are great discoveries yet to be made down there , fantastic creatures representing millions of years of evolution and possibly bioactive compounds that could benefit us in ways that we can ' t even yet imagine.
Exploration is the engine that drives innovation.
We miss him.

Bjarke Ingels : 3 warp-speed architecture tales
And we discovered that we didn ' t have to invent it , it already existed in the form of a comic book.
In this case it ' s Mies van der Rohe ' s Less is More.
Recently , Obama has introduced optimism at a sort of time of global financial crisis.
Rather than revolution , we ' re much more interested in evolution , this idea that things gradually evolve by adapting and improvising to the changes of the world.
At each meeting , there ' s way too many ideas.
And through these sort of generations of design meetings we arrive at a design.
As you can see , sometimes a subspecies branches off.
So as a result , we never throw anything out.
The first story starts last year when we went to Shanghai to do the competition for the Danish National Pavilion for the World Expo in 2010.
When we submitted it for the Swedish competition we thought it was a really cool scheme , but it didn ' t exactly look like something from the north of Sweden.
And at the same time , we got invited to exhibit at the Shanghai Creative Industry Week.
This is our two interpreters , sort of reading the architecture.
And with the People ' s Building , he saw an architecture that could bridge the gap between the ancient wisdom of China and the progressive future of China.
And they chose this mascot because the theme of the expo is  " Better City , Better Life. " 
You ' re not supposed to fly on holidays because it ' s bad for the environment.
You know , it ' s one of the biggest countries in the world , one of the smallest.
So that means that all 1.3 billion Chinese have grown up with  " The Emperor ' s New Clothes, "   " The Matchstick Girl "  and  " The Little Mermaid. " 
The big tourist attraction in Denmark is The Little Mermaid.
But then we looked at recent urban development , and we noticed that this is like a Shanghai street , 30 years ago . All bikes , no cars.
A third of all the people commute by bike.
So if you come to the expo , go straight to the Danish pavilion , get a Danish bike , and then continue on that to visit the other pavilions.
So just like with a bike , we don ' t talk about it.
But in fact , the container ships go full of goods from China to Denmark , and then they sail empty back.
So the real Mermaid , the real water , and the real bikes.
You ' ll walk around , start looking for a bicycle on the roof , jump on your ride and then continue out into the rest of the expo.
It ' s a very serious political issue in China . We will add on.
So for the first time , I got invited to speak at the National Parliament.
But to conclude , if you want to see the Mermaid from May to December next year , don ' t come to Copenhagen , because she ' s going to be in Shanghai.
This is my apartment.
Trying to zigzag it to make sure that all of the apartments look at the straight views , instead of into each other.
And because Copenhagen is completely flat , if you want to have a nice south-facing slope with a view , you basically have to do it yourself.
This is our first architectural model.
It ' s actually a stand-up product from Switzerland , because in Switzerland they have a natural need for diagonal elevators.
So if you go back into the parking , into the corridors , it ' s almost like traveling into a parallel universe from cars and colors , into this sort of south-facing urban oasis.
And there is an automatic irrigation system that makes sure that this sort of landscape of gardens , in one or two years it will sort of transform into a Cambodian temple ruin , completely covered in green.
As an architect , it ' s really hard to set the agenda.
This was the director of the bank when he was still smiling.
We took him to see the Mountain . And he got very excited by this idea that you could actually make mountains out of architecture , because Azerbaijan is known as the Alps of Central Asia.
We quite often make little movies.
Then we place these mountains on the island , surrounding this sort of central green valley , almost like a central park.
And all the sort of excess freshwater wastewater is filtered organically into the landscape , gradually transforming the desert island into sort of a green , lush landscape.
They accumulate the solar energy.
And this summer we are starting the construction documents of the two first mountains , in what ' s going to be the first carbon-neutral island in Central Asia.

Bjorn Lomborg sets global priorities
And I must say , before I go on , I should ask every one of you to try and get out pen and paper because I ' m actually going to ask you to help me to look at how we do that.
There are 800 million people starving.
The lists go on and on.
We don ' t actually solve all problems.
We identified 10 of the biggest challenges in the world , and I will just briefly read them : climate change , communicable diseases , conflicts , education , financial instability , governance and corruption , malnutrition and hunger , population migration , sanitation and water , and subsidies and trade barriers.
But that ' s a wrong problem to ask.
Surely the biggest problem we have in the world is that we all die.
To climate change that would be like Kyoto.
And also -- and that ' s , of course , where economics gets evil -- to put down what are the things we should not do , first.
I ' d love to go into , and get you to think about this process , and that ' s actually what we did.
Nobody wants to do this.
We ' ve had the U.N . for almost 60 years , yet we ' ve never actually made a fundamental list of all the big things that we can do in the world , and said , which of them should we do first ? 
We have not had an idea.
It could be a family-size pizza ; it could be a very individual-size pizza , right ? 
We got 30 of the world ' s best economists , three in each area.
Three of the world ' s top experts saying , what can we do ? 
Then we had some of the world ' s top economists , eight of the world ' s top economists , including three Nobel Laureates , meet in Copenhagen in May 2004.
And what they basically did was come out with a prioritized list.
If you want to know about climate , you ask a climatologist.
They make that in some ways disgusting task of saying , which one should we do first , and which one should we do afterwards ? 
Then there ' s fair projects , good projects and very good projects.
As you might see the bottom of the list was climate change.
And I ' ll actually also try to get back to this because it ' s probably one of the things that we ' ll disagree with on the list that you wrote down.
But it ' s saying that what we can do about it is very little , at a very high cost.
Yet it would do very little good.
So the idea here really is to say , well , we ' ve spent a lot of money doing a little good.
Or half the amount on doing an amazing amount of good ? 
The fair projects -- notice I ' m not going to comment on all these -- but communicable diseases , scale of basic health services -- just made it , simply because , yes , scale of basic health services is a great thing.
Again , sanitation and water is incredibly important , but it also costs a lot of infrastructure.
It might even cost up towards a percentage point of GDP every year for affected nations.
This third best one was free trade.
The second best thing would be to focus on malnutrition.
That would be the second best investment that we could do.
One is treatment ; the other one is prevention.
So basically , what this focuses on is saying , we can do a lot more by investing in prevention.
I ' d like to have you look at your priority list and say , did you get it right ? 
We should also do climate change , if for no other reason , simply because it ' s such a big problem.
The ones where we can do a lot of good rather than a little good.
estimate that the average person in the developing world in 2100 will be about as rich as we are today.
We ' re actually talking about a fairly rich Dutch guy.
So I think that really does tell us why it is we need to get our priorities straight.
It ' s a good film in the sense that I certainly want to see it , right , but don ' t expect Emmerich to cast Brad Pitt in his next movie digging latrines in Tanzania or something.
It ' s not about making things that have the most media attention , but it ' s about making places where we can actually do the most good.
In 1970 , the developed world decided we were going to spend twice as much as we did , right now , than in 1970 , on the developing world.
You know , we spend 100 billion dollars -- why don ' t we spend that on doing good in the world ? 
So the real issue here is to get ourselves back and think about what are the right priorities.
So we actually invited 80 young people from all over the world to come and solve the same problem.
And the surprising thing was that the list was very similar -- with malnutrition and diseases at the top and climate change at the bottom.
And that gives me great hope , really , in saying that I do believe that there is a path ahead to get us to start thinking about priorities , and saying , what is the important thing in the world ? 
We did it in 2004 , and we hope to assemble many more people , getting much better information for 2008 , 2012.
If we worry too much about some things , we end by not worrying about other things.
arts,design,film,happiness
Then this January , my mother died , and pursuing a film like that just seemed the last thing that was interesting to me.
It was a little bit too funky , and we wanted a more feminine point of view and employed a duck who did it in a much more fitting way -- fashion.
The serif is not really in place.
And it turns out that men and women report very , very similar levels of happiness.
If you make more than 50,000 bucks a year in the U.S. , any salary increase you ' re going to experience will have only a tiny , tiny influence on your overall well-being.
You will adapt to it and get used to it.
As well as being married -- you are likely to be much happier than if you are single.
If I look at my own life , I ' m born in 1962 in Austria.
We become what we really are interested in.
And if you look at a guy called Dennis , when he decides what to become -- is it a lawyer , or does he want to become a doctor or a teacher ?  -- best chance is that he wants to become a dentist.
They get influenced by things that they ' re not aware of.
I ' ll figure something out.
This is a project we ' re working on right now with a very healthy deadline.
Quite consciously , design projects that need an incredible amount of various techniques , just basically to fight straightforward adaptation.
Working on projects that actually have visible impacts , like a book for a deceased German artist whose widow came to us with the requirement to make her late husband famous.
So in this case , it ' s an outside projection for Singapore on these giant Times Square-like screens.
But also because the content was very close.

Suzanne Lee : Grow your own clothes
Over time , these tiny threads form in the liquid into layers and produce a mat on the surface.
We need to check that the temperature has cooled to below 30 degrees C.
We need to maintain an optimum temperature for the growth.
After about three days , the bubbles will appear on the surface of the liquid.
And they ' re sticking together , forming layers and giving us a sheet on the surface.
You don ' t have to do anything to it ; you just literally watch it grow.
It ' s over 90 percent water , so we need to let that evaporate.
And then you can either cut that out and sew it conventionally , or you can use the wet material to form it around a three-dimensional shape.
Since it ' s organic , I ' m really keen to try and minimize the addition of any chemicals.
And in fact , cotton would take up to 18 dips in indigo to achieve a color this dark.
The dress would get really heavy , and eventually the seams would probably fall apart -- leaving me feeling rather naked.
Align it in this direction.
But with synthetic biology , we can actually imagine engineering this bacterium to produce something that gives us the quality , quantity and shape of material that we desire.
There ' s no waste.
But I do think it could be quite a smart and sustainable addition to our increasingly precious natural resources.
Bruno Giussani : Suzanne , just a curiosity , what you ' re wearing is not random.
It ' s absorbing my sweat , and it ' s feeding on it.
In the ongoing debate about globalization , what ' s been missing is the voices of workers -- the millions of people who migrate to factories in China and other emerging countries to make goods sold all over the world . Reporter Leslie T . Chang sought out women who work in one of China ' s booming megacities , and tells their stories.
Hi . So I ' d like to talk a little bit about the people who make the things we use every day : our shoes , our handbags , our computers and cell phones.
After all , what ' s wrong with a world in which a worker on an iPhone assembly line can ' t even afford to buy one ? 
In fact , China makes goods for markets all over the world , including its own , thanks to a combination of factors : its low costs , its large and educated workforce , and a flexible manufacturing system that responds quickly to market demands.
In the ongoing debate about globalization , what ' s been missing is the voices of the workers themselves.
I told them that I studied and worked hard . If you tell them more , they won ' t understand anyway. " 
All of these speakers , by the way , are young women , 18 or 19 years old.
Everyone they knew lived in similar circumstances , and it was still better than the dormitories and homes of rural China.
She couldn ' t even tell me what she did on the factory floor.
But like so many theories that Marx arrived at sitting in the reading room of the British Museum , he got this one wrong.
Journalistic coverage of Chinese factories , on the other hand , plays up this relationship between the workers and the products they make.
For example , I recently wrote an article in The New Yorker magazine , but I can ' t afford to buy an ad in it.
How much money can I save ? 
On the train home , she gave me a present : a Coach brand change purse with brown leather trim.
Min ' s sister said to her parents ,  " In America , this bag sells for 320 dollars. " 
Min ' s sister ' s boyfriend , who had traveled home with her for the new year , said ,  " It doesn ' t look like it ' s worth that much. " 
Once , when Min ' s older sister ' s friend got married , she brought a handbag along as a wedding present.
Six skilled leatherworkers crafted 12 Signature handbags with perfect proportions and a timeless flair.
And yet , his view of the world persists , and our tendency to see the workers as faceless masses , to imagine that we can know what they ' re really thinking.
She recently returned to Dongguan on her own to take a job in a factory that makes construction cranes , temporarily leaving her husband and children back in the village.
Very few of them would want to go back to the way things used to be.
By opening up their lives to me , they taught me so much about factories and about China and about how to live in the world.
Chris Anderson : Thank you , Leslie , that was an insight that a lot of us haven ' t had before.
LC : You know , what really impressed me about the workers is how much they ' re self-motivated , self-driven , resourceful , and the thing that struck me , what they want most is education , to learn , because most of them come from very poor backgrounds.
When you talk to workers , that ' s what they want.
CA : Was there a sense from them of a narrative that things were kind of tough and bad , or was there a narrative of some kind of level of growth , that things over time were getting better ? 
Certainly , the factory conditions are really tough , and it ' s nothing you or I would want to do , but from their perspective , where they ' re coming from is much worse , and where they ' re going is hopefully much better , and I just wanted to give that context of what ' s going on in their minds , not what necessarily is going on in yours.

This region seen here for the first time in the Cassini image taken in 2005 . This is the south polar region , with the famous tiger-stripe fractures crossing the south pole.
However , the implications of those results -- of a possible environment within this moon that could support prebiotic chemistry , and perhaps life itself -- were so exciting that , in the intervening two years , we have focused more on Enceladus.
And the tiny water crystals here now look for all the world like they are frozen droplets of salty water , which is a discovery that suggests that not only do the jets come from pockets of liquid water , but that that liquid water is in contact with rock.
Whether or not there are living organisms there , of course , is an entirely different matter.
Filmmaker Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy takes on a terrifying question : How does the Taliban convince children to become suicide bombers ?  Propaganda footage from a training camp is intercut with her interviews of young camp graduates . A shocking vision.
Today , I want you to look at children who become suicide bombers through a completely different lens.
The Taliban now run their own schools.
Young boys are taught justifications for suicide attacks and the execution of spies.
How do the Taliban in your area get people to join them ? 
HA : They teach us to use machine guns , Kalashnikov , rocket launchers , grenades , bombs.
HA : If God gives me strength.
Then they ship them off , hundreds of miles away to hard-line schools that run along the Taliban agenda.
If any child is found violating these rules , he is severely reprimanded.
The children are virtual prisoners ; they cannot leave , they cannot go home.
Effectively , this is the brainwashing process that has begun.
That ' s why Pakistani civilians , over 6,000 of whom have been killed in the last two years alone , are fair game.
This boy is called Zenola.
This boy is called Messoud.

Boy : On the day of judgment , God will ask me ,  " Why did you do that ?  "

2012 may be the year of 3D printing , when this three-decade-old technology finally becomes accessible and even commonplace . Lisa Harouni gives a useful introduction to this fascinating way of making things -- including intricate objects once impossible to create.
It is actually a reality today that you can download products from the Web -- product data , I should say , from the Web -- perhaps tweak it and personalize it to your own preference or your own taste , and have that information sent to a desktop machine that will fabricate it for you on the spot.
They have been around for almost 30 years now , which is quite amazing to think of , but they ' re only just starting to filter into the public arena.
But if these machines have been around for almost 30 years , why don ' t we know about them ? 
That means that you guys will soon be able to access one of these machines , if not this minute.
And here you can see an engineer -- it could be an architect or it could be a professional product designer -- create a product in 3D.
And the bonding process can happen by either melting and depositing or depositing then melting.
And this is quite an extraordinary idea , but it is reality today.
But what you ' ll notice about all of these products is they ' re very , very intricate.
So in some cases , we can abolish totally the need for manual labor.
This is almost three meters high.
And on the other end of the spectrum , this is a microstructure.
So who ' s using it ? 
So you can now create one-offs very easily.
And very hard to even create this by hand.
Now 3D printing can break away barriers in design which challenge the constraints of mass production.
And it ' s used by aerospace and automotive.
Typically an implant is more effective within the body if it ' s more porous , because our body tissue will grow into it.
And in fact , because we can create bespoke products en masse , one-offs , we can create implants that are specific to individuals.
They ' re also now small enough to sit on a desktop.
If I gave you a 3D printer , you wouldn ' t know how to direct it to make what you want it to.
So today , you can download products from the Web -- anything you would have on your desktop , like pens , whistles , lemon squeezers.
Can you imagine going online -- this is a reality -- and finding that spare part from a database of geometries of that discontinued product and downloading that information , that data , and having the product made for you at home , ready to use , on your demand ? 
But what interests my company the most is the fact that you can create individual unique products en masse.
This is something that is now possible today , that you can direct personally how you want your products to look.
In fact , every major household name is allowing you to interact with their products on a daily basis -- all the way from Smart Cars to Prada to Ray Ban , for example.
Imagine that you can now engage with a brand and interact , so that you can pass your personal attributes to the products that you ' re about to buy.
And you can start iterating the design.
The piece of software will keep an individual within the bounds of the possible.
What ' s more likely , and we ' re seeing it today , is that data gets sent to a local manufacturing center.
You can see , this came out of the machine in one piece and the electronics were inserted later.
So we can run this through to something like prosthetics , which is highly specialized to an individual ' s handicap.
And the idea of now creating implants , scanning data , an MRI scan of somebody can now be converted into 3D data and we can create very specific implants for them.
You couldn ' t really create this or simulate it in any other way.
Now this is not something that ' s ready for the public , but it is in working progress.
We ' re all different sizes and our companies the same.
Jacqueline Novogratz tells a moving story of an encounter in a Nairobi slum with Jane , a former prostitute , whose dreams of escaping poverty , of becoming a doctor and of getting married were fulfilled in an unexpected way.
I ' ve been working on issues of poverty for more than 20 years , and so it ' s ironic that the problem that and question that I most grapple with is how you actually define poverty . What does it mean ? 
And I had an experience that really deepened and elucidated for me the understanding that I have.
It ' s about three miles out of Nairobi , and it ' s a mile long and about two-tenths of a mile wide , where over half a million people live crammed in these little tin shacks , generation after generation , renting them , often eight or 10 people to a room.
I met this woman , Mama Rose , who has rented that little tin shack for 32 years , where she lives with her seven children.
And I would see kids on the street corners , and they ' d say  " Obama , he ' s our brother! " 
I was struck immediately by the kindness and the gentleness in her face , and I asked her to tell me her story.
She got married when she was 18 , had a baby right away.
It wasn ' t organized in the way we often think of it.
She had a girlfriend who had heard about this organization , Jamii Bora , that would lend money to people no matter how poor you were , as long as you provided a commensurate amount in savings.
Some of them might be ones you gave.
And by many definitions she is no longer poor.
Jamii Bora understands that and understands that when we ' re talking about poverty , we ' ve got to look at people all along the economic spectrum.
And then they match her mortgage to what she paid in rent for her little shanty.
And she said ,  " What would I miss ? 
And she said ,  " Well , you know , my dreams don ' t look exactly like I thought they would when I was a little girl.
And I say ,  ' Look at me . You are not dead.
Because when systems are broken , like the ones that we ' re seeing around the world , it ' s an opportunity for invention and for innovation.
And just as important , we owe it to ourselves.

Think about something you ' ve always wanted to add to your life and try it for the next 30 days.
This was part of a challenge I did to take a picture every day for a month.
Even last year , I ended up hiking up Mt . Kilimanjaro , the highest mountain in Africa.
Every November , tens of thousands of people try to write their own 50,000-word novel from scratch in 30 days.
You might be sleep-deprived , but you ' ll finish your novel.
But for the rest of my life , if I meet John Hodgman at a TED party , I don ' t have to say ,  " I ' m a computer scientist. " 
There ' s nothing wrong with big , crazy challenges.
So here ' s my question to you : What are you waiting for ? 
energy,invention,technology
My family had moved from Fort Lee , New Jersey to California , and we moved from the snow to lots of heat , and gas lines.
I had just taken trigonometry in high school , I learned about the parabola and how it could concentrate rays of light to a single focus.
And this was a company where I built parabolas , I took metal shop , and I remember walking into metal shop building parabolas and Stirling engines.
I sold the plans for this engine and for this dish in the back of Popular Science magazine , for four dollars each.
But then , in the second year of Caltech , they started grading.
First , the coursework at Caltech.
I started an educational software company after I joined Lotus , and then I started Idealab so I could have a roof under which I could build multiple companies in succession Then , much much later -- in 2000 , very recently -- the new California energy crisis -- or what was purported to be a big energy crisis -- was coming.
So much more energy can be stored with fuel than with batteries.
Maybe we could make energy.
And it really needed to get much lower than that to be cost effective.
Hopefully , if we can reduce the amount of energy it takes to make the cells , that will become more practical.
So I thought of an idea -- what if we collect the sun with a large reflector -- like I had been thinking about way back when , when I was in high school -- but maybe with modern technology we could make a cheaper , large collector , concentrate it to a small converter , and then the conversion device wouldn ' t have to be as expensive , because it ' s much smaller , rather than solar cells , which have to be covering the entire surface area that you want to gather sun from.
Of course , inexpensive microprocessors and then a very important breakthrough -- genetic algorithms.
Usually , with a genetic algorithm on a computer today , with a three gigahertz processor you can solve many , many formerly intractable problems in just a matter of minutes.
Those shapes are parabolas.
So we tried to come up with a way of making a non-tracking collector , a collector that would gather much more than one degree of light , with no moving parts.
So for direct light , it takes only one bounce , for off-axis light it might take two , and for extreme off-axis , it might take three.
On an average adjusted day , a solar cell -- because the sun ' s moving across the sky , the solar cell is going down with a sine wave function of performance at the off-axis angles.
So we took a look at another idea.
And you can buy stepper motors that pretty much never wear out because they have no brushes , for a dollar.
So we tried to look at all the different heat engines that have been used in history to try and convert sunlight to electricity , or heat to electricity.
He added new linear motion guides to the pistons , he added a condenser to cool the steam outside the cylinder , he made the engine double-acting so it had double the power.
Steam engines are dangerous , and they had tremendous impact on the world , as you know -- industrial revolution and ships and locomotives.
And the hot air engine also was not invented by Robert Stirling , but Robert Stirling came along in 1816 and radically improved it.
You could now get a lot more power in a lot smaller space , and that allowed the engine to be used for mobile applications.
And not nearly as many small steam engines being built anymore , only large ones for big operations.
But if you ' re trying to generate solar energy in a static place the weight doesn ' t matter so much.
So you don ' t want to optimize for efficiency , you want to optimize for power per dollar.
And that ' s the process we took -- let me show you how the engine works.
That ' s a heat engine.
So someone came up with a very clever idea , to -- instead of heating the whole cylinder and cooling the whole cylinder , what about if you put a displacer inside -- a little thing that shuttles the air back and forth.
And then Robert Stirling came along with this genius idea , which was , well I ' m still not heating the metal now , with this kind of engine , but I ' m still reheating all the air.
So when the air pushes up to go from the hot end to the cold end , it puts some heat into the sponge.
We built a huge mathematical model of how a Stirling engine works.
We measured each one , we readjusted the model to what we measured , and then we led that to the current prototype.
It ' s just a small cylinder down here which holds the generator inside and all the linkage and it ' s the hot cap -- the hot cylinder on the top -- this part gets hot , this part is cool , and electricity comes out.
So now you put the two things together.
This is being run out in the sun , and now I want to show you what the actual thing looks like.
Each petal adjusts itself separately to keep the highest temperature on it.
What it does is it searches to find the hottest spot , it searches again a half an hour later , it searches again a day later , it searches again a month later.
We have an inverter in there , so you get 117 volts A.C.
But you can use it to optionally heat hot water and that brings the efficiency up even higher because some of the heat that you would normally be rejecting , you can now use as useful energy , whether it ' s for a pool or hot water.
Once they get a temperature reading on the thermocouple indicating they found the sun , then they slow down and do a fine search , then all the petals will move into position , and then the engine will start.
It could be on your roof , or in your backyard , or somewhere else.
This is how we would envision a residential application.
So an example of that is , here ' s the map of the United States.
It just affects the payback period if you ' re comparing to grid-supplied electricity.
This is the map of the whole Earth and again , you can see a huge swathe in the middle of pretty much where a large part of the population is , there ' s tremendous chances for solar energy.
We believe we ' re getting very close to something practical and affordable.
Right now , solar paybacks are between 30 and 50 years.
I was walking from the elevator over here , and even just looking at the stage right now -- so there ' s probably 20 500 watt lights right now.
And it ' s just amazing , walk in the elevator and there ' s lights on in the elevator.
Basically , oil is solar energy concentrate.
Thank you very much , you ' ve been a great audience.

I ' m trying to figure out two very simple things : how to live and how to die , period.
My older sister was busy torturing my parents , and they were busy torturing her.
And I was writing terrible poetry and knitting sweaters for him.
And that was a good thing to help , you know , the cause.
And so what happened was that I started just becoming an editorial illustrator through , you know , sheer whatever , sheer ignorance.
So , the premise in the studio was , there are no boundaries , there is no fear.
And some of the watches there , attempting to be beautiful and humorous -- maybe not attempting , hopefully succeeding.
So , the good news is that I have a dog and , though I don ' t know if I believe in luck -- I don ' t know what I believe in , it ' s a very complicated question , but I do know that before I go away , I crank his tail seven times.
But I have been taking beautiful notes of drawings and I have a gorgeous onion from Murray Gell-Mann ' s talk.
So , in writing for children , it seems simple , and it is.
So , I hopefully am writing , you know , books that are good for children and for adults.
This is Andrew Gatz , and he walked in through the door and I said ,  " You! Sit down there. "  You know , I take lots of photos.
And the books are really journals of my life.
But anyway , so we were in Venice , and this is our room . And I had this dream that I was wearing this fantastic green gown , and I was looking out the window , and it was really a beautiful thing.
Well , he has some hair but -- well , he used to have hair.
We weren ' t trying to be funny , we weren ' t trying to be -- well , we were trying to be funny actually , that ' s not true.
Who are these people ?  What are these tribes ? 
So it stayed in , and it was , and , you know , it was a good thing.
But I picked it up and I started reading it and I thought , this book is amazing.
And they said yes , and they left me completely alone , which was a gorgeous , wonderful thing.
And when you ' re dealing with grammar , which is , you know , incredibly dry , E.B . White wrote such wonderful , whimsical -- and actually , Strunk -- and then you come to the rules and , you know , Do you mind my asking a question ?  " 
So , there ' s a kind of British understatement , murder-mystery theme that I really love very much.
So , I commissioned a wonderful composer , Nico Muhly , who wrote nine songs using the text , and we performed this fantastic evening of -- he wrote music for both amateurs and professionals.
I ' m going to read quickly -- and probably I ' m going to edit some , because I don ' t have that much time left -- a few of the columns.
And they said ,  " It ' s unlimited , it ' s unlimited. " 
And I talk about the dodo , and how the dodo became extinct , and then I talk about Spinoza.
And then he died , and there was no more Spinoza . Extinct.
Maybe amongst themselves they had a few good laughs , but Stalin was a paranoid man , even more than my father. " 
And so , this is a chart of , you know , just a small chart , because the chart would go on forever of all the people that he killed.
So ,  " My beautiful mother ' s family fled Russia as well.
Facts were actually banished from our home.
But then she says Tel Aviv and Lenin , which is the town they came from , and ,  " Sorry , the rest unknown , thank you. " 
I received a box in the mail and it was wrapped with newspaper and there was the picture of the man on the newspaper and he was dead.
There ' s consoling.
And I really spend a lot of time wondering , how much truth do we tell ? 
Or are they fake sentences that we think we ought to be saying ? 
A complicated question.
I taped my aunt . I taped my aunt singing a song in Russian from the -- you know , could we have it for a second ? 
I went to visit Kitty Carlisle Hart , and she is 96 , and when I brought her a copy of  " The Elements of Style, "  she said she would treasure it.
And she dated George Gershwin , so , you know , get out.
I do want to talk -- the absolute icing on this cemetery cake is the Barricini family mausoleum nearby.
And then I photograph and do a painting of a sofa on the street.
And I wonder what the point is and then I know , and I see that Hy Meyerowitz , Rick Meyerowitz ' s father , a dry-cleaning supply salesman from the Bronx , won the Charlie Chaplin look-alike contest in 1931.
It means  " I have enough. "  And that is utterly true.
chemistry,climate change,environment,global issues,science
Headlines that look like this when they have to do with climate change , and headlines that look like this when they have to do with air quality or smog.
They wrote almost a thousand pages on the topic.
And every one of those scientists is in a research group , and every research group studies a wide variety of topics.
The weight of a paper clip is approximately equal to 900 zeta-illion -- 10 to the 21st -- molecules of isoprene.
Because it ' s important to the atmospheric system , we go to all lengths to study this thing.
But still , we look at the pieces.
And we perform dozens of integrations in order to understand what ' s happening.
This is the tower in the middle of the rainforest , from above.
So maybe you took a similar aircraft to get here today.
We have to get special flight clearance.
It ' s a flying laboratory that we took to make measurements in the region of this molecule.
And as a body of knowledge builds up , it will form one subsection , or one sub-subsection of an assessment like the IPCC , although we have others.
And we hand that summary to journalists and policy makers , in order to make headlines like these.
165
Very soon they ' ll be doing everything for us.
So I want to give a little bit of a different perspective of how we can perhaps look at these things in a little bit of a different way.
So let ' s try to look at it from a different perspective.
Put them all together , and put all this under kind of natural selection , under mutation , and rewarded things for how well they can move forward.
Here ' s a physical robot that we actually have a population of brains , competing , or evolving on the machine.
But I want to show you a different approach , and this is this robot over here , which has four legs.
You look at it and you see it has four legs , the machine doesn ' t know if it ' s a snake , if it ' s a tree , it doesn ' t have any idea what it looks like , but it ' s going to try to find that out.
So what you ' re seeing here are a couple of machines -- a pattern of locomotion.
So , we ' ll move forward to a different idea.
So we have these cubes , like the diagram showed here.
They begin to self-replicate . So in absence of any reward , the intrinsic reward is self-replication.
So of course , this is a very crude machine , but we ' re working on a micro-scale version of these , and hopefully the cubes will be like a powder that you pour in.
His Holiness the Karmapa talks about how he was discovered to be the reincarnation of a revered figure in Tibetan Buddhism . In telling his story , he urges us to work on not just technology and design , but the technology and design of the heart . He is translated onstage by Tyler Dewar.
Tyler Dewar : The way I feel right now is that all of the other speakers have said exactly what I wanted to say.
All of the plans for me were already made.
They were looking the next Karmapa , and I noticed they were talking to my mom and dad , and the news came to me that they were telling me that I was the Karmapa.
I thought that things would be pretty fun and there would be more things to play with.
I was separated , largely , from my family , including my mother and father.
TD : Nevertheless , I felt that , even though I ' ve been separated from my loved ones -- and , of course , now I ' m even further away.
TD : And I still do get to keep in touch with my mother and father , albeit infrequently.
And in terms of other things that I wanted to share with you , in terms of ideas , I think it ' s wonderful to have a situation like this , where so many people from different backgrounds and places can come together , exchange their ideas and form relationships of friendship with each other.
So we spoke and we heard some about design this week.
I feel that there are some things that are getting in the way.
TD : So we ended up talking about the Bamiyan Buddhas , which , as you know , were destroyed some years ago in Afghanistan.
What we saw in the destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas was the depletion of matter , some solid substance falling down and disintegrating.
TD : Of course , I rejoice in the development and the growth and the rise of the noble land of India , the great country of India , but at the same time , I think , as some of us have acknowledged , we need to be aware that some aspects of this rise are coming at the cost of the very ground on which we stand.
We have that information , but what often happens to us is that we don ' t really choose to pay attention to it.
Whatever work you ' re trying to do now to benefit the world , sink into that , get a full taste of that.
His Holiness the Karmapa : Tomorrow is my Talk.
And so Lakshmi had to put up with me through all of that , but I very much appreciate the opportunity she ' s given me to be here.
In 2007 , as the world worried about a possible avian flu epidemic , Laurie Garrett , author of  " The Coming Plague, "  gave this powerful talk to a small TED University audience . Her insights from past pandemics are suddenly more relevant than ever.
So the first question is , why do we need to even worry about a pandemic threat ? 
While globalization has increased travel , it ' s made it necessary that everybody be everywhere , all the time , all over the world.
Indeed , an outbreak would be multiple Katrinas at once.
In the bird outbreaks we now can see that pretty much the whole world has seen this virus except the Americas.
And we ' ve dealt with it by killing off lots and lots and lots of chickens , and unfortunately often not reimbursing the peasant farmers with the result that there ' s cover-up.
So that birds going to Siberia , to Europe , and to Africa carried the virus , which had not previously been possible.
It ' s not going to do us very much good in a global pandemic.
So the thought is , hey , maybe what we should do is just immediately -- we hear there is H5N1 spreading from human to human , the virus has mutated to be a human-to-human transmitter -- let ' s shut down the airports.
How do you get them mobilized around the world if you ' ve shut all the airports down ? 
We ' ve seen transmission to wild cats and domestic cats , and now also domestic pet dogs.
We had evolution over time , and this unbelievable mortality rate in human beings : 55 percent of people who have become infected with H5N1 have , in fact , succumbed.
The result : most of the deaths have been in people under 30 years of age , robustly healthy young adults.
And we have spent a lot of money.
Half the states would run out of hospital beds in the first week , maybe two weeks.
Exercises , drills , all over the world.
Most of these people don ' t actually know what their job will be.
In fact , the federal government says it ' s a guy called the Principle Federal Officer , who happens to be with TSA.
Well how good a city council you have , how good a mayor you have -- that ' s who ' s going to be in charge.
Unfortunately it ' s made against the current form of H5N1.
You ' re the mayor of your local town.
These are in Hong Kong ; we have nothing like that here.
And some states have differential policies , county by county.
Well the British government did a model of telecommuting.
Your insurance payments didn ' t go through.
But actually in scientific community there is great debate about what percentage of flu transmission between people is from sneezing and coughing and what percentage is on your hands.
In the SARS epidemic , we learned in Hong Kong that most of transmission was because people were removing their masks improperly.
You ' ll end up buying -- this is called an N95 mask . Ridiculous.
Should you take Tamiflu for a long period of time , well , one of the side effects is suicidal ideations.
And we now have seen Tamiflu-resistant strains in both Vietnam in person-to-person transmission , and in Egypt in person-to-person transmission.
We ' ve stockpiled enough for 30 percent.
What do we know from 1918 , the last great pandemic ? 
And the rules and the belief systems were wildly disparate.
And in the first wave we had enough healthcare workers.
Most of the death toll was 15 to 40 year-olds -- robustly healthy young adults.
This was based on European and North American data.
So are we ready ? 
What mask works , what mask doesn ' t work.
We don ' t know -- again with Tamiflu , the number one side effect of Tamiflu is flu-like symptoms.
But really ?  Do you really have a place to stockpile 18 months worth of food ?  Twenty-four months worth of food ? 
And right now most of the preparedness is deeply flawed.
But I guess the other thing to add is , if you do have employees , and you do have a company , I think you have certain responsibilities to demonstrate that you are thinking ahead for them , and you are trying to plan.
Well if you have a dot-com , maybe you can.
Laurie Garret : What factors determine the duration of a pandemic , we don ' t really know.
But we don ' t really know how and why that happens.
To say ahh , if this happens then we are going to have a pandemic ? 
Audience member : Some research has indicated that statins can be helpful.
The mechanism isn ' t clear.
Audience member : How far along are we in being able to determine whether someone is actually carrying , whether somebody has this before the symptoms are full-blown ? 
I ' m thinking dipstick.
But we ' re not there . And there hasn ' t been the kind of investment to get us there.
LG : Um yeah . So we don ' t actually know what the lethality was of the 1918 strain to wild birds before it jumped from birds to humans.
And after circulating around the world came back in a form that was tremendously lethal.
But we don ' t really know.
And along comes pneumococcus or another bacteria , streptococcus and boom , they get a bacterial pneumonia.
And I would just add we saw the same thing with SARS.
And it won ' t do any good to bring in the tanks and the artillery because those T-cells don ' t recognize it either.
But it ' s not bacterial pneumonia.
Imagine an electric vehicle that can get you to work -- or anywhere in a six-mile radius -- quickly , without traffic frustrations or gasoline . Now imagine you can pick it up and carry it with you . Yes , this souped-up skateboard could change the face of morning commutes.
Today I ' m going to show you an electric vehicle that weighs less than a bicycle , that you can carry with you anywhere , that you can charge off a normal wall outlet in 15 minutes , and you can run it for 1,000 kilometers on about a dollar of electricity.
I ' ve got some of the pieces in my pocket here.
These are from remote control airplanes.
[6 Mile Range] [Top Speed Near 20mph] [Uphill Climbing] [Regenerative Braking] So we ' re going to show you what this thing can do.
So I ' ll leave you with one of the most compelling facts about this technology and these kinds of vehicles.
http://www.ted.com/talks/philippe_petit_the_journey_across_the_high_wire.html
Philippe Petit : The journey across the high wire
Now my story has a lot to do with dreaming , although I ' m known to make my dreams come true.
Eighteen minutes , clearly impossible.
No , the best way for me to start is to pay my respects to the gods of creativity.
When I was six years old , I fell in love with magic.
Now I ' m not supposed to share that with you , but I have to show you the card is hidden in the back of the hand.
The cards were bigger than my hands.
The magician looked at me and said ,  " This is a disaster.
And I ' m not cheating . It ' s in the back . It ' s perfect.
So that ' s it . I ' m 14 ; I ' m becoming a juggler.
They are those beautiful oblong objects , but quite difficult to make.
Anyway , here I was progressing with my new clubs.
And I was trying constantly to bring them back to me.
So I proudly showed him my clubs.
Tenacity is how I kept at it against all odds.
Now I have been playing with ropes and climbing all my childhood , so that ' s it . I ' m 16 ; I ' m becoming a wire walker.
I get a pair of pliers and some coat hangers , and I gather them together in some kind of ropey path.
Well within a few days I ' m able to do one crossing.
Now you can imagine at that time I had to switch the ridiculous boots for some slippers.
On the high wire , within months , I ' m able to master all the tricks they do in the circus , except I am not satisfied.
Notre Dame , the Sydney Harbor Bridge , the World Trade Center.
All of a sudden the density of the air is no longer the same.
I step over the beam.
On one side , a mass of a mountain , a life I know.
An inner howl assails me , the wild longing to flee.
Faith is what replaces doubt in my dictionary.
In fact , I put my World Trade Center crossing at the same artistic level as some of my smaller walks -- or some completely different type of performance.
So I cannot street juggle here , you understand.
Thank you . Thank you.
Now I have done the impossible not once , but many times.
And I thought it would be incredible if in the middle of the wire I stopped and , like a magician , I produce a dove and send her in the sky as a living symbol of peace.
I mean , a bird needs space to fly.
The mayor of Jerusalem , Teddy Kollek , comes to wish me the best.
So I start the walk . Everything is fine.
And then in the most magnificent gesture , I send the bird of peace into the azure.
But the dove , who obviously didn ' t go to flying school , goes flop , flop , flop and ends up at the end of my balancing pole.
They must think this guy with this dove , he must have spent years working with him.
Now the dove , who , now you know , obviously cannot fly , does for the third time a little flop , flop , flop and ends up on the wire behind me.
And something happened.
For a moment , the entire crowd had forgotten their differences.
So I walk , you clap , everybody in unison.
And whenever he ' s daunted by an impossible situation to solve in this hard-to-manage city , instead of giving up , he looks at the picture and he says ,  " If Philippe can do that , I can do this, "  and he goes back to work.
Please take this music with you home , and start gluing feathers to your arms and take off and fly , and look at the world from a different perspective.
A unique ecosystem of plants , birds and monkeys thrives in the treetops of the rainforest . Nalini Nadkarni explores these canopy worlds -- and shares her findings with the world below , through dance , art and bold partnerships.
Trees are wonderful arenas for discovery because of their tall stature , their complex structure , the biodiversity they foster and their quiet beauty.
I ' d like to take you all on a journey up to the forest canopy , and share with you what canopy researchers are asking and also how they ' re communicating with other people outside of science.
This was filmed in Monteverde , Costa Rica and I think it gives us the best impression of what it ' s like to climb a giant strangler fig.
There are 10,000 species of ants that taxonomists -- people who describe and name animals -- have named.
So we may be the only family that has an ant named after each one of us.
These plants occur in great diversity , over 28,000 species around the world.
And these mosses , generated by decomposing , are like peat moss in your garden.
And so those epiphytes are actually paying the landlord a bit of rent in exchange for being supported high above the forest floor.
What we found , however , was that they took an extremely long time -- over 20 years -- to regenerate , starting from the bottom and growing up.
So , recolonization is really very slow.
We know it ' s a lot , but we do not yet know the answers to how much , and by what processes , carbon is being taken out of the atmosphere , held in its biomass , and moving on through the ecosystem.
I ' ve also looked out on urban places like this and thought about people who are disassociated from trees in their lives.
And especially , you know , as a small brown woman in a little college , in the upper northwest part of our country , far away from the areas of power and money , I really have to ask myself ,  " What can I do about this ? 
And so , that ' s what I ' ve begin doing , and so I ' d like to unveil the International Canopy Network here.
Treetop Barbie is a great example of that.
We ' ve also made partnerships with artists , with people who understand and can communicate the aesthetic beauty of trees and forest canopies.
I ' ll just give you a few examples.
Jodi Lomask , and her wonderful troupe Capacitor , joined me in the canopy in my rainforest site in Costa Rica.
We had wooden flutists , we had oboists , we had opera singers , we had guitar players , and we had rap singers.
I saw the power of Duke ' s song with urban youth -- an audience , you know , I as a middle-aged professor , I don ' t have a hope of getting to -- in terms of convincing them of the importance of wildlands.
They ended up making a CD which they took home to their family and friends , thereby expressing their own experiences with nature in their own medium.
It ' s a 265 million dollar industry and it ' s increasing rapidly.
Well , my thought was that I could learn how to grow mosses , and that way we wouldn ' t have to take them out of the wild.
The best I can imagine.
And they embraced the idea that they could help develop a research design in order to grow these mosses.
We gave talks once a month , and that actually ended up implementing some amazing sustainability projects at the prisons -- organic gardens , worm culture , recycling , water catchment and beekeeping.
And they will have the pleasure , many of them , of seeing those frogs that they ' ve raised from eggs and helped develop , helped nurture , move out into protected wildlands to augment the number of endangered species out there in the wild.
And so I ' m hoping that my husband Jack , the ant taxonomist , can perhaps work with Mattel to make Taxonomist Ken.
Given the duress that we ' re feeling environmentally in these times , it is time for scientists to reach outward , and time for those outside of science to reach towards academia as well.
When we come to understand nature , we are touching the most deep , the most important parts of our self.

Heather Brooke : My battle to expose government corruption
If they went exploring into the parents '  rooms , or even into the secret filing cabinets , they were punished , and told that for their own good they must never go in there again.
There were maps and minutes from meetings where the parents were slagging each other off.
Well , there was a girl in the town , and she didn ' t think they should be in the secret filing cabinets , or if they were , there ought to be a law to allow the children access.
It wasn ' t like I was asking for the code to a nuclear bunker , or anything like that , but the amount of resistance I got from this Freedom of Information request , you would have thought I ' d asked something like this.
And I ' ve got to tell you , I wasn ' t that hopeful , because I ' d seen the establishment . I thought , it always sticks together . I am out of luck.
What they hadn ' t counted on was digitization , because that meant that all those paper receipts had been scanned in electronically , and it was very easy for somebody to just copy that entire database , put it on a disk , and then just saunter outside of Parliament , which they did , and then they shopped that disk to the highest bidder , which was the Daily Telegraph , and then , you all remember , there was weeks and weeks of revelations , everything from porn movies and bath plugs and new kitchens and mortgages that had never been paid off.
It was an example of a culture clash that ' s happening all over the world between bewigged and bestockinged officials who think that they can rule over us without very much prying from the public , and then suddenly confronted with a public who is no longer content with that arrangement , and not only not content with it , now , more often , armed with official data itself.
They want a say in decisions that are made in their name and with their money . It ' s this democratization of information that I think is an information enlightenment , and it has many of the same principles of the first Enlightenment.
Obviously the Church weren ' t very happy about this , and they tried to suppress it , but what they hadn ' t counted on was technology , and then they had the printing press , which suddenly enabled these ideas to spread cheaply , far and fast , and people would come together in coffee houses , discuss the ideas , plot revolution.
And if we ' re thinking about a finance system , we need a lot of information to take in . It ' s just not possible for one person to take in the amount , the volume of information , and analyze it to make good decisions.
And it ' s getting harder to hide assets , tax avoidance , pay inequality . So that ' s great . We ' re starting to find out more and more about these systems.
And how is it possible that the volume of information can be processed that needs to in this system ? 
So this is a guy called Seb Bacon . He ' s a computer programmer , and he built a site called Alaveteli , and what it is , it ' s a Freedom of Information platform.
So there ' s a list there of the different countries that have it , and then there ' s a few more coming on board.
It ' s the Icelandic Modern Media Initiative , and they ' ve just got funding to make it an international modern media project , and this is taking all of the best laws around the world about freedom of expression , protection of whistleblowers , protection from libel , source protection , and trying to make Iceland a publishing haven.
You can try and find out how he ' s moving out assets from that country.
You know , they ' re just not going to get it.
So I can tell you firsthand what it was like to have access to this leak . It was amazing . I mean , it was amazing.
They all bitched about each other . I mean , quite gossipy , those cables . Okay , but I thought it was a very important point for all of us to grasp , these are human beings just like us . They don ' t have special powers.
Because that is what Julian Assange did.
The other thing is that power is incredibly seductive , and you must have two real qualities , I think , when you come to the table , when you ' re dealing with power , talking about power , because of its seductive capacity.
I want to see the evidence behind why that ' s so.
At the moment our rights are incredibly weak.
I would like us to work towards that.
There was no evidence . He presented no evidence of that.
So he was talking about the law in Britain which is the Communications Data Bill , an absolutely outrageous piece of legislation.
Well , to go back to our original story , the parents have panicked . They ' ve locked all the doors.
Some fairy tales have happy endings . Some don ' t.
Thank you.

I was 19 years old at the time.
And to a fish nerd , this is some pretty exciting stuff.
I made a really stupid kind of mistake that most 19-year-old males do when they think they ' re immortal , and I got a bad case of the bends , and was paralyzed , and had to be flown back for treatment.
I had to focus all my energies towards going to find new species of things down on deep coral reefs.
There is a problem with scuba though , in that it imposes some limitations on how deep you can go , and it turns out that depth is about 200 feet.
Now , submersibles are great , wonderful things , but if you ' re going to spend 30,000 dollars a day to use one of these things , and it ' s capable of going 2,000 feet , you ' re sure not going to go farting around up here in a couple of hundred feet , you ' re going to go way , way , way , down deep.
We know almost nothing about it.
We ' re all breathing air right now . Air is a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen , about 20 percent oxygen . About 80 percent nitrogen is in our lungs.
The nitrogen just sort of floats around in our blood and tissues , and that ' s all fine , that ' s how we ' re designed.
And the effect of that pressure is that you have an increased density of gas molecules in every breath you take.
And of course , if you were to down to where there ' s 15 times as much -- the deeper you go , the more exacerbating the problem becomes.
Now , we all know the song :  " Love is like oxygen./ You get too much , you get too high./ Not enough , and you ' re going to die. " 
The nitrogen has two problems.
The deeper you go , the loopier you get.
Now helium ' s a gas , there ' re a lot of reasons why helium ' s good , it ' s a tiny molecule , it ' s inert , it doesn ' t give you narcosis.
So , this is how I began , about 15 years ago.
Over time we got a little bit better at it , and we came up with this really sophisticated-looking rig with four scuba tanks and five regulators and all the right gas mixtures and all that good stuff.
For all its bulk and size , it only gave us about 15 minutes at most down at those sorts of depths.
In 1994 , I was fortunate enough to get access to these prototype closed-circuit rebreathers.
Two , they allow you to stay underwater longer.
There are three basic systems to a closed- circuit rebreather.
Now , the counterlungs aren ' t high-tech , they ' re just simply flexible bags.
And , the other component on a breathing loop is the carbon dioxide absorbent canister.
The second main component of a closed-circuit rebreather is the gas system.
So we need another gas , something to dilute the oxygen with.
But , if we want to go deeper , of course , we need another gas supply.
We also have a second oxygen cylinder , that ' s solely as a back-up in case there ' s a problem with our first oxygen supply we can continue to breathe.
The most critical part of a rebreather is the oxygen sensors.
Any one of those computers can run the entire system , so if you have to lose two of them , there ' s also back-up power supplies.
I ' m going to take you on a deep dive.
So , we drop in the water , and we just sort of go over the edge of this cliff , and then we just start dropping , dropping , dropping.
It ' s really a very interesting -- you ever see  " The Abyss "  where Ed Harris , you know , he ' s sinking down along the side of the wall ? 
But , when you turn on your light , you look around at the caves , and all of a sudden you ' re confronted with a tremendous amount of diversity , much more than anyone used to believe.
It ' s not just fish , either.
But this is what it looks like , and this kind of habitat just goes on and on and on for miles.
And we ' re not quite sure why.
I think we have their attention.
Diver 2 : Uh , silvertip sharks.
And yes , it ' s a little nerve-wracking.
Sharks are actually not very dangerous animals and that ' s why we weren ' t worried much , why we were joking around down there.
Coconuts! You can get killed by a coconut more likely than killed by a shark.
The last article is an article entitled  " No New Frontiers. " 
But , it ' s much more than that.
A couple of these ended up getting sold through the aquarium trade to Japan , where they sold for 15,000 dollars apiece.
We were at 360 feet.
I think that ' s a new species. " 
So that ' s it ' s official scientific name , in reference to its deep-dwelling habits.
If you go to Papua , New Guinea , and go down 300 feet , you ' re going to see these big mounds.
It ' s really extraordinary to find something like this.
We ' re up to seven new species per hour of time we spend at that depth.
So a very large percentage of what is out there isn ' t really known.
This is the second extraordinary photograph I ' m going to show you.
Less than 60 seconds after this picture was taken , this guy was dead.
He had an oxygen toxicity seizure and he drowned.
I call it seeking joy -- this pursuit of happiness.
So , you can ' t live your life in fear.
I wish you all the best of luck in maintaining that balance in your future endeavors.

And there it was , the seat of human consciousness , the powerhouse of the human body , sitting in my hands.
on the neurological causes of dyslexia in children that I encountered a startling fact that I ' d like to share with you all today.
But here ' s what really perplexed me.
To diagnose and treat a brain disorder accurately , it would be necessary to look at the brain directly.
Their groundbreaking technology records the EEG , or the electrical activity of the brain , in real time , allowing us to watch the brain as it performs various functions and then detect even the slightest abnormality in any of these functions : vision , attention , language , audition.
And I ' m happy to say that I ' m now in the process of setting up this technology here in India.
There were moments when he would actually space out for seconds at a time.
He was suffering from brain seizures that were impossible to see with the naked eye , but that were actually causing symptoms that mimicked those of autism.
Research shows that 50 percent of children , almost 50 percent of children diagnosed with autism are actually suffering from hidden brain seizures.
So these EEG scans enabled us to provide these children with a much more accurate neurological diagnosis and much more targeted treatment.
So if I could inspire even a fraction of you in the audience today to share this pioneering diagnostic approach with even one parent whose child is suffering from a developmental disorder , then perhaps one more puzzle in one more brain will be solved.
http://www.ted.com/talks/nora_york_sings_what_i_want.html
Nora York sings  " What I Want " 
The SETI Institute ' s Jill Tarter makes her TED Prize wish : to accelerate our search for cosmic company . Using a growing array of radio telescopes , she and her team listen for patterns that may be a sign of intelligence elsewhere in the universe.
So , my question : are we alone ? 
Here.
From my perspective , we live on a fragile island of life , in a universe of possibilities.
Well , if we are , it ' s an awful waste of space.
Would the discovery of an older cultural civilization out there inspire us to find ways to survive our increasingly uncertain technological adolescence ? 
Fifty years ago , the journey to find answers took a different path and SETI , the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence , began.
It might be that some massive network of communications , or some shield against asteroidal impact , or some huge astro-engineering project that we can ' t even begin to conceive of , could generate signals at radio or optical frequencies that a determined program of searching might detect.
The numbers suggest a universe of possibilities.
Now , I ' m going to try a trick , and recreate an experiment from this morning.
Now , up there , 20 feet above the stage , that ' s 10 trillion.
16 times farther away than the moon , or four percent of the distance to the sun.
But those environments are going to be widely spaced in this universe.
And the edge of our galaxy is 75,000 light years away , and the nearest galaxy to us , 2.5 million light years.
It tells us about their past , but detection of a signal tells us it ' s possible for us to have a long future.
So , ultimately what ' s going to determine the success or failure of SETI is the longevity of technologies , and the mean distance between technologies in the cosmos -- distance over space and distance over time.
Let me talk about a relatively small number.
Life happened very quickly , and that bodes well for the potential of life elsewhere in the cosmos.
We are not the pinnacle of evolution.
And Homo sapiens are one small leaf on a very extensive Tree of Life , which is densely populated by organisms that have been honed for survival over millions of years.
It ' s a sense of privilege that the natural universe doesn ' t share.
Occasionally , throughout history , this concept of this very large cosmic perspective comes to the surface , and as a result we see transformative and profound discoveries.
And in 1960 , Frank Drake conducted the first SETI observation looking at two stars , Tau Ceti and Epsilon Eridani , for about 150 hours.
And no one would decide that the ocean was without fish on the basis of one glass of water.
It ' s making silicon as important as aluminum , and we ' ll grow it in the future by adding more antennas to reach 350 for more sensitivity and leveraging Moore ' s law for more processing capability.
It may be hard for your eye to see it , but it ' s easily found with our efficient algorithms.
And next month , the Kepler Spacecraft will launch and will begin to tell us just how frequent Earth-like planets are , the targets for SETI ' s searches.
Well , this is the question the Edge foundation asked this year , and four of the respondents said ,  " SETI. " 
I think it ' s a problem of completion and delivery , because the fine print said ,  " What game-changing ideas and scientific developments would you expect to live to see ?  " 
I wish that you would empower Earthlings everywhere to become active participants in the ultimate search for cosmic company.
We ' d like to use the pattern recognition capability of the human eye to find faint , complex signals that our current algorithms miss.
I ' m sorry Seth Godin , but over the millennia , we ' ve seen where tribalism leads.
If SETI does nothing but change the perspective of humans on this planet , then it will be one of the most profound endeavors in history.
Nathaniel Kahn shares clips from his documentary  " My Architect, "  about his quest to understand his father , the legendary architect Louis Kahn . It ' s a film with meaning to anyone who seeks to understand the relationship between art and love.
One thing I wanted to say about film making is -- about this film -- in thinking about some of the wonderful talks we ' ve heard here , Michael Moschen , and some of the talks about music , this idea that there is a narrative line , and that music exists in time.
So instead of doing the talking head thing , instead it ' s composed of scenes , and we meet people along the way.
There are two clips I want to show you , the first one is a kind of hodgepodge , its just three little moments , four little moments with three of the people who are here tonight.
I think he felt that the greatest things in life were accidental , and perhaps not planned at all.
We were the first film crew in there.
It is the capital of the country , and it took 23 years to build , which is something they seem to be very proud of over there.
The building was finished in 1983.
So , those are the two clips I ' m going to show.
I know you ' ve never heard of him , but just mark this day that someday you will hear of him , because he ' s really an amazing man. " 
FG : Yeah , when he was in Rome.
I mean as tragic as his death was in a railway station , it was so consistent with his life , you know ? 
Louis Kahn : How accidental our existences are really and how full of influence by circumstance.
Man : Yes , it is the national image of Bangladesh.
Man : Oh! Dad is Louis Farrakhan ? 
NK : No , he ' s been dead for 25 years.
No , he never saw this.
He is not a political man , but in this guise he has given us the institution for democracy , from where we can rise.
NK : It cost him his life.
But I think his son will understand this , and will have no sense of grudge , or sense of being neglected , I think.
You see , only that way you can be able to understand him.
You have to understand that.
In this energizing talk , Amory Lovins lays out his simple plan for weaning the US off oil and revitalizing the economy.
The old story about climate protection is that it ' s costly , or it would have been done already.
Many other firms -- IBM -- are reducing their energy intensity routinely six percent a year by fixing up their plants , and they get their money back in two or three years.
But the new story about oil is the government doesn ' t have to force us to do painful things to get off oil -- not just incrementally , but completely -- quite the contrary . The United States , for example , can completely eliminate its use of oil and rejuvenate the economy at the same time , led by business for profit , because it ' s so much cheaper to save and substitute for the oil than to keep on buying it.
Now , a bit of economic history , I think , may be helpful here.
So , very unexpectedly , they ran out of customers before they ran out of whales.
So when we did , we found some very surprising things.
And serious competition from Europe , from Korea , and next is China , which will soon be a major net exporter of cars.
They ' re not going to export your uncle ' s Buick.
Will we in the United States continue to import efficient cars to replace foreign oil , or will we make efficient cars and import neither the oil nor the cars ? 
It could well be enough to double the oil price , for example.
Now , in order to avoid these problems , whatever you think they ' re worth , it ' s actually not that complicated.
And compared with the official forecast , that oil will cost 26 dollars a barrel in 2025 , which is half of what we ' ve been paying lately , that will save 70 billion dollars a year , starting quite soon.
And we ' ll also get returns over 150 billion dollars a year.
And these policies work fine without taxes , subsidies or mandates.
You can sort of have it all with these things.
Well , saving that fuel , 69 percent of the fuel in light vehicles costs about 57 cents per saved gallon.
And we intend to use those numbers to create demand pull , and flip the market.
And if you go over the next 15 years or so to a blended-wing body , kind of a flying wing with internal engines , then you get about a factor three efficiency improvement at comparable or lower cost.
And only this little bit , only six percent actually ends up accelerating the car and then heating the brakes when you stop.
And it ' s obvious from the diagram that every unit of energy you save at the wheels is going to avoid wasting another seven units of energy getting that energy to the wheels.
For example , we use a lot of carbon-fiber composites in sporting goods.
The McLaren just popped off and scratched the side panel.
And this means we ' ve just cracked the conundrum of safety and weight.
You can end up saving money , and lives , and oil , all at the same time.
And the manufacturing you can do this way gets radically simplified.
They snap together like a kid ' s toy.
So you end up with at least two-fifths lower capital intensity than the leanest plant in the industry , which GM has in Lansing.
There is a huge amount of gas to be saved , about half the projected gas at about an eighth of its price.
Maybe you ought to buy efficiency at 26 bucks instead of 12.
Or we could use the saved gas directly to cover all of this balance , or if we used it as hydrogen , which is more profitable and efficient , we ' d get rid of the domestic oil too.
Now , to make this happen quicker and with higher confidence , there is a few ways government could help.
This expands choice rapidly in the market , and actually makes more money for automakers as well.
And Detroit will make money on every unit.
There are smart ways to buy them and to aggregate that purchasing power to bring very efficient vehicles into the market faster.
And at the same time to scrap inefficient old planes , so that if they were otherwise to come back in the air , they would waste more oil , and block the uptake of efficient , new planes.
That in creating the move to high-volume , low-cost commercial production of these kinds of materials , or for that matter , ultra-light steels that are a good backup technology , the military can do the trick it did in turning DARPAnet into the Internet.
That is , military science and technology that they need can create the advanced materials-industrial cluster that transforms its civilian economy and gets the country off oil , which would be a huge contribution to eliminating conflict over oil and advancing national and global security.
Instead of official forecasts of oil use and oil imports going forever up , they can turn down with the 12 dollars a barrel efficiency , down steeply by adding the supply-side substitutions at 18 bucks , all implemented at slower rates than we ' ve done before when we paid attention.
They would have been gone if we ' d kept that up one more year.
Ours is on the demand side.

Early explorers rubbed cocaine in their eyes to kill the pain of it.
Nowhere on Earth offers us such a perfect record.
There , about 45 scientists from the University of Wisconsin , the Desert Research Institute in Nevada and others have been working to answer a central question about global warming.
And we know that levels of greenhouse gases are rising too.
In blizzard winds , the crew sling ropes between the tents so that people can feel their way safely to the nearest ice house and to the nearest outhouse.
It makes for an exotic and chilly commute.
It ' s really a time machine.
More importantly , they prepare it for inspection and analysis by 27 independent laboratories in the United States and Europe , who will examine it for 40 different trace chemicals related to climate , some in parts per quadrillion.
This ice formed as snow 15,800 years ago , when our ancestors were daubing themselves with paint and considering the radical new technology of the alphabet.
Each storm scours the atmosphere , washing out dust , soot , trace chemicals , and depositing them on the snow pack year after year , millennia after millennia , creating a kind of periodic table of elements that at this point is more than 11,000 feet thick.
Each cylinder is about 10 percent ancient air , a pristine time capsule of greenhouse gases -- carbon dioxide , methane , nitrous oxide -- all unchanged from the day that snow formed and first fell.
Don ' t we already know how they affect temperatures ? 
Consider , the single most successful international environmental effort of the 20th century , the Montreal Protocol , in which the nations of Earth banded together to protect the planet from the harmful effects of ozone-destroying chemicals used at that time in air conditioners , refrigerators and other cooling devices.
Moreover , in this 8,000-mile journey , they have to insure this ice doesn ' t melt.
As they handle the ice , in fact , they keep an extra pair of gloves warming in an oven , so that , when their work gloves freeze and their fingers stiffen , they can don a fresh pair.
The 109th Air National Guard flew the most recent shipment of ice back to the coast of Antarctica , where it was boarded onto a freighter , shipped across the tropics to California , unloaded , put on a truck , driven across the desert to the National Ice Core Laboratory in Denver , Colorado , where , as we speak , scientists are now slicing this material up for samples , for analysis , to be distributed to the laboratories around the country and in Europe.
The wind that rubs against it gives it voice.
A TED archive gem . At TED in 1998 , Brenda Laurel asks : Why are all the top-selling videogames aimed at little boys ?  She spent two years researching the world of girls to create a game that girls would love.
Back in 1992 , I started working for a company called Interval Research , which was just then being founded by David Lidell and Paul Allen as a for-profit research enterprise in Silicon Valley.
Why is that ? 
They would go for it if they could figure out how.
So , contrary to popular belief , there is not a conflict of interest between empiricism and values.
Then we formed a spin-off company.
Thank you Frans de Waal , wherever you are , I love you and I ' d give anything to meet you.
And at the end of those remarkable conversations with kids and their best friends across the United States , after two years , we pulled together some survey data from another 10,000 children , drew up a set up of what we thought were the key findings of our research , and spent another year transforming them into design heuristics , for designing computer-based products -- and , in fact , any kind of products -- for little girls , ages eight to 12.
They visit an average of one and a half times a day , spend an average of 35 minutes a visit , and look at 50 pages a visit.
Who are my friends ?  "  ; to exercise the love of social complexity and the narrative intelligence that drives most of their play behavior ; and which embeds in it values about noticing that we have lots of choices in our lives and the ways that we conduct ourselves.
We ' ve made half-a-billion impressions with marketing and PR for this brand , Purple Moon.
One kind of reviewer is a male gamer who thinks he knows what games ought to be , and won ' t show the product to little girls.
I ' d like to play you some voices of little girls from the two-and-a-half years of research that we did -- actually , some of the voices are more recent.
Hers is more into boys.
Girl 3 : This is my pretend [unclear] one.
Girl 7 : I run track , I played soccer , I play basketball , and I love a lot of things to do.
Girl 10 : Well , sometimes it gets annoying when your brothers and sisters , or brother or sister , when they copy you and you get your idea first and they take your idea and they do it themselves.
Let ' s hope it ' s really stable.
Miko : Hey Rockett! C ' mere!
Nakilia invited Reuben too , but -- Rockett : But what ?  Isn ' t he coming ? 
Girl : Max ' s party is going to be so cool , Whitney.
Rockett : Who ' d want to show up at that party anyway ? 
If we were playing the game , that ' s what we ' d do.
But you get the general idea of the product.
We love them.
It turns out they ' re really great.
BL : Thanks.

This is Hermann Goering.
And what he really wanted was something by Vermeer.
World War II came to an end , and Goering was captured , tried at Nuremberg and ultimately sentenced to death.
Six weeks into his prison sentence , van Meegeren confessed.
Now nobody believed him.
So they brought him in.
There ' s a lot more to be said about van Meegeren , but I want to turn now to Goering , who ' s pictured here being interrogated at Nuremberg.
But you could feel sympathy for the reaction he had when he was told that his favorite painting was actually a forgery.
It looked the same , but it had a different origin , it was a different artwork.
In particular ,  " The Supper at Emmaus "  which was viewed as Vermeer ' s finest masterpiece , his best work -- people would come [from] all over the world to see it -- was actually a forgery.
I ' m a psychologists -- why do origins matter so much ? 
Among other things , if you want to show off how rich you are , how powerful you are , it ' s always better to own an original than a forgery because there ' s always going to be fewer originals than forgeries.
Rather , our response is conditioned on our beliefs , about what they really are , what they came from , what they ' re made of , what their hidden nature is.
Would you eat this ? 
Few of you would eat it if it ' s a rat or a human.
So one demonstration of this was done with young children.
How do you get adults to really enjoy wine ? 
They get people into a fMRI scanner , and while they ' re lying there , through a tube , they get to sip wine.
It ' s not just that you say it ' s more pleasurable , you say you like it more , you really experience it in a different way.
But how attractive you find them , how sexually or romantically moved you are by them , rests critically on who you think you ' re looking at.
It will make a difference if you were to discover that the person you ' re looking at with lust is actually a disguised version of your son or daughter , your mother or father.
This is why spouses in happy marriages tend to think that their husband or wife looks much better than anyone else thinks that they do.
Now often , a result of Capgras syndrome is tragic.
 " Research described a woman with Capgras syndrome who complained about her poorly endowed and sexually inadequate lover. " 
As a third example , consider consumer products.
The golf clubs were owned by John F . Kennedy and sold for three-quarters of a million dollars at auction.
According to an unconfirmed report , a Saudi millionaire offered 10 million dollars for this pair of shoes.
You could get something that looked like it or felt like it , but you couldn ' t get the same object back.
Then we asked them ,  " How much would you pay for George Clooney ' s sweater ?  " 
That drops the value of it , suggesting that that ' s one reason why we like it.
So let ' s go back to art.
That ' s not because , or it ' s not simply because , I ' m a snob and want to boast about having an original.
And that could explain the difference between an original and a forgery.
This is a work by Jackson Pollock.
I ' m not going to make a claim about who ' s right , but I will make an empirical claim about people ' s intuitions , which is that , if you like the work of Jackson Pollock , you ' ll tend more so than the people who don ' t like it to believe that these works are difficult to create , that they require a lot of time and energy and creative energy.
And they then reported that her father was coaching her.
This is Joshua Bell , a very famous violinist.
And here ' s a brief clip of this.
He actually made 20 dollars more than that , but he didn ' t count it.
So she ' s struck with pity.
And people have different views on this.
And how you think about what you ' re experiencing , your beliefs about the essence of it , affect how it hurts.
So it was a series of five painful shocks.
The second shock feels less painful , because you get a bit used to it.
The first shock hurts like hell.
Humans have this extraordinarily interesting property that will often seek out low-level doses of pain in controlled circumstances and take pleasure from it -- as in the eating of hot chili peppers and roller coaster rides.
Every day there are news reports of new health advice , but how can you know if they ' re right ?  Doctor and epidemiologist Ben Goldacre shows us , at high speed , the ways evidence can be distorted , from the blindingly obvious nutrition claims to the very subtle tricks of the pharmaceutical industry.
So I ' m a doctor , but I kind of slipped sideways into research , and now I ' m an epidemiologist.
And these are just some of the examples.
Here are some of the things they say prevents cancer : crusts , red pepper , licorice and coffee.
So for women , housework prevents breast cancer , but for men , shopping could make you impotent.
That ' s what happens in academic journals.
It ' s like a consenting intellectual S&M activity.
In science , we don ' t care how many letters you have after your name.
This is somebody called Dr . Gillian McKeith Ph.D , or , to give her full medical title , Gillian McKeith.
She , it turns out , has a non-accredited correspondence course Ph.D.
This one belongs to my dead cat Hetti . She was a horrible cat.
And anybody who ' s done school biology remembers that chlorophyll and chloroplasts only make oxygen in sunlight , and it ' s quite dark in your bowels after you ' ve eaten spinach.
 " A glass of red wine a day could help prevent breast cancer. " 
Actually , it turns out that your risk of breast cancer actually increases slightly with every amount of alcohol that you drink.
 " An Australian study in 2001 found that olive oil in combination with fruits , vegetables and pulses offers measurable protection against skin wrinklings. " 
Obviously nobody has been able to go back to 1930 , get all the people born in one maternity unit , and half of them eat lots of fruit and veg and olive oil , and then half of them eat McDonald ' s , and then we see how many wrinkles you ' ve got later.
They are posh , they ' re wealthy , they ' re less likely to have outdoor jobs , they ' re less likely to do manual labor , they have better social support , they ' re less likely to smoke -- so for a whole host of fascinating , interlocking social , political and cultural reasons , they are less likely to have skin wrinkles.
Trials are very old . The first trial was in the Bible -- Daniel 1:12.
And the claim was fish oil pills improve school performance and behavior in mainstream children.
Because if you already know the answer to your trial , you shouldn ' t be doing one.
Now can anybody spot a flaw in this design ? 
That ' s a technical term.
And of course , also there ' s the placebo effect.
It ' s about the cultural meaning of a treatment.
And that ' s an outrageous and ridiculous finding , but it ' s true.
What I ' ve just shown you are examples of the very simple and straightforward ways that journalists and food supplement pill peddlers and naturopaths can distort evidence for their own purposes.
Because often we already have a very good treatment that is currently available , so we don ' t want to know that your alternative new treatment is better than nothing.
But that ' s not the only way you can rig your data.
And this is exactly what happened which antipsychotic medication for schizophrenia.
10 years ago , history repeated itself , interestingly , when risperidone , which was the first of the new-generation antipscyhotic drugs , came off copyright , so anybody could make copies.
And so it ' s no surprise that overall , industry-funded trials are four times more likely to give a positive result than independently sponsored trials.
How can we explain this strange phenomenon ? 
We need to have all of the data on a particular treatment to know whether or not it really is effective.
This is something called funnel plot.
And as you go up , those are the bigger trials , so they ' ve got less error in them.
Then as you go further down at the bottom , what you can see is , over on this side , the spurious false negatives , and over on this side , the spurious false positives.
And I think that ' s the funniest epidemiology joke that you will ever hear.
This is a drug that I myself have prescribed to patients.
I found no flaw.
If we remove half of the data , we can never know what the true effect size of these medicines is.
The Cochrane Groups are an international nonprofit collaboration that produce systematic reviews of all of the data that has ever been shown.
And to show how big it goes , this is a drug called Tamiflu , which governments around the world have spent billions and billions of dollars on.
I ' m very sorry if you have the flu , I know it ' s horrible , but we ' re not going to spend billions of dollars trying to reduce the duration of your flu symptoms by half a day.
We cannot make decisions in the absence of all of the information.
And I think , with all of the problems in science , one of the best things that we can do is to lift up the lid , finger around in the mechanics and peer in.
525
And each one of these forces split the world , tore the world apart , divided the world.
Here are some data on tariffs : starting at 40 percent , coming down to less than 5 percent.
You know in 1950 the typical ship carried 5,000 to 10,000 tons worth of goods.
Now all of this has been tremendous for the world.
By 2007 : over 300 billion dollars.
Never before in human history have so many people been raised out of such great poverty as happened in China.
And over the next 18 years have almost tripled.
Growth was negative.
Now why.
Now ideas have this amazing property.
Or to put it slightly differently : one apple feeds one man , but an idea can feed the world. " 
This provides a reason why trade and globalization are even more important , more powerful than ever before , and are going to increase growth more than ever before.
Common , the common -- I think that ' s absolutely right , and why ?  Because there are more drugs to treat common diseases than there are to treat rare diseases.
So the incentives are much larger to produce drugs which treat more people.
Now we are not there yet , but it is happening.
For the Hollywood people in the audience , this even explains why action movies have larger budgets than comedies : it ' s because action movies translate easier into other languages and other cultures , so the market for those movies is larger.
The way I like to put this is : one idea . Ideas are meant to be shared , so one idea can serve one world , one market.
Globalize trade.
Artists and innovators -- many of the people you ' ve seen on this stage.
A large fraction of those people are in the United States.
It is fortunate that we are becoming less of an idea leader because for too long the United States , and a handful of other developed countries , have shouldered the entire burden of research and development.
Now we ' re not there yet.
India is coming on line.
1996 : less than one million new university students in China per year ; 2006 : over five million.
That is something that we should embrace -- a wealthy China , a wealthy India , a wealthy Africa.
Investments in education are increasing the supply of new ideas.
1900s : maybe one percent.
That ' s not U.S . GDP per capita , which will be over a million , but world GDP per capita -- $200,000.
And I should say , I think this is a rather modest prediction.
What about a great depression ? 
What would you have predicted , not knowing this ? 
We went off a cliff but we recovered.
Oil . Oil . This was a big topic.
But I think I don ' t have to tell this audience that a higher price of oil is not necessarily a bad thing.
As oil prices go up , energy patents go up.
Now remember here what Jefferson said.
So my view is : Be optimistic.
culture,empathy,global issues,iraq,politics,society,war
And I tell them ,  " It ' s the study of the way in which human beings are shaped by things that they don ' t see. " 
Start with empathy.
So I imagine my life : if a hundred years ago China had been the most powerful nation in the world and they came to the United States in search of coal , and they found it , and , in fact , they found lots of it right here.
And back here in the United States , we saw economic despair , deprivation.
I say ,  " How ' s it possible that we could be so poor here in the United States , because the coal is such a wealthy resource , it ' s so much money ?  " 
Does this sound familiar ? 
Nothing . They don ' t talk about us . They don ' t talk about the coal.
And so I get angry , and I get pissed , as do lots of average people.
Can you imagine what you would feel if you were in my shoes ? 
And you just feel the anger and you feel the fear.
Okay , so that ' s the warm up.
And so to help you , perhaps you ' re a member of this middle class family in Baghdad -- and what you want is the best for your kids.
So you have a sense of what the Americans are thinking.
You want a better life for yourself.
It ' s all about oil ; you know that , everybody knows that.
It ' s your land ; it ' s your resource.
Because they have an entire economic system that ' s dependent on that oil -- foreign oil , oil from other parts of the world that they don ' t own.
You think that . It ' s not true , of course , but that ' s the media impression , and that ' s like what you get.
Look , you don ' t live in a wealthy country.
I mean , it ' s not easy ; you see a lot of poverty.
There ' s this thing , this militarization of the world , and it ' s centered right in the United States.
And you talk about it with your friends.
When oil was at stake , somehow , suddenly , things mattered.
Oh , these incursions , these two wars , the 10 years of sanctions , the eight years of occupation , the insurgency that ' s been unleashed on your people , the tens of thousands , the hundreds of thousands of civilian deaths , all because of oil.
You say ,  " How is that possible ?  " 
Not a single person in your country has not been touched.
And what do you see ?  They ' re Christians.
And their leaders , their leaders : before they send their sons and daughters off to war in your country -- and you know the reason -- before they send them off , they go to a Christian church , and they pray to their Christian God , and they ask for protection and guidance from that god.
And they do wonderful things.
And this guy , you get a guy like Lt . Gen . William Boykin.
And you know that . Americans don ' t read about this guy.
He was one of the leading commanders in the second invasion of Iraq.
Whatever . I don ' t know. " 
If they won ' t submit , kill them.
You feel frightened . Of course you feel frightened.
They laugh him off . You don ' t laugh him off.
These Christians , who are these Christians ? 
And then your cousin says ,  " Hey cuz , check out this website.
And they take these little kids and they run them through these things till they teach them how to say ,  " Sir , yes , sir, "  and things like grenade toss and weapons care and maintenance.
And you ' re reading this website.
It ' s all over the Web , Bible Boot Camp.
So these guys , you see them.
When you see them , they ' re something else , they ' re something else.
Of course , you got it wrong.
We ' re not just there for oil ; we ' re there for lots of reasons.
But some of you do.
So everyone ' s back in the room , okay.
I feel her.
So here ' s what I want you to do.
And what I want you to do is picture her as a Chinese woman receiving a Chinese flag because her loved one has died in America in the coal uprising.
Okay , try this . Bring it back.
What are you feeling and thinking about this photo , about this woman ? 
They were caught by the American soldiers , trying to kill Americans.
Can you feel that you just want to take these guys and wring their necks ? 
Now , put yourself in their shoes.
Can you imagine that maybe one of them in the morning bent down to their child and hugged their child and said ,  " Dear , I ' ll be back later.
Can you imagine saying that ? 
It ' s also understanding.
You ' re allowed to hate these people.
Whatever it is , you can go so far.
And suddenly all these tiny , little worlds , they come together in this complex web.
Everything in your life has changed.
I ' m not saying that I support the terrorists in Iraq , but as a sociologist , what I am saying is I understand.
TED Prize,ants,biodiversity,biology,biosphere,global issues,nature,science,technology
After two days here , I declare myself boggled , and enormously impressed , and feel that you are one of the great hopes -- not just for American achievement in science and technology , but for the whole world.
Now , how did I come to this particular position of advocacy ? 
Out of that broader study has emerged a concern and an ambition , crystallized in the wish that I ' m about to make to you.
I later discovered I was also hard of hearing , possibly congenitally , in the upper registers.
In fact , we live on a mostly unexplored planet.
At the extreme opposite end of the size scale , the class of marine bacteria , the Prochlorococci -- that will be on the final exam -- although discovered only in 1988 , are now recognized as likely the most abundant organisms on Earth , and moreover , responsible for a large part of the photosynthesis that occurs in the ocean.
Consider the fungi -- including mushrooms , rusts , molds and many disease-causing organisms.
About 16,000 species of nematode worms have been discovered and diagnosed by scientists ; there could be hundreds of thousands of them , even millions , still unknown.
So the question is : what are they all doing ? 
To take an example close to home : there are over 500 species of bacteria now known -- friendly bacteria -- living symbiotically in your mouth and throat probably necessary to your health for holding off pathogenic bacteria.
And that may be just the beginning!
Nowadays , in addressing microbial biodiversity , scientists are like explorers in a rowboat launched onto the Pacific Ocean.
What will we find as we map the living world , as , finally , we get this underway seriously ? 
True aliens , stocks that arrived from outer space.
But each of these species , even the tiniest Prochlorococci , are masterpieces of evolution.
My own epiphany as a conservationist came in 1953 , while a Harvard graduate student , searching for rare ants found in the mountain forests of Cuba , ants that shine in the sunlight -- metallic green or metallic blue , according to species , and one species , I discovered , metallic gold.
The human juggernaut is permanently eroding Earth ' s ancient biosphere by a combination of forces that can be summarized by the acronym  " HIPPO, "  the animal hippo.
The second is for continued population , human population expansion.
What will we and all future generations lose if much of the living environment is thus degraded ? 
For example , even in the United States , the 200,000 species known currently actually has been found to be only partial in coverage ; it is mostly unknown to us in basic biology.
We are , in short , flying blind into our environmental future.
And we need that knowledge.
I wish we will work together to help create the key tools that we need to inspire preservation of Earth ' s biodiversity.
Amateurs can do it also.
But what excites me is that since I first put forward this particular idea in that form , science has advanced.
I wish you would help them.
It will transform the science of biology in ways of obvious benefit to humanity.
When Jarrett J . Krosoczka was a kid , he didn’t play sports , but he <em>loved</em> art . He paints the funny and touching story of a little boy who pursued a simple passion : to draw and write stories . With the help of a supporting cast of family and teachers , our protagonist grew up to become the successful creator of beloved children’s book characters , and a vocal advocate for arts education . <em></em>
Hello . My name is Jarrett Krosoczka , and I write and illustrate books for children for a living.
And when your parent is a drug addict , it ' s kind of like Charlie Brown trying to kick the football , because as much as you want to love on that person , as much as you want to receive love from that person , every time you open your heart , you end up on your back.
I was the Cousin Oliver of the sitcom of the Krosoczka family , the new kid who came out of nowhere.
And they supported my creative efforts , because my grandfather was a self-made man.
So my best friends in life were the characters I read about in books.
An author visited our school , Jack Gantos.
But he stopped next to my desk , and he tapped on my desk , and he said ,  " Nice cat. " 
We had to write our own Greek myth , our own creation story , so I wrote a story about an owl who challenged Hermes to a flying race , and the owl cheated , and Hermes , being a Greek god , grew angry and bitter , and turned the owl into a moon , so the owl had to live the rest of his life as a moon while he watched his family and friends play at night.
And it was a story that was told with words and pictures , exactly what I do now for a living , and I sometimes let the words have the stage on their own , and sometimes I allowed the pictures to work on their own to tell the story.
And I liked making that book because I loved using my imagination , and that ' s what writing is.
There was an egg , a tomato , a head of lettuce and a pumpkin , and they all lived in this refrigerator city , and in one of their adventures they went to a haunted house that was filled with so many dangers like an evil blender who tried to chop them up , an evil toaster who tried to kidnap the bread couple , and an evil microwave who tried to melt their friend who was a stick of butter.
And my grandfather , he was a wise man , and he saw that as a problem , because he knew that was , like , the one thing I had . I didn ' t play sports.
So from sixth through 12th grade , once , twice , sometimes three times a week , I would take classes at the art museum , and I was surrounded by other kids who loved to draw , other kids who shared a similar passion.
So I get shipped off to private school , K through eight , public schools , but for some reason my grandfather was upset that somebody at the local high school had been stabbed and killed , so he didn ' t want me to go there.
And I just flourished here.
Well , in English class , in ninth grade , my friend John , who was sitting next to me , laughed a little bit too hard.
And he came out to the hallway and he said ,  " Let me see the paper. " 
 " You ' re really good . You know , the school newspaper needs a new cartoonist , and you should be the cartoonist.
And I took the headmaster to task and then I also wrote an ongoing story about a boy named Wesley who was unlucky in love , and I just swore up and down that this wasn ' t about me , but all these years later it was totally me.
Here I am , 20 years later , and I still work on this table every day.
Now I never really asked my grandparents for anything.
And after begging and pleading for Christmas , I got a second-hand video camera , and I instantly started making my own animations on my own , and all throughout high school I made my own animations.
Mark Lynch , he ' s an amazing teacher and he ' s still a dear friend of mine , and I was 14 or 15 , and I walked into his comic book class halfway through the course , and I was so excited , I was beaming.
Celebrate your own style . Don ' t draw the way you ' re being told to draw.
And on the day I met my father for the first time , I was rejected from the Rhode Island School of Design , my one and only choice for college.
and I started writing books for young readers when I was a senior in high school.
And I sent this book out to a dozen publishers and it was rejected every single time , but I was also involved with the Hole in the Wall Gang Camp , an amazing camp for kids with all sorts of critical illnesses , and it ' s those kids at the camp that read my stories , and I read to them , and I saw that they responded to my work.
And my grandfather would call me every week , and he would say ,  " Jarrett , how ' s it going ?  Do you have a job yet ?  " 
And I said ,  " No one , no one , no one just yet.
And I received an email from an editor at Random House with a subject line ,  " Nice work! "  Exclamation point.
And this was from an editor at Random House Children ' s Books.
The local bookstore made a big deal of it.
They were so happy . They couldn ' t have been more proud.
I got my first piece of significant fan mail , where this kid loved Monkey Boy so much that he wanted to have a Monkey Boy birthday cake.
And I got this picture , and I thought ,  " This picture is going to live within his consciousness for his entire life . He will forever have this photo in his family photo albums. " 
I just finished the ninth book in the  " Lunch Lady "  series , which is a graphic novel series about a lunch lady who fights crime.
Lunch ladies treat me really well.
I ' ve seen people have  " Punk Farm "  birthday parties , people have dressed up as  " Punk Farm "  for Halloween , a  " Punk Farm "  baby room , which makes me a little nervous for the child ' s well-being in the long term.
And it displayed the work from my first 10 years of publishing , and you know who was there to celebrate ?  Mrs . Alisch.
So the biggest moment for me , though , my most important job now is I am a dad myself , and I have two beautiful daughters , and my goal is to surround them by inspiration , by the books that are in every single room of our house to the murals I painted in their rooms to the moments for creativity where you find , in quiet times , by making faces on the patio to letting her sit in the very desk that I ' ve sat in for the past 20 years.

I love the idea that you can transform , become somebody else and look at life with a completely new perspective.
Theater awakens our senses and opens the door to our imagination.
 " Upwake "  tells the story of Zero , a modern-day business man , going to work with his life in a suitcase , stuck between dream and reality and not able to decipher the two.
If Antoine de Saint-Exupery , the author of  " The Little Prince, "  were here , he would have drawn three holes inside that box and told you your sheep was inside.
I wanted to create environments that moved and morphed like an illusionist.
Technology is an instrument that allowed me to manifest my visions in high definition , live , on stage.
Thank you.
I didn ' t use it as a special effect , but as a partner on stage.
And here are some excerpts.
When I arrived at one of the schools , I certainly did not expect this : Six hundred kids , packed in a gymnasium , waiting.
Something happened along the way.
It ' s as much about bringing new disciplines inside this box as it is about taking theater out of its box.
It ' s as though the mystery of the person they ' re interacting with and connecting allows them to be themselves just a bit more.
I ' ve worked as a doctor clown in a hospital for two years.
Comic books . Quantum physics video games.
There is a revolution.
It ' s visual . It ' s musical . It ' s sensorial.
There is a revolution in the way that we think , in the way that we share , and the way that we express our stories , our evolution.

Steven Pinker on language and thought
They ' re now working on their ninth edition , which they began in 1930 , and they ' ve reached the letter P.
But anyone who looks at language realizes that this is a rather silly conceit , that language , rather , emerges from human minds interacting from one another.
In a book that I ' m currently working on , I hope to use language to shed light on a number of aspects of human nature , including the cognitive machinery with which humans conceptualize the world and the relationship types that govern human interaction.
The verb is the chassis of the sentence.
You have to say ,  " Sam dined, "  not ,  " Sam dined the pizza. " 
For example , the dative construction in English.
Hundreds of verbs can go both ways.
This would be an example of how to do that.
The solution is that these constructions , despite initial appearance , are not synonymous , that when you crank up the microscope on human cognition , you see that there ' s a subtle difference in meaning between them.
Well , in both cases , the thing that is construed as being affected is expressed as the direct object , the noun after the verb.
To give something involves both causing something to go and causing someone to have.
You may just be loud or obnoxious , or some other way causing them to have the headache.
First , there ' s a level of fine-grained conceptual structure , which we automatically and unconsciously compute every time we produce or utter a sentence , that governs our use of language.
Doesn ' t care about perceptual qualities , such as color , texture , weight and speed , which virtually never differentiate the use of verbs in different constructions.
It evokes the container metaphor of communication , in which we conceive of ideas as objects , sentences as containers , and communication as a kind of sending.
For example , you can use the verb  " go "  and the prepositions  " to "  and  " from "  in a literal , spatial sense.
Likewise , we use  " force "  to indicate not only physical force , as in ,  " Rose forced the door to open, "  but also interpersonal force , but by issuing a threat.
And I think the biggest picture of all would take seriously the fact that so much of our verbiage about abstract events is based on a concrete metaphor and see human intelligence itself as consisting of a repertoire of concepts -- such as objects , space , time , causation and intention -- which are useful in a social , knowledge-intensive species , whose evolution you can well imagine , and a process of metaphorical abstraction that allows us to bleach these concepts of their original conceptual content -- space , time and force -- and apply them to new abstract domains , therefore allowing a species that evolved to deal with rocks and tools and animals , to conceptualize mathematics , physics , law and other abstract domains.
And you might remember the scene in which the kidnapper is pulled over by a police officer , is asked to show his driver ' s license and holds his wallet out with a 50-dollar bill extending at a slight angle out of the wallet.
 " Would you like to come up and see my etchings ?  " 
No one ' s fooled.
There ' s an influential taxonomy by the anthropologist Alan Fiske , in which relationships can be categorized , more or less , into communality , which works on the principle  " what ' s mine is thine , what ' s thine is mine, "  the kind of mindset that operates within a family , for example ; dominance , whose principle is  " don ' t mess with me; "  reciprocity ,  " you scratch my back , I ' ll scratch yours; "  and sexuality , in the immortal words of Cole Porter ,  " Let ' s do it. " 
For example , in brotherhoods , fraternal organizations , sororities , locutions like  " the family of man, "  you try to get people who are not related to use the relationship type that would ordinarily be appropriate to close kin.
In less blatant cases , there ' s still a kind of negotiation that often goes on.
Well , what does this have to do with language ? 
The solution , I think , is that we use language at two levels : the literal form signals the safest relationship with the listener , whereas the implicated content -- the reading between the lines that we count on the listener to perform -- allows the listener to derive the interpretation which is most relevant in context , which possibly initiates a changed relationship.
By expressing it as an if-then statement , you can get the message across without appearing to boss another person around.
Put yourself in the position of the kidnapper wanting to bribe the officer.
In that case , the consequences are rather severe.
On the other hand , with indirect language , if you issue a veiled bribe , then the dishonest officer could interpret it as a bribe , in which case you get the payoff of going free.
I think this affirms something that ' s long been known by diplomats -- namely , that the vagueness of language , far from being a bug or an imperfection , actually might be a feature of language , one that we use to our advantage in social interactions.

Christien Meindertsma : How pig parts make the world turn
In the last year ? 
A lot goes to the U.K. , Germany.
And in these years , I met all kinds people like , for instance , farmers and butchers , which seems logical.
And it consists of seven chapters -- the chapters are skin , bones , meat , internal organs , blood , fat and miscellaneous.
So , in soap , fatty acids made from boiling pork bone fat are used as a hardening agent , but also for giving it a pearl-like effect.
Well , that ' s what the producer says : it ' s  " improving the dough , of course. " 
In the train brakes -- at least in the German train brakes -- there ' s this part of the brake that ' s made of bone ash.
In interior decorating , the pig ' s actually quite there.
I was not planning on showing you any meat because , of course , half the book ' s meat and you probably all know what meats they are.
So , this is sold as cow , but what happens when you slaughter a cow -- at least in industrial factory farming -- they have all these little bits of steak left that they can ' t actually sell as steak , so what they do is they glue them all together with fibrin from pig blood into this really large sausage , then freeze the sausage , cut it in little slices and sell those as steak again.
This actually also goes for wine as well as fruit juice.
Injectable collagen -- or , since the  ' 70s , collagen from pigs -- has been used for injecting into wrinkles.
And while I was making the book , I contacted all the producers of products because I wanted them to send me the real samples and the real specimens.
But they answered and they said ,  " Why , thank you for your email . What an interesting story.
It ' s actually a very low-tech and very high-tech product at the same time.
It ' s really a sort of magical moment.
Great -- and then I didn ' t hear from them for weeks , so I called , and I asked ,  " What ' s going on with the heart valve ?  " 
In total , I found 185 products.
And I think that , in order to take better care of what ' s behind our products -- so , the livestock , the crops , the plants , the non-renewable materials , but also the people that produce these products -- the first step would actually be to know that they are there.

Did you notice this section is foreplay ? 
And what they do for their courtship dance is , they go together , the two of them , the two mates , and they begin to run underwater.
And this Grebe , I think , sort of , mistaked us for a prospect , and started to run along the water next to us , in a courtship dance -- for miles.
Obviously , life can teach us something in the entertainment section . Life has a lot to teach us.
So this is a picture from a Galapagos trip that we took with some wastewater treatment engineers ; they purify wastewater.
That ' s bioprocessing , you know ; that ' s bio-assisted technology : using an organism to do your wastewater treatment is an old , old technology called  " domestication. " 
And they said scaling , which is the build-up of minerals inside of pipes.
And they said , calcium carbonate.
So the same sort of a process , without the proteins , is happening on the inside of their pipes . They didn ' t know.
And I said , well , in the same way that they exude a protein and it starts the crystallization -- and then they all sort of leaned in -- they let go of a protein that stops the crystallization.
The first day they would take a hike , and it was , click , click , click , click . Five minutes later they were back in the boat.
Learning about the natural world is one thing ; learning from the natural world -- that ' s the switch.
10 to 30 -- Craig Venter will probably tell you ; I think there ' s a lot more than 30 million -- well-adapted solutions.
It ' s not slavishly mimicking -- although Al is trying to get the hairdo going -- it ' s not a slavish mimicry ; it ' s taking the design principles , the genius of the natural world , and learning something from it.
So what can we learn about making -- not just computers , but everything ? 
And there ' s a lot of cool technologies out there that life has.
This is the opposite ; this is how we make things.
How does life make the most of things ? 
In other words : structure.
Really quick syllabus.
At all.
Now , you ' ve heard about this in terms of nanotechnology.
But what ' s really interesting : unlike our ceramics that are in kilns , it happens in seawater . It happens near , in and near , the organism ' s body.
Imagine making all of our hard materials that way.
This is at UC Santa Barbara . Look at these diatoms.
On the left , this is a brittle star ; it ' s covered with lenses that the people at Lucent Technologies have found have no distortion whatsoever.
A woman named Joanna Aizenberg , at Lucent , is now learning to do this in a low-temperature process to create these sort of lenses . She ' s also looking at fiber optics.
A guy named Geoff Coates , at Cornell , said to himself , you know , plants do not see CO2 as the biggest poison of our time.
In our fuel cells , we do it with platinum ; life does it with a very , very common iron.
Which is an amazing fossil fuel savings , if we were to just put that on the edge of a wing.
See that up-close picture ? 
Water is going to be our big , grand challenge : quenching thirst.
Pulling water out of Monterey fog and out of the sweaty air in Atlanta , before it gets into a building , are key technologies.
There ' s a company here in San Francisco called MR3 that is embedding mimics of the microbes '  molecules on filters to mine waste streams.
Green chemistry is replacing our industrial chemistry with nature ' s recipe book.
Timed degradation : packaging that is good until you don ' t want it to be good anymore , and dissolves on cue.
There is a problem with vaccines around the world not getting to patients . And the reason is that the refrigeration somehow gets broken ; what ' s called the  " cold chain "  gets broken.
Learning from organisms . This is a session about water -- learning about organisms that can do without water , in order to create a vaccine that lasts and lasts and lasts without refrigeration.
And that means finding a way to do what they do without destroying the place that ' ll take care of their offspring.
Chris Anderson : Talk about foreplay , I -- we need to get to 12 , but really quickly.
OK , so that ' s the healing one.
Right . There ' s a person at Newcastle who has figured out that it ' s a very large neuron.
That means , you know , net fertility farming.
In ensemble , that ' s what whole ecosystems do : they create more and more opportunities for life.
That is , those organisms that have not been able to figure out how to enhance or sweeten their places , are not around to tell us about it.
And it does that in the middle of having great foreplay and meeting their needs . So it ' s not mutually exclusive.
Women aren’t micro--so why do they only get micro-loans ?  At TEDxWomen reporter Gayle Tzemach Lemmon argues that women running all types of firms-- from home businesses to major factories-- are the overlooked key to economic development.
We do not invest in victims , we invest in survivors.
But this is the face of resilience.
I had left ABC news and a career I loved at the age of 30 for business school , a path I knew almost nothing about.
So if you ' re going to talk about jobs , then you have to talk about entrepreneurs.
I went to Afghanistan in 2005 to work on a Financial Times piece , and there I met Kamila , a young women who told me she had just turned down a job with the international community that would have paid her nearly $2,000 a month -- an astronomical sum in that context.
And she said business was even more important for women because earning an income earned respect and money was power for women.
Why are you so passionate ?  " 
And that ' s really how I became an entrepreneur. " 
I went on to Bosnia , and early on in my interviews I met with an IMF official who said ,  " You know , Gayle , I don ' t think we actually have women in business in Bosnia , but there is a lady selling cheese nearby on the side of the road.
By the time we met , she had 20 employees , most of them women , who were sending their boys and their girls to school.
And when this story posted , I ran to my computer to send it to the IMF official.
The biases , whether intentional or otherwise , are pervasive , and so are the misleading mental images.
Why is that ? 
And in many places , they ' re there.
And in the developing world overall , That figure is 40 to 50 percent.
And as the World Bank recently noted , women are stuck in a productivity trap.
And she had come to Washington , not seeking a handout and not seeking a microloan.
We don ' t need to invent solutions because we have them -- cash flow loans based in income rather than assets , loans that use secure contracts rather than collateral , because women often don ' t own land.
I think that is terrific.
How wonderful would it be if we were prepared to replace all of our lofty words with our wallets and invest 500 billion dollars unleashing women ' s economic potential ? 
So the great news is this is an incredible opportunity.
And women can no longer be both half the population and a special interest group.
Secondly , when we talk about men who are succeeding , we rightly consider them icons or pioneers or innovators to be emulated.
This topic of resilience is very personal to me and in many ways has shaped my life.
And when I was applying to business school and felt certain I couldn ' t do it and nobody I knew had done it , I went to my aunt who survived years of beatings at the hand of her husband and escaped a marriage of abuse with only her dignity intact.
 " You will find a job . Take the leap. " 
We are not a special interest group.
We can make a difference , and make a difference , not just for women , but for a global economy that desperately needs their contributions.
http://www.ted.com/talks/joe_sabia_the_technology_of_storytelling.html
Joe Sabia : The technology of storytelling
Now during this time , the book was the king of storytelling.
Because in its 400 years of existence , storytellers never evolved the book as a storytelling device.
He grabbed his pen , he snatched his scissors.
They were happy because the story survived , and that the world would keep on spinning.
And things got a lot more fun when the Internet came around.
And one man would tell the stories of his father by using a platform called Twitter to communicate the excrement his father would gesticulate.
The art of storytelling has remained unchanged.
And for that , the audience -- the lovely , beautiful audience -- would live happily ever after.

And I really want to build green , but I ' m very suspicious of all of these well-meaning articles , people long on moral authority and short on data , telling me how to do these kinds of things.
But can I use a paper towel ? 
Now , if I compare that to a cotton towel that I can use a thousand times , I don ' t have a whole lot of embodied energy until I wash that yogurty towel.
But what about a recycled paper towel that comes in those little half sheets ? 
Unless you ' re like me and you leave the handle in the position of hot even when you turn it on , and then you start to use more energy.
Now imagine someone as twisted as me trying to build a house.
And they are just as suspect in telling us to optimize these little things around the edges and missing the elephant in the living room.
So first , we demolish it.
Now , you can reduce the embodied energy by about 25 percent by using high fly ash concrete.
If we put aluminum windows in this house , we would double the energy use right there.
We also used straw bale infill for our library , which has zero embodied energy.
Except for flooring.
And so the question is : How could we make that back ? 
So what does this mean ? 
But all the calculations for embodied energy are on the blog.

Any of you get really freaked out by that ? 
And it started , as with many great ideas , or many ideas you can ' t get rid of anyway , at a cocktail party.
I said that was stupid , you know , maybe we should just train them to do something useful.
And after 10 years of this , my wife eventually said ,  " Look , you know , you gotta do this thing you ' ve been talking about , and build the vending machine. " 
And as I started looking at them , I was finding that they had hyper-adapted.
We were giving them all sorts of reasons to adapt new ways.
Well , then let ' s build something that we can both benefit from , and find some way to make a new relationship with these species.
They ' re found everywhere on the planet except for the Arctic and the southern tip of South America.
And out of those , nine-tenths of the human growth population is occurring in cities.
But what was really interesting to me was to find out that the birds were adapting in a pretty unusual way.
Here , she ' s trying to get a piece of meat out of a tube.
You see , it wasn ' t working very well.
But she did it all on her own.
That ' s the part where the researchers freak out.
For example , in Sweden , crows will wait for fishermen to drop lines through holes in the ice.
Some students went out and netted some crows , brought them in , and were -- weighed them , and measured them and whatnot , and then let them back out again.
Until they finally graduated and left campus , and -- glad to get away , I ' m sure -- came back sometime later , and found the crows still remembered them.
So we know that these crows are really smart , but the more I dug into this , the more I found that they actually have an even more significant adaptation.
Wait for the light to stop the traffic.
In fact , that ' s old hat for crows.
So , they ' re learning from each other . And research bears this out.
The point being that they ' ve developed cultural adaptation.
We found out they ' re really smart , and we found out that they can teach each other.
And it uses Skinnerian training to shape their behavior over four stages.
And eventually , they eat up all the peanuts.
So , when they get really used to that , we move on to the crows coming back.
Now , like most of us who have gotten used to a good thing , this really pisses them off.
The crows learn that all they have to do is show up , wait for the coin to come out , put the coin in the slot , and then they get their peanut.
Come back , look for the peanut , go away.
They figure it ' s gotta have more to it.
That crow enjoys a temporary monopoly on peanuts , until his friends figure out how to do it , and then there we go.
I think that crows can be trained to do other things.
The main thing , the main point of all this for me is that we can find mutually beneficial systems for these species.

And having grown up in a segregated city , Baltimore , Maryland , I sort of use that idea to go around America with a tape recorder -- thank God for technology -- to interview people , thinking that if I walked in their words -- which is also why I don ' t wear shoes when I perform -- if I walked in their words , that I could sort of absorb America.
So I thought he would be the perfect person to go to to ask about a defining moment in American history.
The gradual slippage --  ' slippage '  is the word used by the people in Watergate , moral slippage -- it ' s a gradual kind of thing , combination of things.
The Atlanta airport is a modern airport , and they should leave the gate there.
You see in the old days we had robots , robots imitated humans.
Just as a train is about to go , a young couple rush in and they ' re just about to close the pneumatic doors.
And so suddenly they ' re looking at me.
So I ' m going to talk to the baby . So I say to the baby , holding my hand over my mouth because my breath must be 100 proof , I say to the baby ,  ' Sir or Madam , what is your considered opinion of the human species ?  '  And the baby looks , you know , the way babies look at you clearly , starts laughing , starts busting out with this crazy little laugh.
We read  ' Huck Finn, '  of course , we read  ' Huck Finn '  of course.
And the official truth , the truth was , the law was , that a black man was a property , was a thing , you see.
 ' Anybody up on that raft with you ?  '  Huck says ,  ' Yeah. '   ' Is he black or white ?  '   ' White. '  And they go off.
It ' s an accretion of moments that add up to where we are now , where trivia becomes news.
So , talk about risk taking . I ' m going to do somebody that nobody likes.
But there are certain other connotations to the word  " risk, "  and the same thing about the word  " nature. "  What is nature ? 
And she said ,  " And then intellectually , I don ' t know enough about the negative imagination.
And I got this in the Maryland Correctional Institute for Women.
 " I began to learn how to cover it up , because I didn ' t want nobody to know that this was happening in my home.
And he beat me too . But that didn ' t change the fact that it was a nightmare for my family ; it was a nightmare.
I ' m just talking about the particular night that she died.
And I ended up with three children , Houston , Myesha and Dominic , who was four months old when I came to jail.
I didn ' t even go and see what was happening.
And then he told her , get up.
I told him ,  ' Let her go to sleep. '  He let her go to sleep.
I didn ' t even want to accept the fact that she was dead , so I went in and I put a mirror to her mouth -- there was no thing , nothing , coming out of her mouth.
We told a security guard that she was missing , though she wasn ' t missing.
And he just laid her right on the shoulder of the highway.
And so I went to both -- two race riots , one of which was the Los Angeles riot . And this next piece is from that.
It was captured on videotape -- technology -- and it was played all over the world.
And that trial came back with two cops going to jail and two cops declared innocent . I was at that trial.
And so this woman , Mrs . Young-Soon Han , I suppose will have taught me the most that I have learned about race.
 " I used to believe America was the best.
But at the end of  ' 92 , when we were in such turmoil , and having all the financial problems , and all the mental problems , I began to really realize that Koreans are completely left out of this society and we are nothing.
And we are high taxpayer . Where do I find justice ? 
They got their rights by destroying innocent Korean merchants.
 " But what about 1992 ?  They destroyed innocent people.
I was glad for them . At least they got something back , OK.
 " But I wish that , I wish that , I wish that I could be part of the enjoyment.
Igniting , igniting , igniting fire . Igniting fire.
And I told you that in -- you know , I didn ' t give you the year , but in  ' 79 I thought that I was going to go around and find bull riders and pig farmers and people like that , and I got sidetracked on race relations.
He ' s a Republican -- I won ' t say anything about my party affiliation , but anyway -- so this is my dear , dear Brent Williams , and this is on toughness , in case anybody needs to know about being tough for the work that you do . I think there ' s a real lesson in this.
It seems like he has so much bad luck , you know.
I was in a doctor ' s office last CAT scan , and there was a Reader ' s Digest , October 2002.
You ' re not even going to be able to answer her questions. '  And she was saying you ' re going to make me look like an idiot because I ' ve never been to college , and I wouldn ' t be talking professional or anything.

 " Freedom ?  It would have to be the rodeo.
It ' s like , you know , racking up our credit cards on entry fees and gas.
I mean , I guess it just be like -- I guess it be like the day my brother died.
And then they had to straighten out my nose , and they took these rods and shoved them up my nose and went up through my brains and felt like it was coming out the top of my head , and everybody said that it should have killed me , but it didn ' t , because I guess I have a high tolerance for pain.

Chris Anderson : Wow.
advertising,culture,entertainment,media,social media
Let me connect the dots.
Now most media companies -- television , radio , publishing , games , you name it -- they use very rigid segmentation methods in order to understand their audiences.
And so the bizarre result of this is that most of our popular culture is actually based on these presumptions about our demographics.
Now , if you watch  " Mad Men, "  like I do -- it ' s a popular TV show in the States -- Dr . Faye Miller does something called psychographics , which first came about in the 1960s , where you create these complex psychological profiles of consumers.
And in the last three years , we ' ve been looking specifically at social media to see what has changed , and we ' ve discovered some very interesting things.
And we can lie about our age online , too , pretty easily.
They know this is the mass audience of the future ; they need to figure it out.
But they get a lot more information about what you do online , what you like , what interests you.
It had been presumed before.
That would tell me something more substantial about you.
And then if you look at the amount of time that they spend on these sites , they truly dominate the social media space , which is a space that ' s having a huge impact on old media.
Will the next big-budget blockbuster movies actually be chick flicks ? 
But I think women are actually going to be -- ironically enough -- responsible for driving a stake through the heart of cheesy genre categories like the  " chick flick "  and all these other genre categories that presume that certain demographic groups like certain things -- that Hispanics like certain things , that young people like certain things.
Why should I know this ? 
I ' ve spent most of my professional life researching media and entertainment and its impact on people ' s lives.
Can you even imagine what that looks like ? 
 " Bonk "  author Mary Roach delves into obscure scientific research , some of it centuries old , to make 10 surprising claims about sexual climax , ranging from the bizarre to the hilarious.

And the orgasm reflex can be triggered by a surprisingly broad range of input.
There is such a thing as a knee orgasm in the literature.
He checked to see if it was something in the toothpaste , but no -- it happened with any brand.
Sadly she -- this is what it said in the journal paper --  " She believed that she was possessed by demons and switched to mouthwash for her oral care. " 
You gotta love that . Rutgers.
But afterwards she was kind enough to demonstrate on a bench outside.
She said that the last time she had done it was on the Disneyland tram.
Now this is somebody who is brain-dead , legally dead , definitely checked out , but is being kept alive on a respirator , so that their organs will be oxygenated for transplantation.
It ' s like this . You trigger the spot.
I asked this question to a brain death expert , Stephanie Mann , who was foolish enough to return my emails.
But it would be an orgasm -- nonetheless.
I said ,  " You should actually do this. " 
This is a guy writing a book ,  " Ideal Marriage, "  you know.
Okay . In 1999 , in the state of Israel , a man began hiccupping.
Days went by . At a certain point , the man , still hiccupping , had sex with his wife.
I love that because there is like a whole demographic : unattached hiccuppers.
If you go all the way back to Hippocrates , physicians believed that orgasm in women was not just helpful for conception , but necessary.
He had this line in his book that supposedly comes from the Habsburg Monarchy , where there was an empress Maria Theresa , who was having trouble conceiving.
Masters and Johnson were upsuck skeptics , which is also really fun to say.
And in the artificial semen was a radio-opaque substance , such that it would show up on an X-ray.
And Masters and Johnson looked to see if the semen was being sucked up.
You can use flour and water , or cornstarch and water.
There ' s another way that orgasm might boost fertility.
He said ,  " If I keep tossing myself off I get fresh sperm being made. " 
Alrighty . There is considerable evidence for upsuck in the animal kingdom -- pigs , for instance.
And I got a copy of this DVD.
It all looks very innocent.
You should know , the clitoris of the pig , inside the vagina.
There is a point in this video , towards the beginning where they zoom in for a close up of his hand with his wedding ring , as if to say ,  " It ' s okay , it ' s just his job . He really does like women. " 
That ' s not one of your five steps. " 
Shy but ambitious pig farmers , however , can purchase a -- this is true -- a sow vibrator , that hangs on the sperm feeder tube to vibrate.
And she said , you can ' t make that conclusion , because animals don ' t register pain or pleasure on their faces in the same way that we do.
Primates , on the other hand , we use our mouths more.
Okay , with women , a lot of this is happening inside.
There is a phallus , clear acrylic phallus , with a camera and a light source , attached to a motor that is kind of going like this.
This just kills me , not because I wanted to use it -- I wanted to see it.
Kinsey thought it was bunk , so he got to work.
However , the record holder landed just shy of the eight-foot mark , which is impressive.
Which is my second favorite line in the entire oeuvre of Alfred Kinsey.

JD Schramm : Break the silence for suicide attempt survivors
And yet , despite everything going really well for John , he was struggling , fighting addiction and a gripping depression.
And that ' s actually where our story begins.
This truly is an at-risk population with very few resources to support them.
And this is , today , the first time in any sort of public setting I ' ve ever acknowledged the journey that I have been on.
And I ' m choosing to come out of a totally different kind of closet today to encourage you , to urge you , that if you are someone who has contemplated or attempted suicide , or you know somebody who has , talk about it ; get help.
culture,demo,entertainment
And I think that ' s true.
And believe me , I lived the same sad life until about three years ago.
He took a look and said ,  " Oh , you ' re tying them wrong. " 
Now as it turns out -- thank you.
If you pull the strands at the base of the knot , you will see that the bow will orient itself down the long axis of the shoe.
And if you pull the cords under the knot , you will see that the bow orients itself along the transverse axis of the shoe.
Start as usual , go the other way around the loop.
Now , in keeping with today ' s theme , I ' d like to point out -- and something you already know -- that sometimes a small advantage someplace in life can yield tremendous results someplace else.
art,arts,design,entertainment,humor,performance
First of all -- any questions so far ? 
Because I ' m from Switzerland , and I just don ' t hope you think this is Swiss German I ' m speaking now here . This is just what it sounds like if we Swiss try to speak American.
So I ' ve been asked by the organizers to read from my book.
I ' d like to show them around so we can just , you know -- Actually , I managed to prepare for you some enlarged pictures -- even better.
Yeah , I kind of felt sorry for him.
And it was great . With this experience , I started to look more closely at modern art . Then I realized how , you know , the world of modern art is particularly topsy-turvy.
And we can see here very clearly , it ' s a confusion of color.
We can see here he started out with orange , and then he already ran out of orange , and here we can see he decided to take a break for a square.
So I mean , that ' s just tidying up for beginners.
If my room back home had looked like this , my mother would have grounded me for three days.
We Swiss are famous for chocolate and cheese . Our trains run on time.
And yeah , we can see the artist has drawn a few lines and shapes and dropped them any old way onto a yellow background.
With this method Mr . Miro could have saved canvas for another picture.
 " Laut den Kunstprüfer Dr . Albrecht -- "  It ' s not finished yet.
I just realized it ' s important how one introduces new ideas to people , that ' s why these patents are sometimes necessary.
The right hand is the one we write with , apart from the left-handers.
So we can also see that very clearly in this next painting.
Yeah , it ' s a -- this one here , that ' s much better.
It ' s called  " Untitled "  and I think that ' s appropriate.
Or here , for example , we have 27 pink squares with only one pink curve.
For example , with the Keith Haring circles and Kandinsky ' s dots.
Yeah , from my own experience . So I ' m -- Actually , I mean , here we have some artists that are a bit more structured . It ' s not too bad.
And here , that ' s one of my favorites.
So once I had the opportunity to stay in a ritzy , five-star hotel.
Like books , clothes , toothbrush , etc . And it was great.
And when I returned it looked like this.
Yeah ?  I would actually prefer to do it more this way.
So now I ' ve been able to tidy up pictures that I ' ve wanted to tidy up for a long time.
Or you could go into three-dimensional art.
The pointillist movement is that kind of paintings where everything is broken down into dots and pixels.
You can count them afterwards , if you like.
But to round things up I would like to show you just one more.
Of course , they ' re not gone . They ' re all here.
And I ' m happy to sign it for you with any name of any artist.
And then maybe before I leave you ...
http://www.ted.com/talks/david_hanson_robots_that_relate_to_you.html
David Hanson : Robots that  " show emotion " 
I developed a series of technologies that allowed the robots to make more realistic facial expressions than previously achieved , on lower power , which enabled the walking biped robots , the first androids.
There he ' s starting to walk.
We ' re working with the Machine Perception Laboratory at the U.C . San Diego.
And here is a little bit of the technology that ' s involved in that.
And this is really heavily backlit.
So his perception of your emotional states is very important for machines to effectively become empathetic.
Character robotics could plant the seed for robots that actually have empathy.
This is one of our robots that we showed at Wired NextFest a couple of years ago.
You start to believe that it ' s alive and aware.
So we put his writings , letters , his interviews , correspondences , into a huge database of thousands of pages , and then used some natural language processing to allow you to actually have a conversation with him.
We specked it out to actually be doable with a very , very low-cost bill of materials , so that it can become a childhood companion for kids.
http://www.ted.com/talks/sebastian_wernicke_1000_tedtalks_6_words.html
Sebastian Wernicke : 1000 TEDTalks , 6 words
Because if you think about it , 1,000 TEDTalks , that ' s over 1,000 ideas worth spreading.
The damage to the economy for each one who does this is around $15,000.
Each of those TEDTalks has an average length of about 2,300 words.
I mean , if you have an idea worth spreading , surely you can put it into something shorter than 2,300 words.
And I also encountered a project called Six-Word Memoirs where people were asked , take your whole life and please sum this up into six words , such as these here :  " Found true love , married someone else. " 
We could have been done by lunch here.
So I started asking all my friends , please take your favorite TEDTalk and put that into six words.
Or some even included references to the speakers , such as Nathan Myhrvold ' s speaking style , or the one of Tim Ferriss , which might be considered a bit strenuous at times.
And I didn ' t allow any low-cost countries to work on this , but I found out I could get a six-word summary for just 10 cents , which I think is a pretty good price.
So I thought of a different way by thinking , well , the talks revolve around certain themes.
Now some of you might actually right now be thinking , It ' s downright crazy to have 10 TEDTalks summarized into just six words.
He always proves us wrong.
There were others , and I found this quite cheeky.
But , oh well . In the end , however , and this is really amazing , for each of those 10 TEDTalk clusters that I submitted , I actually received meaningful summaries.
So here I was.
So I thought , I probably have to take this one step further here and create summaries of the summaries -- and this is exactly what I did.
But in the end , amazingly , again , people were able to do it.
Now I had my nine groups , but , I mean , it ' s already quite a reduction.
And I would only pay $99.50 -- so stay even below a hundred dollars for it.
Because I think you ' ll agree , they all summarize some aspect of TED , but to me they felt a bit bland , or they just had a certain aspect of TED in them.
Peter Molyneux demos Milo , a hotly anticipated video game for Microsoft ' s Kinect controller . Perceptive and impressionable like a real 11-year-old , the virtual boy watches , listens and learns -- recognizing and responding to you.
When I saw a piece of technology called Kinect -- it was called Natal -- I was inspired , and I thought for a moment , maybe it ' s possible to address that one problem of storytelling , to create a character which seemed alive , which noticed me , that could look me in the eyes and feel real , and sculpt a story about our relationship.
And so I waited till now to have an actual demo of the real tech.
So why don ' t we go over and have a look at the demo now.
There are no controllers , no keyboards , or mice , or joysticks , or joypads.
We had to give him a problem because when we first created Milo , we realized that he came across as a little bit of a brat , to be honest with you.
His parents are too busy to listen to his problems , and that ' s when he starts almost conjuring you up.
That means no two people ' s Milos can be the same.
Very simple at the start.
We have complete control over his blush responses , the diameter of his nostrils to denote stress.
The other thing to use is your body.
He ' s now going to use the other thing which is essential , and that ' s his voice.
So we ' ve tackled that problem , and we ' ve come up with a solution , which we ' ll see in a second.
Do you want Milo to squash it ? 
Now look at his response.
We ' ve got a database of words which we recognize.
And we ' ll do that in a second.
We ' re actually teaching him.
How do you skim stones ? 
Again , all of this is done in the way us humans do things , and that ' s crucially important if we want Milo to appear real.
PM : That ' s Dimitri at his most competitive.
Basically -- the bit that we missed at the start -- his parents had asked him to clean up his room.
Now , to do that , we needed a set up , like a magician ' s trick.
Milo ' s Mom : That carpet is brand new.
It ' s all been too much for him.
Dimitri : Come on , Milo . You know what parents are like.
Dimitri : Well , you ' ve got a new school to go to.
You ' ve got a cool garden to play in and a pond.
PM : So after three-quarters of an hour , he recognizes you.
Some of those adventures are wonderfully encouraging -- he ' s got to go to school.
He ' ll recognize more objects and thus understand more words.
Biologist Mark Pagel shares an intriguing theory about why humans evolved our complex system of language . He suggests that language is a piece of  " social technology "  that allowed early human tribes to access a powerful new tool : cooperation.
Each of you possesses the most powerful , dangerous and subversive trait that natural selection has ever devised.
It ' s just that , whereas that device relies on pulses of infrared light , your language relies on pulses , discrete pulses , of sound.
Now language ' s subversive power has been recognized throughout the ages in censorship , in books you can ' t read , phrases you can ' t use and words you can ' t say.
And this leads to the wonderful irony that our languages exist to prevent us from communicating.
And that is how and why did this remarkable trait evolve , and why did it evolve only in our species ? 
And if they really were intelligent , why would they crack open nuts with a rock ? 
They seem to lack the ability to learn from others by copying or imitating or simply watching.
Now this may sound arrogant , or even full of hubris.
But if we look at the fossil record , we see that they made the same hand axe over and over and over again for one million years.
Sure enough , their tools were more complicated than those of Homo erectus , but they too showed very little change over the 300,000 years or so that those species , the Neanderthals , lived in Eurasia.
We can learn by watching other people and copying or imitating what they can do.
And as a result , our ideas do accumulate , and our technology progresses.
The chairs you ' re sitting in , the lights in this auditorium , my microphone , the iPads and iPods that you carry around with you -- all are a result of cumulative cultural adaptation.
But in fact , it turns out that some time around 200,000 years ago , when our species first arose and acquired social learning , that this was really the beginning of our story , not the end of our story.
If I can learn by watching you , I can steal your best ideas , and I can benefit from your efforts , without having to put in the time and energy that you did into developing them.
And so some time around 200,000 years ago , our species confronted this crisis.
Had we chosen this option , sometime around 200,000 years ago , we would probably still be living like the Neanderthals were when we first entered Europe 40,000 years ago.
The other option we could choose was to develop the systems of communication that would allow us to share ideas and to cooperate amongst others.
Language is a piece of social technology for enhancing the benefits of cooperation -- for reaching agreements , for striking deals and for coordinating our activities.
And to see why , consider two scenarios from early in our evolution.
And let ' s pretend the other one is good at language skills.
A scuffle ensues and you get stabbed with one of your own arrowheads.
We ' ll do that. " 
That ' s why we build space shuttles and cathedrals while the rest of the world sticks sticks into the ground to extract termites.
But when our species arose about 200,000 years ago , sometime after that we quickly walked out of Africa and spread around the entire world , occupying nearly every habitat on Earth.
It is the most valuable trait we have for converting new lands and resources into more people and their genes that natural selection has ever devised.
Currently , there are about seven or 8,000 different languages spoken on Earth.
If we go to the island of Papua New Guinea , we can find about 800 to 1,000 distinct human languages , different human languages , spoken on that island alone.
They ' re far closer together than that. " 
And we know this because when we study different language groups and associate them with their cultures , we see that different languages slow the flow of ideas between groups.
Now we have to counter that , though , against the evidence we ' ve heard that we might have had some rather distasteful genetic dalliances with the Neanderthals and the Denisovans.
And when you plot those friendship links by their latitude and longitude , it literally draws a map of the world.
And they impose a barrier to cooperation.
Now think of the absurdity of this situation.
And so if language really is the solution to the crisis of visual theft , if language really is the conduit of our cooperation , the technology that our species derived to promote the free flow and exchange of ideas , in our modern world , we confront a question.
And we see this in the inexorable march towards standardization.
And you can probably think of many , many more in your own everyday lives.
Matt Ridley : Mark , one question.
So many of you will be familiar with the idea that there ' s this gene called FOXP2 that seems to be implicated in some ways in the fine motor control that ' s associated with language.
What we know about this FOXP2 and Neanderthals is that they may have had fine motor control of their mouths -- who knows.
Sheryl WuDunn ' s book  " Half the Sky "  investigates the oppression of women globally . Her stories shock . Only when women in developing countries have equal access to education and economic opportunity will we be using all our human resources.
The global challenge that I want to talk to you about today rarely makes the front pages.
So , let ' s start off in China.
Many of you have been there . It ' s not the real China.
She lives with her parents , her two brothers and her great-aunt.
You ' re going to be spending the rest of your life in the rice paddies.
She still made the two-hour trek to the schoolhouse and tried to catch every little bit of information that seeped out of the doors.
He was delighted.
She went to high school.
She sent money back to her family.
And over the years , as we followed Dai Manju , we were able to see that she was able to move out of a vicious cycle and into a virtuous cycle.
And that brings me to my first major of two tenets of  " Half the Sky. " 
The cause of our time is the brutality that so many people face around the world because of their gender.
How many of you think there are more males or more females in the world ? 
Okay , most of you.
In fact , demographers have shown that there are anywhere between 60 million and 100 million missing females in the current population.
Girls get aborted before they ' re even born when there are scarce resources.
In India , in the first year of life , from zero to one , boy and girl babies basically survive at the same rate because they depend upon the breast , and the breast shows no son preference.
There are three reasons why this is the case.
The second reason is it has to do with spending.
If you just take four percentage points and put it into this basket , you would have a transformative effect.
Bill Gates put it very well when he was traveling through Saudi Arabia.
And someone from this side of the room got up and said ,  " Mr . Gates , we have here as our goal in Saudi Arabia to be one of the top 10 countries when it comes to technology.
So what would some of the specific challenges look like ? 
Now , modern slavery : according to State Department rough statistics , there are about 800,000 -- 10 times the number -- that are trafficked across international borders.
But you know , there is progress being made in places like Cambodia and Thailand.
In Niger , one in seven women can expect to die during childbirth.
And the most devastating injury is obstetric fistula.
She was married against her will at age 13.
In a word , she stank.
That night , there was a stick in the hut.
The foreign missionary opened the door , knew exactly what had happened , took her to a nearby fistula hospital in Addis Ababa , and she was repaired with a 350-dollar operation.
She ' s moved out of a vicious cycle and into a virtuous cycle.
With economic opportunity , it can be transformative.
She was beaten every single day by her husband , who was unemployed.
This is when she had her second daughter.
And when she couldn ' t produce enough , she hired other women in the village.
He does the transportation and distribution , and she does the production and sourcing.
Let me tell you about Beatrice Biira.
She ' s going to spend most of her life lugging water back and forth. " 
One of them ended up with Beatrice ' s parents , and that goat had twins.
So at nine years of age , Beatrice started in first grade -- after all , she ' d never been to a lick of school -- with a six year-old.
Two years ago , she graduated from Connecticut College.
But I want to give you a reality check.
You know , the criticism is fair ; it isn ' t easy.
Turns out that it ' s a failed irrigation project.
You learn from your mistakes , and you continuously improve.
You ' re probably asking that . Why should you care ? 
And the second thing , it ' s an anecdote that I ' ll leave you with.
She never broke down.
And she realized that she had the great fortune to be born in a country where we take security for granted , where we not only can feed , clothe and house ourselves , but also provide for wild birds so they don ' t go hungry in the winter.
So , here ' s the cause.
http://www.ted.com/talks/david_keith_s_surprising_ideas_on_climate_change.html
David Keith ' s unusual climate change idea
What ' s unusual about this one , maybe , is that it ' s from 1953.
We ' ve known about this problem for 50 years , depending on how you count it.
You ' ve seen this in various forms , but maybe you haven ' t seen this one.
But in fact , they ' re growing faster.
No , no! In terms of what we really need to do to put the brakes on this very high inertial thing -- our big economy -- we ' ve really hardly started.
Cheap meaning sort of the cost of the military , not the cost of medical care.
And we could do that by perfectly sensible things like conservation , and wind power , nuclear power and coal to CO2 capture , which are all things that are ready for giant scale deployment , and work.
What I ' m going to talk to you about tonight is stuff we might do if we did nothing.
But one of the reasons it ' s politically hard is there are winners and losers -- not all losers.
And there ' s no adaption.
And I know for certain that that will work.
Here ' s Mount Pinatubo in the early  ' 90s . That put a whole bunch of sulfur in the stratosphere with a sort of atomic bomb-like cloud.
But you ' ll notice that in the upper bar , which is the lower atmosphere and the surface , it cools down because we shielded the atmosphere a little bit.
And one other thing : it ' s fast.
But if you do this , it ' s quick.
And the answer seems to be yes.
And this graph from Ken Caldeira . It ' s important to say came , because Ken -- at a meeting that I believe Marty Hoffart was also at in the mid- ' 90s -- Ken and I stood up at the back of the meeting and said ,  " Geo-engineering won ' t work. " 
This topic is also old.
I ' m not saying we shouldn ' t cut emissions.
So I should say , I guess , that since the time of that original President Johnson report , and the various reports of the U.S . National Academy -- 1977 , 1982 , 1990 -- people always talked about this idea.
But in the last year , Paul Crutzen published this essay saying roughly what ' s all been said before : that maybe , given our very slow rate of progress in solving this problem and the uncertain impacts , we should think about things like this.
And in fact , he had some ideas to make them go away.
One of the problems with sulfates is they fall out quickly.
But then I found out that there were all sorts of papers already published that addressed this topic because it happens already in the natural atmosphere.
But let ' s say you have sunlight hitting some particle and it ' s unevenly heated.
That ' s called the photophoretic force.
We can move things out of the stratosphere into the mesosphere , in principle solving the ozone problem.
This is a new idea that ' s crept up that may be , essentially , a cleverer idea than putting sulfates in.
This improved science and engineering will , whether we like it or not , give us more and more leverage to affect the planet , to control the planet , to give us weather and climate control -- not because we plan it , not because we want it , just because science delivers it to us bit by bit , with better knowledge of the way the system works and better engineering tools to effect it.
One knob is the knob for controlling global temperature.
We have no global governance.
The scientists and engineers of the world are building it piece by piece , in their labs.
They develop science that makes it easier and easier to do.
But what we need is not just a few oddballs like me thinking about this.
I guess the thing I haven ' t said about this is , it is absurdly cheap.
I ' ll tell you how big the lever is : the lever is that big.
I don ' t think anybody takes that seriously.
But here ' s a case which is harder to reject.
So let ' s say that we work hard , and we actually don ' t just tap the brakes , but we step hard on the brakes and really reduce emissions and eventually reduce concentrations.
That ' s an absolutely possible scenario.
It ' s saying that you do some geo-engineering for a little while to take the worst of the heat off , not that you ' d use it as a substitute for action.
And that ' s one of the fundamental reasons that this problem is so hard to talk about , and , in general , I think it ' s the underlying reason that it ' s been politically unacceptable to talk about this.
Should we have a national research program that looks at this ? 
Many of us -- maybe now me -- think we should do that.
Another thing is , maybe we need a treaty.
And we ' ll have no international mechanism to figure out who makes the decision.
And it ' s time to begin thinking about it , even if the reason we ' re thinking about it is to construct arguments for why we shouldn ' t do it.

And oddly , the most notable letter of rejection I ever received came from Walt Disney World , a seemingly innocuous site.
But there are multiple truths attached to every image , depending on the creator ' s intention , the viewer and the context in which it is presented.
And I wanted to see the center with my own eyes , but what I came away with is a photograph.
It ' s titled ,  " An American Index of the Hidden and Unfamiliar, "  and it ' s comprised of nearly 70 images.
And I found one section amongst all of these that actually resembled the outline of the United States of America , which you can see here.
And what I ' m most interested in is the invisible space between a text and its accompanying image , and how the image is transformed by the text and the text by the image.
This is a cryopreservation unit , and it holds the bodies of the wife and mother of cryonics pioneer Robert Ettinger , who hoped to be awoken one day to extended life in good health , with advancements in science and technology , all for the cost of 35 thousand dollars , for forever.
This is a jury simulation deliberation room , and you can see beyond that two-way mirror jury advisers standing in a room behind the mirror.
On that table you can see 48 hours '  worth of seized goods from passengers entering in to the United States.
And in this I really wanted it to resemble an early still-life painting , so I spent some time with the smells and items.
And one of the art forms that elicited the interest of the agency , and had thus come under question , is abstract expressionism.
It ' s a research crop marijuana grow room.
This one is almost humorous because it feels like I could just snip all of that conversation in one easy cut.
And Playboy is always in the top few.
And the Air Armament Center at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida is responsible for the deployment and testing of all air-delivered weaponry coming from the United States.
Meaning white fur , ice blue eyes , a pink nose.
Kenny was born . He actually made it to adulthood.
And it ' s shown here in its true orientation.
In the context of the film , this is a deep-space battle station of the Galactic Empire , capable of annihilating planets and civilizations , and in reality it measures about four feet by two feet.
It ' s called the World Church of God.
And we put that wall around the World Church of God , and also used the characters and vehicles and explosions that are offered in the video games for the army.
It runs 24 hours a day , commercial free.
It ' s titled  " The Innocents. " 
I investigate photography ' s ability to blur truth and fiction , and its influence on memory , which can lead to severe , even lethal consequences.
I ' ll give you an example from a case.
And a positive identification is made because the photograph replaced the memory , if there ever was an actual memory.
And he served 10 years of a life sentence.
He served 18 years of a death sentence.
And here , the scene of the crime , it ' s this place to which he ' s never been , but changed his life forever.
Larry Mayes , I photographed at the scene of arrest , where he hid between two mattresses in Gary , Indiana , in this very room to hide from the police.
He is photographed at his alibi location.
Ronald Jones served eight years of a death sentence for rape and murder of a 28-year-old woman.
Timothy Durham , who I photographed at his alibi location where 11 witnesses placed him at the time of the crime , was convicted of 3.5 years of a 3220 year sentence , for several charges of rape and robbery.
Troy ' s picture was in a photo array that the victim tentatively had some draw toward , but said he looked too old.
That ' s it . Thank you.

My first point is that the pursuit of happiness is obligatory.
Well , we certainly try.
Prozac was really the first absolute blockbuster drug.
One problem that ' s happening now is , although the rates of happiness are about as flat as the surface of the moon , depression and anxiety are rising.
There is a rash of suicide in China.
For example , these two show great growth in income , absolutely flat happiness curves.
So the ultimate goal of psychoanalytic psychotherapy was really what Freud called ordinary misery.
The formula for a happy marriage is five positive remarks , or interactions , for every one negative.
We ' re wired for dangers that are immediate , that are physical , that are imminent , and so our body goes into an incredible reaction where endogenous opioids come in.
But unfortunately , we need this system in part.
And each one of them allows us to click into alternate selves that tune in , turn on , drop out thoughts , perceptions , feelings and memories.
We ' ve come away from the Freudian gloom , and people are now actively studying this.
And that happiness is a whole other end of the equation.
But somehow it was not put forward until very recently , seeing these as two parallel systems.
We use this word  " happy, "  and it ' s this very large umbrella of a term.
We are very sensitive to the negative , but it is in part offset by the fact that we have a positivity.
They like to look at beautiful faces rather than plain faces.
That ' s nonsense.
One is the reward system , and that ' s fed by the chemical dopamine.
In the 1950s , Olds and Milner put electrodes into the brain of a rat.
So they assumed this must be , you know , the brain ' s orgasmatron.
That ' s something different from the system that is the pleasure system , which simply says ,  " I like this. " 
And we see here the smile.
Extroverts use it more than introverts.
And we learn , of course , many , many pleasures , but many of them are base . And one of them , of course , is biophilia -- that we have a response to the natural world that ' s very profound.
And we imitate from almost the second we are born.
And even studies of cooperation show that cooperation between individuals lights up reward centers of the brain.
Because when you think about it , people are happiest when in flow , when they ' re absorbed in something out in the world , when they ' re with other people , when they ' re active , engaged in sports , focusing on a loved one , learning , having sex , whatever.
And being alone is very unnatural to the human.
So for example we have three systems that underlie reproduction , because it ' s so important.
And that ' s dopamine-fed . And that ' s ,  " I must have this one person. " 
The other way in which our genes can sometimes lead us astray is in social status.
Now , the human has a whole other way to rise to the top , and that is a prestige route , which is freely conferred.
But it ' s not irrelevant.
But the effect is relatively small.
 " Do you think the less-fortunate are having better sex ?  " 
Maslow had this idea back in the 1950s that as people rise above their biological needs , as the world becomes safer and we don ' t have to worry about basic needs being met -- our biological system , whatever motivates us , is being satisfied -- we can rise above them , to think beyond ourselves toward self-actualization or transcendence , and rise above the materialist.
Women had a whole different set of value shifts.
 " There is only one question : How to love this world ?  " 
Then do what you have to do. "

One was a passion for rodents.
Growing up in a multicultural environment , we had African students in the house , and I learned about their stories , so different backgrounds , dependency on imported know-how , goods , services , exuberant cultural diversity.
I quit my job to focus on the real world problem : landmines.
Actually , there was an appeal worldwide for new detectors in the sustainable environments where they ' re needed to produce , which is mainly in the developing world.
Well , actually rats are , in contrary to what most people think about them , rats are highly sociable creatures.
There , the animal finds a mine.
Very sustainable in this environment.
Rats have been used since the  ' 50s last century , in all kinds of experiments.
Now how do we communicate with rats ? 
Once the animal knows click , food , click , food , click , food -- so click is food -- we bring it in a cage with a hole , and actually the animal learns to stick the nose in the hole under which a target scent is placed , and to do that for five seconds -- five seconds , which is long for a rat.
In the next step , animals learn to find real mines in real minefields.
If the animal does that , it gets a license as an accredited animal to be operational in the field -- just like dogs , by the way.
They have a skill , which makes them much less dependent on foreign aid.
If you can bring in more rats , we can actually make the output even bigger.
But let me bring you to a very different problem.
In Tanzania -- the numbers don ' t lie -- 45 percent of people -- T.B . patients -- get diagnosed with T.B . before they die.
So in our common language , Dutch , the name for T.B.
This is how it works , and really , this is a generic technology.
You put these 10 samples at once in the cage.
It gets a click sound and comes for the food reward.
Can you imagine the potential offspring applications -- environmental detection of pollutants in soils , customs applications , detection of illicit goods in containers and so on.
And by just presenting the samples once more to the rats and looping those results back , we were able to increase case detection rates by over 30 percent.
At least our hero rats have saved lots of lives.
Also , to standardize the pellets , the food rewards , and to semi-automate this in order to replicate this on a much larger scale and affect the lives of many more people.
We don ' t have a working system here yet.
And to respectfully harmonize with them in order to foster a sustainable work.

Here is a lump of flesh , about three pounds , which you can hold in the palm of your hand.
It ' s the greatest mystery confronting human beings : How does this all come about ? 
And each neuron makes something like 1,000 to 10,000 contacts with other neurons in the brain.
This is what I spoke about in the last TED.
Now , it turns out there are neurons which are called ordinary motor command neurons in the front of the brain , which have been known for over 50 years.
These are called motor command neurons that have been known for a long time.
Because it ' s as though this neuron is adopting the other person ' s point of view.
Because to imitate a complex act requires my brain to adopt the other person ' s point of view.
So , how do you do imitation ?  Why is imitation important ? 
And that is , there is a sudden emergence and rapid spread of a number of skills that are unique to human beings like tool use , the use of fire , the use of shelters , and , of course , language , and the ability to read somebody else ' s mind and interpret that person ' s behavior.
So that when there was a sudden accidental discovery by one member of the group , say the use of fire , or a particular type of tool , instead of dying out , this spread rapidly , horizontally across the population , or was transmitted vertically , down the generations.
A human being , a child , can just watch its parent kill another polar bear , and skin it and put the skin on its body , fur on the body , and learn it in one step . What the polar bear took 100,000 years to learn , it can learn in five minutes , maybe 10 minutes.
And that is , there are mirror neurons , just as there are mirror neurons for action , there are mirror neurons for touch.
So , most of them will fire when I ' m touched in different locations . Different neurons for different locations.
I mean , I empathize with that person but I don ' t literally feel the touch.
But if you remove the arm , you simply anesthetize my arm , so you put an injection into my arm , anesthetize the brachial plexus , so the arm is numb , and there is no sensations coming in , if I now watch you being touched , I literally feel it in my hand.
All that ' s separating you from him , from the other person , is your skin.
You are , in fact , connected not just via Facebook and Internet , you ' re actually quite literally connected by your neurons.
It emerges from our understanding of basic neuroscience.
For the longest time people have regarded science and humanities as being distinct.
Pollen goes unnoticed by most of us , except when hay fever strikes . But microscopes reveal it comes in stunning colors and shapes -- and travels remarkably well . Jonathan Drori gives an up-close glimpse of these fascinating flecks of plant courtship.
Thank you . I have two missions here today.
It carries male sex cells from one flower to another.
Pollen is produced by the anthers of flowers.
Here is a scanning electron micrograph of a grain of pollen.
But not all pollen is quite so simple looking.
That little hole in the middle there is for the pollen tube , and when the pollen finds its special female spot in another Morina flower , just on the right species , what happens ? 
My story is actually not about plant propagation , but about pollen itself.
Now , pollen from plants , which are wind-dispersed -- like trees and grasses and so on -- tend to cause the most hay fever.
So , trees : very boring flowers , not really trying to attract insects.
Remember , that thing is just about 30 micrometers across.
Very showy , to attract lots of insects to do its bidding.
And I ' m rather proud to say that this was found just near London , and that 55 million years ago London was full of mangroves.
All these pictures were taken with a scanning electron microscope , actually in the lab at Kew Laboratories.
So , if you have a pollen sample , then in principle , you should be able to tell where that sample came from.
A different pollen signature , if you like , or a different pollen fingerprint.
Where has it been ? 
It ' s being used now to track where counterfeit drugs have been made , where banknotes have come from , to look at the provenance of antiques and see that they really did come from the place the seller said they did.
I hope I ' ve opened your eyes , if you ' ll excuse the visual pun , to some of pollen ' s secrets.
Thank you to the colleagues at Kew , and thank you to palynologists everywhere.

It ' s a closely held secret for reasons I don ' t know.
And as we have watched women conquer breast cancer through the breast cancer campaign , this is what we need to do now with heart.
If we were to remain sexist , and that was not right , but if we were going to go forward and be sexist , it ' s actually a woman ' s disease.
More and more women , two , three , four times more women , dying of heart disease than men.
Heart disease kills more women at all ages than breast cancer.
Now sometimes when people see this , I hear this gasp.
Heart disease kills people , often very quickly.
Betty Ford , Nancy Reagan stood up and said ,  " I ' m a breast cancer survivor, "  and it was okay to talk about it.
Women are living longer than ever.
As Barbara depicted in one of her amazing movies ,  " Yentl, "  she portrayed a young woman who wanted an education.
She had to look like a man.
Women are dying of heart disease , two , three , four times more than men.
Is it because women don ' t look like men , they don ' t look like that male-pattern heart disease that we ' ve spent the last 50 years understanding and getting really good diagnostics and really good therapeutics , and therefore , they ' re not recognized for their heart disease.
And this is the biggest biomedical enterprise research in the world.
And she started , in the face of a lot of controversy , the Women ' s Health Initiative.
It informed us about breast cancer , colon cancer in women.
Well there was a little piece of that Women ' s Health Initiative that went to National Heart , Lung , and Blood Institute , which is the cardiology part of the NIH.
So in the WISE , 15 years ago , we started out and said ,  " Well wow , there ' s a couple of key observations and we should probably follow up on that. " 
So I ' ll describe the male-pattern heart attack first.
There ' s a big clot in the middle of the artery.
So what do you think happens to these gals ? 
And we said ,  " We ' re going to hypothesize that the fatty plaque in women is actually probably different , and deposited differently , than men. " 
Where do women get fat ? 
Men just have to dump it in a single area. " 
He ' s got a beer belly in his coronary arteries.
So 50 years of honing and crafting these angiograms , we easily recognize male-pattern disease.
Well once again , women get the angiogram and nobody can tell that they have a problem.
So this is cardiac magnetic resonance imaging.
And we ' re about two and a half years into a five-year study.
The syndrome , the female-pattern now is called microvascular coronary dysfunction , or obstruction.
You can ' t go and order it yet , but this is an area of active inquiry where actually studying women is going to advance the field for women and men.
And when the woman has male-pattern disease -- so she looks like Barbara in the movie -- they get treated.
So those are the consequences.
If you ask , what is the big difference between women and men physiologically ? 
So we hypothesized that female stem cells might be better at identifying the injury , doing some cellular repair or even producing new organs , which is one of the things that we ' re trying to do with stem cell therapy.
And some of our investigative teams have demonstrated that female stem cells -- and this is in animals and increasingly we ' re showing this in humans -- that female stem cells , when put even into a male body , do better than male stem cells going into a male body.
And remember , paths crossed in 1984 , and more and more women were dying of cardiovascular disease.
So just like the breast cancer story , doing research , getting awareness going , it works , you just have to get it going.
So this is where we are , but we have a long row to hoe.
And we ' d like to think it ' s not going to take 35 years.
So what do we need to do ? 
And women do fundraising.
And it ' s political.
Breast cancer , as we said , kills women , but heart disease kills a whole bunch more.

I work in a lab where we take cells out of their native environment.
We observe the cells in a plate , and they ' re just on the surface.
Not only that , but they can also be used for disease models.
We call this the biomimetic paradigm -- copying nature in the lab.
We copy this in the lab by outfitting cell culture systems with electrodes.
Nature feeds the heart cells in your body with a very , very dense blood supply.
Let ' s see how powerful just one of these essentials can be.
You can see it in the upper left-hand corner.
But that brings me to lesson number two : cells do all the work.
Let ' s remind ourselves that cells are not an abstract concept.
But it ' s also worth noting that cells also mediate our experience of life.
May none of your non-cancer cells become endangered species.
Deb Roy : The birth of a word
And on this day , at this moment , we walked into the house with our first child , our beautiful baby boy.
Here ' s our living room , the baby bedroom , kitchen , dining room and the rest of the house.
So you ' re looking at a piece of what is by far the largest home video collection ever made.
And so with many privacy provisions put in place to protect everyone who was recorded in the data , we made elements of the data available to my trusted research team at MIT so we could start teasing apart patterns in this massive data set , trying to understand the influence of social environments on language acquisition.
And this has become part of our toolkit for being able to look and see where the activities are in the data , and with it , trace the pattern of , in particular , where my son moved throughout the home , so that we could focus our transcription efforts , all of the speech environment around my son -- all of the words that he heard from myself , my wife , our nanny , and over time , the words he began to produce.
I ' d like you to now experience the blossoming of a speech form.
No video here , so you can focus on the sound , the acoustics , of a new kind of trajectory : gaga to water.
Over the course of the 24 months , the first two years that we really focused on , this is a map of every word he learned in chronological order.
Why were certain words born before others ? 
And all of the data , we aligned based on the following idea : Every time my son would learn a word , we would trace back and look at all of the language he heard that contained that word.
So it appears that all three primary caregivers -- myself , my wife and our nanny -- were systematically and , I would think , subconsciously restructuring our language to meet him at the birth of a word and bring him gently into more complex language.
But that ' s looking at the speech context.
So welcome to my home.
That ' s me and my son on the floor.
And finally , my son playing in a walking toy by himself.
And we think that these affect the way language is learned.
He ' s leaving red ink behind.
DR : She offers water , and off go the two worms over to the kitchen to get water.
We call these wordscapes.
We can take the word  " bye "  as in  " good bye. " 
In my lab , which we ' re peering into now , at MIT -- this is at the media lab.
And Michael Fleischman was another Ph.D . student in my lab who worked with me on this home video analysis , and he made the following observation : that  " just the way that we ' re analyzing how language connects to events which provide common ground for language , that same idea we can take out of your home , Deb , and we can apply it to the world of public media. " 
And we ' re now , with satellite dishes , pulling and analyzing a good part of all the TV being watched in the United States.
And the same idea now can be built up.
Same concept , but looking at communication dynamics in a very different sphere.
And if you put them on one plain , a second plain is where the content lives.
And there are , again , now tens of millions of these links that give us the connective tissue of social graphs and how they relate to content.
And there are fascinating dynamics at play.
That drives tune-in behavior back into mass media , and you have these cycles that drive the overall behavior.
So a lot of people are following this person -- very influential -- and they have a propensity to talk about what ' s on TV.
A nation exploding in conversation in real time in response to what ' s on the broadcast.
It ' s like building a microscope or telescope and revealing new structures about our own behavior around communication.
And he was quiet for a moment.
And I thought ,  " Wow , this is powerful stuff. " 
It ' s a cluttered environment ; it ' s natural life.
About three steps in , he realizes something magic is happening , and the most amazing feedback loop of all kicks in , and he takes a breath in , and he whispers  " wow "  and instinctively I echo back the same.
Can you do it ? 
DR : Thank you.

David Sibbet from The Grove , and Kevin Richards , from Autodesk , made 650 sketches that strive to capture the essence of each presenter ' s ideas.
What is it about animation , graphics , illustrations , that create meaning ? 
The processing , of course , begins with the eyes.
As many as 30 other parts that selectively make more sense , create more meaning through the kind of  " Ah-ha "  experiences.
And this is the part of the brain that will recognize what something is.
A second part of the brain is called the dorsal stream.
You ' d be activating the dorsal stream if you did that.
It ' s the kind of gut center , where you see an image and you go ,  " Oh! I have a strong or emotional reaction to whatever I ' m seeing. " 
The brain processes this in parallel , the figments of information asking a whole bunch of questions to create a unified mental model.
Now we ' ve augmented this and spatialized this information.
It activates a different part of the brain.
The lessons for us are three-fold.
These are techniques that can be used to be -- that can be applied in a wide range of problem solving.
And it ' s very powerful because everyone gets to see everything else.
You ' ll be able to figure that out.
And this can be enhanced and augmented with some emerging digital technology.
So a team can actually look at all the key components that heat the structure and make choices and then see the end result that is visualized on this screen.
And then thirdly , making them persistent.
architecture,creativity,design,green,technology
I have a few pictures , and I ' ll talk a little bit about how I ' m able to do what I do.
This double front door here with the three-light transom that was headed to the landfill.
And these buttons there -- those are chicken eggs.
Even the lockset is probably worth 200 dollars.
I got that staircase for 20 dollars , including delivery to my lot.
And those are those cast-iron things you see at antique shops.
This is a bathtub I made , made out of scrap two-by-four here.
Then , this faucet here is just a piece of Osage Orange.
The barley hops design worked up into the eaves , then the dentil work comes directly off the can ' s red , white , blue and silver.
So we changed that and put ,  " This is the famous Budweiser house.
That ' ll keep bull elephants out , I promise.
Where do you get lumpy tiles ?  Well , of course , you don ' t.
We ' re getting tired of it . It ' s kind of cliched now.
But then if you put it in the front door , people say ,  " Oh , you ' re trying to be like those guys , and you didn ' t make it. " 
Don ' t put it in the foyer.
In order to do what I do , you have to understand what causes waste in the building industry.
What it means is , for every perception we have , it needs to tally with the one like it before , or we don ' t have continuity , and we become a little bit disoriented.
What you ' re doing is sizing up the pattern of structural features here , and then you go through your databanks -- brrrr , cell phone.
And you ' d have to start a new category , right between cell phones and chocolate.
Because that ' s what you do with a cracked pane.
Because Gestalt Psychology emphasizes recognition of pattern over parts that comprise a pattern.
If I have a hundred of these , a hundred of those , it doesn ' t make any difference what these and those are.
Second is , Friedrich Nietzsche along about 1885 wrote a book titled  " The Birth of Tragedy. " 
So the way the Apollonian personality takes a picture , or hangs a picture , is they ' ll get out a transit and a laser level and a micrometer.
The Dionysian personality takes the picture and goes ...
Dead-center John Dewey.
 " Oops "  this ,  " oops "  that .  " Landfill . Landfill . Landfill. " 
So now we have standardized materials.
And so if something isn ' t standard ,  " Oops , dumpster. "   " Oops "  this .  " Oops , warped. " 
The fourth thing is labor is disproportionately more expensive than materials.
 " Dan , I just don ' t think I ' m ready. " 
And the superintendent walked up and said ,  " What are you doing ?  " 
Do the math. " 
And that ' s what happened there.
The problem is we can ' t afford it.
You write the check , and instantly it depreciates 30 percent.
It out-gasses formaldehyde so much so that there is a federal law in place to warn new mobile home buyers of the formaldehyde atmosphere danger.
 " So I thought Palm Harbor Village was over there. " 
Now , all that , that Apollonian , Platonic model , is what the building industry is predicated on , and there are a number of things that exacerbate that.
Then here come the marketeers and the advertisers.
How disgusting.
My oh my , that makes it worse.
You can snap through it in maybe two years if you read eight hours a day.
I can wipe my mouth on my sleeve , napkin on the table , chew with my mouth open , make little noises , scratch wherever I want.
I feel that expectation , and so I accommodate it , and I ' m living my life according to what you expect me to do.
I ' ll bet all your shoes match.
The last thing is gregariousness.
Human beings are like that.
So along about September they can stride in and go ,  " I ' m important today.
See , I ' m one of the beautiful people . See my jeans ?  " 
On the bottom tier we have basic needs -- shelter , clothing , food , water , mating and so forth.
And so we end up with vain decisions and we can ' t even afford our mortgage.
That takes a little bit of nerve , and , darn it , once in a while you fail.
Everybody points and laughs , and they say ,  " He tried it a fifth time and it still didn ' t work.
And your instinct is to say ,  " Why don ' t you suck an egg ?  " 
And when I get a little bit of press , I hear from people all over the world.
And what we need to do is reconnect with those really primal parts of ourselves and make some decisions and say ,  " You know , I think I would like to put CDs across the wall there.
http://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_shows_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen.html
Hans Rosling shows the best stats you ' ve ever seen
And I put them together , so that in each pair of country , one has twice the child mortality of the other . And this means that it ' s much bigger a difference than the uncertainty of the data.
Because the chimpanzee would score half right if I gave them two bananas with Sri Lanka and Turkey . They would be right half of the cases.
We did this software which displays it like this : every bubble here is a country.
Well , I first discovered that the textbook was Tintin , mainly.
So this is what I could display here . I put fertility rate here : number of children per woman : one , two , three , four , up to about eight children per woman.
And these were the developing countries : they had large families and they had relatively short lives.
Or have they got longer lives and live up there ? 
Your yellow ones here are the Arabic countries , and they get larger families , but they -- no , longer life , but not larger families.
But now , Bangladesh -- it ' s a miracle that happens in the  ' 80s : the imams start to promote family planning.
And the United States up there is getting for longer life , keeping family size . And in the  ' 80s now , they give up communist planning and they go for market economy , and it moves faster even than social life . And today , we have in Vietnam the same life expectancy and the same family size here in Vietnam , 2003 , as in United States , 1974 , by the end of the war.
There ' s no gap between rich and poor any longer . This is a myth.
Where are the different countries ?  I can show you Africa.
And this is Latin America . It has everything on this Earth , from the poorest to the richest , in Latin America.
And the best projection from the World Bank is that this will happen , and we will not have a divided world . We ' ll have most people in the middle.
In some countries , 99.7 percent of children survive to five years of age ; others , only 70 . And here it seems there is a gap between OECD , Latin America , East Europe , East Asia , Arab states , South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.
And when it burst , the size of its country bubble is the size of the population.
Here in Uganda , development aid . Here , time to invest ; there , you can go for a holiday . It ' s a tremendous variation within Africa which we rarely often make -- that it ' s equal everything.
Yemen , civil war . United Arab Emirate , money which was quite equally and well used.
Today , we don ' t have to go to Cuba to find a healthy country in Latin America.
This is Mao Tse-tung . He brought health to China . And then he died.
I would like to compare South Korea , which is this one , with Brazil , which is this one . The label went away for me here . And I would like to compare Uganda , which is there . And I can run it forward , like this.
They came from here , a mineral country . They cached all the oil ; they got all the money ; but health cannot be bought at the supermarket.
In spite of falling oil prices , he brought this country up here.
The poorest are down there . If I split South Africa , it ' s like this.
And even more policy makers and the corporate sectors would like to see how the world is changing . Now , why doesn ' t this take place ? 
All that information we saw changing in the world does not include publicly-funded statistics . There are some web pages like this , you know , but they take some nourishment down from the databases , but people put prices on them , stupid passwords and boring statistics.
And it wasn ' t that difficult . It took some person years , and we have produced animations.
A search function where we can copy the data up to a searchable format and get it out in the world . And what do we hear when we go around ? 
The publicly-funded data is down here.
He only says ,  " We can ' t do it. " 
This is the income distribution of China , 1970.
Almost like a ghost , isn ' t it , huh ? 
It takes some time to change for this , but on the axises , you can quite easily get any variable you would like to have.
I end now with the world . There , the Internet is coming.
http://www.ted.com/talks/james_watson_on_how_he_discovered_dna.html
James Watson on how he discovered DNA
But it slightly bores me.
I was at the University of Chicago , in my third year , and I was in my third year because the University of Chicago let you in after two years of high school.
And by the age of 11 , I was no longer going to Sunday Mass , and going on birdwatching walks with my father.
And at the University of Chicago I was a zoology major , and thought I would end up , you know , if I was bright enough , maybe getting a Ph.D . from Cornell in ornithology.
And Schrodinger said the essence was information present in our chromosomes , and it had to be present on a molecule . I ' d never really thought of molecules before.
It wasn ' t a baseball player ; it was Linus Pauling.
And it was at Indiana I got the impression that , you know , the gene was likely to be DNA.
You can read it in about two hours.
Most people believed it was proteins.
So I wanted to work with him , but he didn ' t want a former birdwatcher , and I ended up in Cambridge , England.
And there I met Francis Crick.
But just ask what the molecule -- how should it fold up ? 
And certainly , neither Crick or I were chemists , so we tried to build a model . And he knew , Francis knew Wilkins.
The people from London came up.
And so we didn ' t build any models , and Francis sort of continued to work on proteins.
If DNA is that important , Linus will know it.
But there was ones in the literature.
And boy , I was scared because I thought , you know , we may be scooped.
So this was , you know , unexpected from the world ' s -- -- and so , it was held together by hydrogen bonds between phosphate groups.
And so Bragg said ,  " Build models. " 
And so I came back with that news to Cambridge , and Bragg said ,  " Build models. " 
And I think part of the reason she didn ' t want to build models was , she wasn ' t a chemist , whereas Pauling was a chemist.
We weren ' t the best chemists in the room.
He said they were wrong.
So it was a pretty , you know , it all happened in about two hours.
It ' s the order of the four bases.
But that ' s not the way most scientists think.
So think about it . The next five years , there were essentially something like five references to our work in  " Nature "  -- none.
It didn ' t yield . It didn ' t give good x-ray photographs.
But there is what we did when we didn ' t know where to go forward : we formed a club and called it the RNA Tie Club.
But that ' s the only -- no , we were only photographed twice.
And I ' m smiling , sort of forced , I think , because the girl I had , boy , she was gone.
And that let Marshall Nirenberg , you know , take RNA -- synthetic RNA -- put it in a system making protein . He made polyphenylalanine , polyphenylalanine . So that ' s the first cracking of the genetic code , and it was all over by 1966.
And -- but he knew patent law , and that we couldn ' t patent it , because you couldn ' t . No use for it.
And , boom , we ' ve , you know , had a biotech industry . And , but we were still a long ways from , you know , answering a question which sort of dominated my childhood , which is : How do you nature-nurture ? 
And what you can do is sort of compare DNA of normal segs versus cancer.
It ' s not a -- it ' s only a partial look , but it ' s a -- I think it ' s going to be very , very useful.
Which is , all of us have about 10 places in our genome where we ' ve lost a gene or gained another one.
And the reason we looked at autism is we had the money to do it.
So a lot of autistic kids are autistic because they just lost a big piece of DNA.
Now , so , our autism study is just beginning . We got three million dollars.
And so , I ' ll conclude by saying we ' ve looked at 20 people with schizophrenia.
Were they crazy also , and we didn ' t know it ? 
30 percent of schizophrenic people are left-handed , and schizophrenia has a very funny genetics , which means 60 percent of the people are genetically left-handed , but only half of it showed . I don ' t have the time to say.
And if I had enough money , we ' d find them all this year.

Everyone I met , I felt I knew them for as long as I could remember.
This is Los Angeles , California , where I live.
And the police are waiting for the fire department to arrive to cut apart the vehicle to extract the body of the driver.
I ' m put on full life support , and I have a massive stroke , and my brain drops into a coma.
It ' s essentially there ' s no sign of life from outside at all.
And the reason I think it would be so interesting to you is because consciousness is so interesting.
The show began with tremendous special effects , because there were catastrophic climate shifts -- which sort of sounds interesting as a parallel to today.
It ' s a cupule that took 40 to 50,000 blows with a stone tool to create , and it ' s the first known expression of art on the planet.
There ' s the Egyptian god Horus , which symbolizes prosperity , wisdom and health.
But we don ' t . We take our consciousness for granted.
These are just some examples.
Each one can entail up to a decade of rehabilitation , which means that India , unless something changes , is accumulating a need for millennia of rehabilitation.
The World Health Organization tells us that depression is the number one disease on Earth in terms of years lived with disability.
If you look at some of these other items -- concussions.
All of this is leading -- computer addiction , just to cover that : the most frequent thing we do is use digital devices.
And that then might lead you to watch an episode one day of Cedars-Sinai medical center and a consideration of the difference between potential mind and actual mind.
This is how I was when I returned from the hospital after nearly four months.
I felt empty and full , hot and cold , euphoric and depressed because the brain is the world ' s first fully functional quantum computer ; it can occupy multiple states at the same time.
Look into those eyes . I ' m not able to focus those eyes.
But let ' s take a look behind my eyes.
That is the consequence of more than a third of the right side of my brain being destroyed by the stroke.
I thought there were miraculous elements , but I also didn ' t think it was right that one should have to struggle and search for answers when this is a pandemic within our society.
Plasticity means that there was always hope for our reason -- hope for our ability to rebuild that function.
Here ' s what my neuropsychologist provided for me when I actually found somebody who could apply it.
And you can see here there are three columns.
That ' s when I was discharged from the system.
Then I underwent cognitive training.
Now the Journal of the National Medical Association gave my memoir a full clinical review , which is very unusual.
That was a fair question because my memoir was simply how I found solutions that worked for me.
And this person is particularly interesting.
Second aspect : I still had crushing migraine headaches.
Up to 30 percent of the population have a disorder , disease or dysfunction in the jaw that affects the entire body.
This affected my entire body.
That ' s why the same between the before and after that this shows , it ' s hard to see the difference.
Imagine the blood flowing through your body -- I was told at UCLA Medical Center -- as one sealed system.
If that some place else where it bulges is inside the biggest nerve in your body , your brain , you get a vascular migraine.
Using this technology , the specialists at UCLA Medical Center were able to identify where that compression in the hose pipe was occurring.
All consciousness is about communication.
I ' ve brought with me , from Southern California , the FM device.
Five of them would still weigh less than a rupee coin.
Here are the implantation sites.
And other FM devices implanted in fingertips , on contacting a surface , will send a message back to the sensory cortex of the brain , so that the person feels a sense of touch.
And in closing , I want to share the personal reason why this meant so much to me and changed the direction of my life.
And I whispered the good news through my broken jaw , which was wired shut , to my night nurse.
And as I discovered these threats to consciousness and how they are surrounding the world and enveloping the lives of more and more people every day , I discovered what truly remained.
You know , when I heard Simon ' s -- please sit down ; I just want to talk to him for a second -- when I read his book , I went to LA to meet him.
I didn ' t expect that person that I was going to meet to be him.
The thing that amazed me is the painstaking detail with which he has written every hospital he has been to , every treatment he got , every near-miss he had , and how accidentally he stumbled upon innovations.
And this records every single step I ' ve taken for , ooh , five or six years now.
And that ' s my friend . I mean , I charge it every night.
This down here , if the camera can see that , that is a small antenna.
And if you walk faster , if I walk faster , it detects what ' s called the time interval , which is the interval between each heel lift.
But there ' s millions of deaf people in the world , and the Cochlear implant has given hearing to thousands of deaf people now.
Because what I didn ' t say in my talk is this is actually exoskeletal.
Alfred Mann has set up this foundation to advance this research because he saw there ' s no way venture capital would come in for something like this.
He ' s a very , very remarkable man.
http://www.ted.com/talks/drew_curtis_how_i_beat_a_patent_troll.html
Drew Curtis : How I beat a patent troll
Take something already being done and patent it for an emerging technology -- like phone calls on the internet or video listings for TV shows or radio but for cellphones , and so on.
In the case of Gooseberry Natural Resources , this patent on emailing news releases had sort of a fatal flaw as it pertained to myself , and that was that in the mainstream media world there is only one definition for news release , and it turns out that is press release -- as in P.R.
One of the major problems with patent law is that , in the case that when you are sued by a patent troll , the burden of proof that you did not infringe on the patent is actually on the defendant , which means you have to prove that you do not infringe on the patent they ' re suing you on.
Now I had hoped to team up with some of these larger companies in order to defend against this lawsuit , but one-by-one they settled out of the case , even though -- and this is important -- none of these companies infringed on this patent -- not a one of them.
Six months into the lawsuit , we finally reached the discovery phase.
Never mind the fact that the address led to a strip mall somewhere in Northern L.A.
My response :  " How about nothing ? ! " 
Now , as mentioned before , one of the reasons I can talk to you about this is because there ' s no non-disclosure agreement on this case.
It came back signed.
First of all , if you can , don ' t fight the patent , fight the infringement.
Now the reason this works is because patent trolls are paid a percentage of what they ' re able to recover in settlements.
It turns out , because they ' re paid on contingency , it works really , really well in reverse.
Patent trolls have done more damage to the United States economy than any domestic or foreign terrorist organization in history every year.
And the problem with that is that there are two very large industry groups that have different outcomes in mind for the patent system.
And as a result , patent trolls can kind of live in the space in between.
Behold , patent infringement via mobile device -- defined as a computer which is not stationary.

My daddy , he calls me all the time. " 
At Camp Diva , my non-profit organization , we have these types of conversations all the time as a way to help girls of African descent prepare for their passage into womanhood.
They started dreaming about the decorations , invitations , the dresses they were going to wear , and what their fathers could and could not wear.
So we had a dance , and girls and their fathers came in multitudes.
They really enjoyed each other ' s company.
 " Why not ?  "  the girls asked.
That ' s worse than not having him here at all. " 
So the girls thought for a moment , and one girl suggested ,  " Why don ' t we just take the dance in the jail ?  " 
I said ,  " Girls , well , well , you never know unless you ask. " 
So , 16 inmates and 18 girls were invited.
They laughed together.
Even the guards cried.
This was going to be used as a touchstone so when they started to miss each other and feel disconnected , they could reconnect through this image.
I have had my father in my life always.
Because we know that the fathers are even leaving with this one thought : What type of woman am I preparing to put in the world ? 
disease,global issues,health,science
Actually , it ' s a really big idea.
This is a polio vaccine.
But it wasn ' t always that way.
And it was because of scenes like this.
This disease was terrifying.
It was hailed as a scientific miracle in the late 1950s.
And it happened so fast in the United States , however , that even just last month Jon Stewart said this : Jon Stewart : Where is polio still active ? 
We made this map for Jon to try to show him exactly where polio still exists.
It ' s been working for 20 years to try and eradicate this disease , and it ' s got it down to these few cases that you can see here on this graphic.
Hundreds of people died -- children as well as adults.
And not only that , but when they came into these countries , then they got on commercial jetliners probably and they traveled even farther to other places like Russia , where , for the first time in over a decade last year , children were crippled and paralyzed by a disease that they had not seen for years.
It ' s just happening in another part of the world.
We ' re not trying to get it down to just a few cases , because this disease is like a root fire ; it can explode again if you don ' t snuff it out completely.
This is one of the very few viruses in the world where there are big enough cracks in its armor that we can try to do something truly extraordinary.
And we ' ve got pretty good vaccines , as I ' ve just showed you.
It ' s been tried six times in the last century , and it ' s been successful exactly once.
And if we can finish polio eradication , the poorest countries in the world are going to save over 50 billion dollars in the next 25 years alone.
The first is that , when we started trying to eradicate polio about 20 years ago , more than twice as many countries were infected than had been when we started off with smallpox.
It deteriorates so quickly in the tropics that we ' ve had to put this special vaccine monitor on every single vial so that it will change very quickly when it ' s exposed to too much heat , and we can tell that it ' s not a good vaccine to use on a child -- it ' s not potent ; it ' s not going to protect them.
With polio it ' s almost completely different.
There ' s over 10 million people , probably 20 million people , largely volunteers , who have been working over the last 20 years in what has now been called the largest internationally-coordinated operation in peacetime.
But reaching 500 million people is much , much tougher.
One reporter who was watching our program in Somalia about five years ago -- a place which has eradicated polio , not once , but twice , because they got reinfected.
This is a group whose million-strong army of volunteers have been working to eradicate polio for over 20 years.
And in each of those , it was only part of the country.
Last year , it was 1,000.
But the most exciting thing that the polio eradication program has been doing has been to force us , the international community , to reach every single child , every single community , the most vulnerable people in the world , with the most basic of health services , irrespective of geography , poverty , culture and even conflict.
And then , in one of the most important , tenacious and toughest reservoirs of the polio virus in the world , we found that our vaccine was working half as well as it should have.
We should abandon this idea of eradication.
There ' s absolutely no question.
Umar also has polio.
But Umar is a fantastic student . He ' s an incredible kid.
Umar is an exceptional kid in exceptional circumstances.
We think children deserve better.
And now they ' ve even started using these devices -- speaking of cool technology -- these little devices , little GIS trackers like this , which they put into the vaccine carriers of their vaccinators.
We ' re working closely with the International Committee of the Red Cross to ensure that we can reach every child.
The new vaccine had twice the impact on these last couple of viruses as the old vaccine had , and we immediately started using this.
The first place this vaccine was used was in southern Afghanistan , because it ' s in places like that where kids are going to benefit the most from technologies like this.
Now remember , northern India is the perfect storm when it comes to polio.
Today marks exactly six months -- and for the first time in history , not a single child has been paralyzed in Uttar Pradesh or Bihar.
Ladies and gentlemen , with a combination of smart people , smart technology and smart investments , polio can now be eradicated anywhere.
The huge social movement that ' s been involved in polio eradication is ready to do way more for these children.
Now we ' re in tough times economically.
We have a new vaccine , we have new resolve , and we have new tactics.
Help us tell the story.
BA : The four places where you saw , that we ' ve never stopped -- northern Nigeria , northern India , the southern corner of Afghanistan and bordering areas of Pakistan -- they ' re going to be the toughest.
So the tough ones : going to get the top of Nigeria finished and getting Pakistan finished.
And is it easy to raise that money ? 
That ' s what it costs to reach 500 million children.
We have a big gap in that money . We ' re cutting corners , and every time we cut corners , more places get infected that shouldn ' t have , and it just slows us down.
Thank you.

Well today we ' re here to share with you a message that we have learned from a very important and special character -- this leopard.
And here ' s a prime example.
Now I ' m destined to spend a lot of time with some unique , very , very special , individualistic and often seductive female characters.
And early on , a lightning bolt hit a tree 20 paces away from us.
Well , we needn ' t have worried.
We called her Legadema , which means ,  " light from the sky. " 
BJ : But through our investigation , we have to seek the wildest places in Africa.
But we ' re really there seeking and searching and filming the iconic cats.
BJ : And then of course , the challenge is knowing when to turn around.
We actually managed to drown two million dollars '  worth of camera gear.
But all the places we get stuck in really have great views.
And surprisingly , it became a cult film.
But that ' s , I think , what this is all about , is that these individuals have these personalities and characters.
BJ : So , as Dereck says , we have to work through extremes -- extreme temperatures , push ourselves at night.
And I have to tell you that it was a disturbing night for me.
DJ : The amazing thing about these moments -- and this is probably a highlight of our career -- is that you never know how it ' s going to end.
But by the same token , you can get your hope back again.
Now back to the leopard.
Beverly sits on the one side where all her camera gear is , and I ' m on the other side where my space is.
But at the same time , we were concerned that if she created this as a habit and jumped into somebody else ' s car , it might not turn out the same way -- she might get shot for that.
DJ : It was the only way for me to save the marriage , because Beverly felt she was being replaced , you see.
It was like watching a graduation ceremony.
And of course , the baby baboon was so innocent , it didn ' t turn and run.
We realized that we actually don ' t know everything , and that nature is so unpredictable , we have to be open at all times.
She had this maternal instinct , much like a young girl on her way to womanhood , and so this really took us to this new level of understanding that personality.
It did die , and we suspect it was from the freezing winter nights.
And so we , with the National Geographic , formed the Big Cats Initiative to march forward into conservation , taking care of the big cats that we loved -- and then had an opportunity to look back over the last 50 years to see how well we had all collectively been doing.
Leopards have plummeted from 700,000 down to a mere 50,000.
It ' s simply not sustainable.
DJ : There ' s a burgeoning bone trade.
So the 20,000 lion figure that you just saw is actually a red herring , because there may be 3,000 or 4,000 male lions , and they all are actually infected with the same disease.
BJ : And you have to know that , when a male lion is killed , it completely disrupts the whole pride.
They ' re essential to the habitat.
If they disappear , all of that goes away.
That is the situation we ' re in -- the last lions.
We need it . We respect and celebrate each other as a man and a woman , as a community and as part of this planet , and we need to continue that.
http://www.ted.com/talks/richard_dawkins_on_our_queer_universe.html
Richard Dawkins : The universe is queerer than we can suppose
Richard Feynman compared the accuracy of quantum theories -- experimental predictions -- to specifying the width of North America to within one hair ' s breadth of accuracy.
David Deutsch , who ' s talking here , in  " The Fabric of Reality, "  embraces the  " many worlds "  interpretation of quantum theory , because the worst that you can say about it is that it ' s preposterously wasteful.
Every time you drink a glass of water , he points out , the odds are that you will imbibe at least one molecule that passed through the bladder of Oliver Cromwell.
What is it that makes us capable of supposing anything , and does this tell us anything about what we can suppose ? 
After all , it seems obvious that the Earth is large and motionless , the Sun small and mobile . But it ' s worth recalling Wittgenstein ' s remark on the subject.
Science has taught us , against all intuition , that apparently solid things , like crystals and rocks , are really almost entirely composed of empty space.
As an evolutionary biologist , I ' d say this : our brains have evolved to help us survive within the orders of magnitude of size and speed which our bodies operate at . We never evolved to navigate in the world of atoms.
We are evolved denizens of Middle World , and that limits what we are capable of imagining . We find it intuitively easy to grasp ideas like , when a rabbit moves at the sort of medium velocity at which rabbits and other Middle World objects move , and hits another Middle World object , like a rock , it knocks itself out.
He stood up , and moved out from behind his desk.
What is the wall mostly made of ?  Atoms.
I have every reason to think it ' s true ; I was reading Playboy because I , myself , had an article in it.
In the same way , our lives are dominated by gravity but are almost oblivious to the force of surface tension.
Victorians thought the waves had to be waves in some material medium : the ether . But we find real matter comforting only because we ' ve evolved to survive in Middle World , where matter is a useful fiction.
It ' s what ' s technically known as a  " barchan, "  and the entire dune walks across the desert in a westerly direction at a speed of about 17 meters per year.
He invites us , the reader , to  " think of an experience from your childhood -- something you remember clearly , something you can see , feel , maybe even smell , as if you were really there.
Not a single atom that is in your body today was there when that event took place . Matter flows from place to place and momentarily comes together to be you.
If a neutrino had a brain , which it evolved in neutrino-sized ancestors , it would say that rocks really do consist of empty space.
The nature of the model depends on the kind of animal we are.
A water strider ' s brain doesn ' t need 3D software at all , since it lives on the surface of the pond in an Edwin Abbott flatland.
Bats , I ' ve even suggested , use perceived hues , such as red and blue , as labels , internal labels , for some useful aspect of echoes -- perhaps the acoustic texture of surfaces , furry or smooth and so on , in the same way as swallows or , indeed , we , use those perceived hues -- redness and blueness etc . -- to label long and short wavelengths of light.
Dogs can distinguish two very similar fatty acids , extremely diluted : caprylic acid and caproic acid.
A dog that had never met capric acid would , perhaps , have no more trouble imagining its smell than we would have trouble imagining a trumpet , say , playing one note higher than we ' ve heard a trumpet play before.
Middle World is the narrow range of reality which we judge to be normal , as opposed to the queerness of the very small , the very large and the very fast.
Because there are so many of them , and because there ' s no agreement among them in their preferred direction of movement , the marble , as we see it in Middle World , stays rock steady.
In the vastness of astronomical space and geological time , that which seems impossible in Middle World might turn out to be inevitable.
Could make some sort of landmark points along a spectrum of improbability , which might look like the electromagnetic spectrum we just looked at.
I don ' t think we shall have to avail ourselves of that , because I suspect that life is quite common in the universe.
Could we , by training and practice , emancipate ourselves from Middle World and achieve some sort of intuitive , as well as mathematical , understanding of the very small and the very large ?  I genuinely don ' t know the answer.
Most scientists today subscribe to a mechanistic view of the mind : we ' re the way we are because our brains are wired up as they are ; our hormones are the way they are.
Or worse , we seek revenge , in all probability thereby triggering the next phase in an escalating cycle of counter-revenge , which we see , of course , all over the world today.
Treating people as machines may be scientifically and philosophically accurate , but it ' s a cumbersome waste of time if you want to guess what this person is going to do next.
Or are our brains so versatile and expandable that we can train ourselves to break out of the box of our evolution ?

One of my driving passions is this idea of exploring nature , and trying to find hidden data within nature.
And so this basically led me to a subject called cymatics.
Moving on from this , the next person to explore this field was a gentleman called Hans Jenny in the 1970s.
What we can see here is the metal sheet , this time connected to a sound driver and being fed by a frequency generator.
Well , for me cymatics is an almost magical tool.
And the list of scientific applications is growing every day.
This is an installation developed with school children , where their hands are tracked . It allows them to control and position cymatic patterns and the reflections that are caused by them.
This is Pink Floyd ' s  " Machine "  playing in real time through the cymascope.
Then on the right we can see a cymatically created snowflake.
Well , there is still a lot to explore in its early days . And there ' s not many people working in this field.
And think about the immense sound of the universe forming.
I want to urge everybody here to apply your passion , your knowledge and your skills to areas like cymatics.

And little Billy says ,  " My father plays the piano in an opium den. " 
But how can I tell an eight-year-old boy that his father is a politician ?  " 
All of them , however , including myself , as we walk underneath those strange stone gargoyles just down the road , feel that we ' ve become less than the sum of our parts , feel as though we have become profoundly diminished.
Ten years ago , however , the promise of democracy seemed to be extraordinary . George W . Bush stood up in his State of the Union address in 2003 and said that democracy was the force that would beat most of the ills of the world . He said , because democratic governments respect their own people and respect their neighbors , freedom will bring peace.
Well , what we ' ve seen is the creation , in places like Iraq and Afghanistan , of democratic systems of government which haven ' t had any of those side benefits.
And when I have conversations with people , I remember having a conversation , for example , in Iraq , with a community that asked me whether the riot we were seeing in front of us , this was a huge mob ransacking a provincial council building , was a sign of the new democracy.
Anything else would run contrary to our values , it would run contrary to the wishes of the people on the ground , it would run contrary to our interests.
What is wrong with the people that we have chosen ? 
Most remote community , I have never met a villager who does not want a vote.
Why should we get away from those arguments ? 
The point about democracy is not that it delivers legitimate , effective , prosperous rule of law.
But if we ' re really to make democracy vigorous again , if we ' re ready to revivify it , we need to get involved in a new project of the citizens and the politicians.
After I speak to you today , I ' m going on a radio program called  " Any Questions, "  and the thing you will have noticed about politicians on these kinds of radio programs is that they never , ever say that they don ' t know the answer to a question . It doesn ' t matter what it is.
And the second thing we should do is understand the genius of our societies.
In Britain , it could mean looking to the French , learning from the French , getting directly elected mayors in place in a French commune system.
For politicians to be honest , the public needs to allow them to be honest , and the media , which mediates between the politicians and the public , needs to allow those politicians to be honest.

Ethan Zuckerman : Listening to global voices
But the one that ' s really been sort of stressing me out , that I haven ' t been able to figure out , is this phrase  " Cala a boca , Galvao. " 
So I went onto Twitter , and I asked some people if they could explain to me  " Cala a boca , Galvao. " 
Narrator : A word about Galvao , a very rare kind of bird native to Brazil.
Some sick and twisted people have found themselves snorting Galvao.
And my Brazilian friends tell me that if I just tweet the phrase  " Cala a boca , Galvao, "  10 cents will be given to a global campaign to save this rare and beautiful bird.
And what I understand from my Brazilian friends is that this guy is just a cliche machine.
Now there ' s a couple -- there ' s a couple of lessons that you can take from this.
There ' s more than five million of them.
Now if you ' re using Twitter or other social networks , and you didn ' t realize this was a space with a lot of Brazilians in it , you ' re like most of us.
It ' s also extremely surprising to many Americans , a heavily African-American space.
That ' s about twice as high as African-Americans are represented in the population.
This was a visualization done by Fernando Viegas and Martin Wattenberg , two amazing visualization designers , who looked at a weekend ' s worth of Twitter traffic and essentially found that a lot of these trending topics were basically segregated conversations -- and in ways that you wouldn ' t expect.
But generally speaking , most of us don ' t.
If you go back into the early days of the internet , when cyber-utopians like Nick Negroponte were writing big books like  " Being Digital, "  the prediction was that the internet was going to be an incredibly powerful force to smooth out cultural differences , to put us all on a common field of one fashion or another.
And Negroponte says this is crazy.
It can be anywhere in the world at any time.
It turns out that in many cases atoms are much more mobile than bits.
It ' s extremely difficult for me to get Fijian news , which is strange , because actually there ' s an enormous amount going on in Fiji.
Here ' s what I think is going on.
It includes things like the Internet cables.
It ' s all right there.
There are parts of the world that are very , very well connected.
And you ' ll discover that there are parts of the globe that are systematically cut off.
It ' s getting more connected.
If you watched a television broadcast in the United States in the 1970s , 35 to 40 percent of it would have been international news on a nightly new broadcast.
Alisa ' s the president of Public Radio International.
And that ' s basically what our media is about.
Here ' s a map made by Mark Graham who ' s down the street at the Oxford Internet Institute.
In the U.K. , you can get up , you can pick up your computer when you get out of this session , you could read a newspaper from India or from Australia , from Canada , God forbid from the U.S.
So all of this starts leading me to think that we ' re in a state that I refer to as imaginary cosmopolitanism.
And we forget that most of the time we ' re checking Boston Red Sox scores.
For six years , I ' ve been hanging out with these guys.
We started in 2004.
The first thing you have to consider is that there are parts of the world that are dark spots in terms of attention.
One of those dark spots is Madagascar , a country which is generally better known for the Dreamworks film than it is actually known for the lovely people who live there.
but what happened was that Madagascar went through a violent coup.
Now the trick with this is that I ' m guessing most people here don ' t speak Malagasy.
Unfortunately , it ' s a machine translation of the page.
And if you think this is absurd , it ' s not.
They translate roughly 100 articles a day from major newspapers , major websites.
And my question to you is : if Yeeyan can line up 150,000 people to translate the English internet into Chinese , where ' s the English language Yeeyan ? 
When we look for information online , we basically have two strategies.
What are they looking at ?  Maybe we should be looking at it.
To do this , at a certain point , you need someone to bump you out of your flock and into another flock.
Not only does she have to keep our Israeli and Palestinian contributors from killing each other , she has to figure out what is going to interest you about the Middle East.
She ' s a skilled human curator who knows what material is available to her , who ' s able to listen to the audience , and who ' s able to make a selection and push people forward in one fashion or another.
I can ask her what to read.

Last time , I talked about death and dying.
So , the way of treating these diseases in early times was to , in some way or other , exorcise those evil spirits , and this is still going on , as you know.
And the herbals , the botanical books of up to the late Middle Ages , the Renaissance are filled with prescriptions for causing convulsions to shake the evil spirits out.
So what we see in the seventeenth , eighteenth century is the continued search for medications other than camphor that ' ll do the trick.
Not only would it lift , but it might never return.
So , they tried it on a few pigs , and none of the pigs were killed.
So these three psychiatrists , after about two or three weeks of observation , laid him down on a table , connected his temples to a very small source of current.
Well , I have the following from a firsthand observer , who told me this about 35 years ago , when I was thinking about these things for some research project of mine.
And to their amazement , after it was over , he began speaking like he was perfectly well.
It didn ' t work very well on the schizophrenics , but it was pretty clear in the  ' 30s and by the middle of the  ' 40s that electroconvulsive therapy was very , very effective in the treatment of depression.
Bones were broken . Especially in old , fragile people , you couldn ' t use it.
In the late  ' 70s , early  ' 80s , there were others , and they were very effective.
Now , why am I telling you this story at this meeting ? 
I was , in the 1960s , in a marriage . To use the word bad would be perhaps the understatement of the year.
It had to do with being brought up in a family where no one spoke English , no one could read or write English.
Finally , I would schedule -- all my major surgical cases , I was scheduling them for 12 , one o ' clock in the afternoon , because I couldn ' t get out of bed before about 11 o ' clock.
As my referrals began to decrease , I clearly became increasingly depressed until I thought , my God , I can ' t work anymore.
Well , you know what bovine stercus is ? 
But it wasn ' t that simple . Because by the time I got out of that unit , I was not functional at all.
And it was clear -- not to me , because nothing was clear to me at that time anymore -- that I would need long-term hospitalization in that awful place called a mental hospital.
They tried the usual psychotherapy.
And finally , because I was well known in Connecticut , they decided they better have a meeting of the senior staff.
Remember when you were a kid , and you had to step on every line ? 
So they decided -- I didn ' t know this , again , I found this out later -- that the only thing that could be done was for this 43-year-old man to have a pre-frontal lobotomy.
They thought he had a really extraordinary future.
And you know , of course , what ' ll happen if you do a pre-frontal lobotomy.
They just thought ,  " Well , we ' ll give a course of 10.
Six didn ' t work . Seven didn ' t work.
But , lo and behold , by 16 , by 17 , there were demonstrable differences in the way I felt.
And I ' ve never forgotten -- I never will forget -- standing in the kitchen of the unit , it was a Sunday morning in January of 1974 , standing in the kitchen by myself and thinking ,  " I ' ve got the strength now to do this. " 
And she used to go nuts , every five minutes or so in the play , and he said to her ,  " We must have a word to bring you back to reality , and the word , my dear , will be  ' Basingstoke. '  "  So every time she got a little nuts , he would say ,  " Basingstoke! "  And she would say ,  " Basingstoke , it is. "  And she would be fine for a little while.
Much better than  " Basingstoke, "  at least for me . And it worked -- my God , it worked.
At the end of three years , I went back to New Haven , had remarried by that time.
Resuscitated the career , even better than it had been before.
I stopped doing surgery about six years ago and became a full-time writer , as many people know.
So , I ' m not free of all of this . But it ' s worked . It ' s always worked.
That I am someone who has drunk , drank , drunk of the bitter dregs of near-disaster in childhood and emerged not just unscathed but strengthened.
It ' s known by some people in New Haven , obviously , but it is not generally known.
Accidents happen . Something from childhood comes back to haunt you.
If I , with the bleakness of spirit , with no spirit , that I had in the 1970s and no possibility of recovery , as far as that group of very experienced psychiatrists thought , if I can find my way back from this , believe me , anybody can find their way back from any adversity that exists in their lives.
There are resurrection themes in every society that has ever been studied , and it is because not just only do we fantasize about the possibility of resurrection and recovery , but it actually happens . And it happens a lot.
business,culture,exploration,food,global issues,history
Chinese restaurants have played an important role in American history , as a matter of fact.
And Americans love their Chinese food so much they ' ve actually brought it into space.
For example , I took a whole bunch of fortune cookies back to China , gave them to Chinese to see how they would react.
What is it called ? 
You ' ve won a prize!
The short answer is , actually , they ' re from Japan.
So , how did they get to the United States ? 
Well , the short answer is , we locked up all the Japanese during World War II , including those that made fortune cookies , so that ' s the time when the Chinese moved in , kind of saw a market opportunity and took over.
I love this dish.
He ' s retired , deaf and plays a lot of Mahjong.
It was introduced into the United States in the 1800s , but became popularized in the 1920s and the 1930s.
This is a billboard that says :  " Welcome to the birthplace of General Tso. " 
And -- -- I actually found a whole bunch of General Tso ' s relatives who are still in the little town.
Because it doesn ' t look like Chinese food to them.
So , you know , I realized when I was there , General Tso is kind of a lot like Colonel Sanders in America , in that he ' s known for chicken and not war.
So it took about 30 years before the Americans realized that , whoa , chop suey is actually not known in China.
So , these people are going around China asking for chop suey , which is sort of like a Japanese guy coming here and saying , I understand you have a very popular dish in your country called  " leftovers, "  and it is particularly -- -- right ? 
Now back then , the Americans were not clamoring to eat Chinese food.
And not the most PC question to be asked today , but if you kind of look at the popular imagery of the time , not so outlandish.
And it basically made the argument that Chinese men who ate rice would necessarily bring down the standard of living for American men who ate meat.
There ' s a lot of different mysteries , a lot of different legends , but of the ones that I ' ve found that I thought was most interesting is this article from 1904.
Lem Sen , who ' s this guy : I would have made this money , too , but I ' ve spent all this time looking for the American man who stole my recipe.
In fact , if you think about it , Chinese food is the most pervasive food on the planet , served on all seven continents , even Antarctica , because Monday night is Chinese food night at McMurdo Station , which is the main scientific station in Antarctica.
My downstairs neighbor , Alessandra , was completely shocked when I told her ,  " Dude , fried gelato is not Chinese. " 
This is a dish called crispy shredded beef , which has a lot of crisp , a lot of shred , and not a lot of beef.
This is , like , this is something that in the Chinese version has no soup.
So , let ' s take a step back , and kind of , understand what is to be appreciated in America.
Chinese restaurants have done largely the same thing , I would argue , with the menu and the décor -- even the restaurant name -- but without a centralized headquarters.
So whatever it was , it caused people to sort of behave in a mass synchronized way.
Now , I don ' t have a TV , which makes me a freak , but very productive , and -- -- and this episode of  " Lost, "  I understand , where the overweight guy has a lucky number which was not a lucky number , which was how long they ' d been on the island , but they looked , and the numbers did not match.
This actually is a slip that one of the winners had , because the Tennessee lottery security officials were like , oh , no -- like , this can ' t be true.
You know , there are a bunch of them , including Lee ' s China in Omaha -- which is actually run by Koreans , but that ' s another point -- and a bunch of them named China Buffet.
So it ' s kind of part of the phenomenon I called spontaneous self-organization , right , where , like in ant colonies , where little decisions made by -- on the micro-level actually have a big impact on the macro-level.
And the great innovation of Chicken McNuggets was not nuggetfying them , because that ' s kind of an easy concept , but the trick behind Chicken McNuggets was , they were able to remove the chicken from the bone in a cost-effective manner , which is why it took so long for other people to copy them.
So me , General Tso ' s Chicken and this logo are all karmacally related.
We can think of Chinese restaurants perhaps as Linux : sort of an open source thing , right , where ideas from one person can be copied and propagated across the entire system , that there can be specialized versions of Chinese food , you know , depending on the region.
So , the thing is , our historical lore , because of the way we like narratives , are full of vast characters such as , you know , Howard Schultz of Starbucks and Ray Kroc with McDonald ' s and Asa Chandler with Coca-Cola.
http://www.ted.com/talks/fiorenzo_omenetto_silk_the_ancient_material_of_the_future.html
Fiorenzo Omenetto : Silk , the ancient material of the future
I ' ll tell you a little bit more.
It actually gets reintegrated in the body.
The components of this material are just water and protein.
The process of discovery , generally , is inspired by nature.
We want to know how you go from water and protein to this liquid Kevlar , to this natural Kevlar.
And so this starting material is back to the basic building block.
They find their way to self-assemble.
And so what does that mean ? 
And we can store information that ' s film with water and protein.
So let me see.
It ' s actually not limited to films.
You can add a third dimensionality to the film.
But silk is versatile and it goes beyond optics.
You can do bigger things.
And maybe you can use that liquid Kevlar if you need something strong to replace peripheral veins , for example , or maybe an entire bone.
Or if you ' re fashion forward , some silk LED tattoos.
I mentioned it briefly at the beginning ; the protein is biodegradable and biocompatible.
Which means that all the devices that you ' ve seen before and all the formats , in principle , can be implanted and disappear.
And reintegration in the human body is not the only thing , but reintegration in the environment is important.
But probably the most remarkable thing is that it comes full circle.
So that screw that you thought about beforehand can actually be used to screw a bone together -- a fractured bone together -- and deliver drugs at the same , while your bone is healing , for example.
And so that could be --- that could be potentially a good alternative to solar powered refrigerated camels.
In the top , you have a film that has been programmed not to degrade , and in the bottom , a film that has been programmed to degrade in water.
So the thread of discovery that we have really is a thread.
comedy,entertainment,robots,science,technology
So tonight I ' d like to tell you about the intersection that I ' m most excited about at this very moment , which is entertainment and robotics.
With my new venture , Marilyn Monrobot , I would like to use art to create tech.
I ' d like to introduce you to one of our first robots , Data.
Now each of these jokes is labeled with certain attributes.
I actually have no idea what my robot is going to do today.
Some of you in this middle section -- you have red/green paddles.
It ' s just a robot.
Right , so , let the robot stand-up comedy begin.
Ready for some jokes ? 
The bad news is that you only have 24 hours to live. " 
The Swiss have an interesting army . Five hundred years without a war.
 " Come on buddy , I have the toe clippers right here.
One of them falls to the ground.
What can I do ?  " 
There is a silence , and the operator hears a shot.
Because it ' s neither rare nor well done.
Actually , as soon as someone turns it on , I go into the other room and read.
HK : Yay.
And we hope to learn a lot about robot expression.

You understand  " forged currency, "   " forged pictures. " 
Here is my father at age 19.
When I was a child I knew nothing about this , of course.
well , he was basically old enough to be my grandfather.
I was in high school and got a bad grade , a rare event for me , so I decided to hide it from my parents.
Later , while checking my school bag , my mother got hold of my school assignment and immediately saw that the signature was forged.
I remained under the blankets . He entered my room , sat on the corner of the bed , and he was silent , so I pulled the blanket from my head , and when he saw me he started laughing.
I was born in Algeria.
But knowing my father , and how he kept saying that he was a pacifist and non-violent , I found it very hard to picture him with a helmet and gun.
These are mine , I was born an Argentinean.
It was very James Bond.
I had become a mother and he was celebrating his 77th birthday , and suddenly I was very , very afraid.
So , his story . My father was born in Argentina.
So at the age of 14 my father had to work.
This coincided with the time when he threw himself body and soul into chemistry because it was the only consolation for his sadness.
His family was Jewish , so they were hounded.
My father had been instilled with such respect for the law that although he was being persecuted , he ' d never thought of false papers.
Suddenly the man looked very , very interested.
And my father immediately replied that he knew exactly how to bleach it.
That ' s my father.
He told himself it was necessary to make them from scratch.
Anyway , he had to do all this because he was completely obsessed with output.
And this is maybe what explains why , for 30 years , he continued to make false papers at the expense of all kinds of sacrifices.
If he had accepted payment , he wouldn ' t be able to say  " yes "  or  " no "  depending on what he deemed a just or unjust cause.
How can one explain what one does at night in the lab , every single night ? 
They are both in their sixties now.
He ' d say ,  " I ' ll call. "  He wouldn ' t call.
Then as time passed , at the end of almost two years , they thought ,  " Well , perhaps our father has died. " 
After the liberation he made false papers to allow the survivors of concentration camps to immigrate to Palestine before the creation of Israel.
And then my father connected with Nelson Mandela ' s anti-apartheid party.
Then there was the Vietnam War.
There , just once , it happened in May of 1968.
He told me that those false papers were the most media-relevant and the least useful he ' d had to make in all his life.
Anyhow , nobody would have followed them , except for a handful [of] men and women of conviction and courage.
He told me that he would have been unable to witness or submit to injustice without doing anything.
His name is Adolfo Kaminsky and I ' m going to ask him to stand up.

We ' re the first generation -- thanks to science -- to be informed that we may be undermining the stability and the ability of planet Earth to support human development as we know it.
On this journey , I ' d like to bring , apart from yourselves , a good friend , a stakeholder , who ' s always absent when we deal with the negotiations on environmental issues , a stakeholder who refuses to compromise -- planet Earth.
We ' ve had the same , roughly , abilities that developed civilizations as we know it.
A thousand years into this period , we abandon our hunting and gathering patterns.
The only phase , as we know it that can support humanity.
The majority of the planet , aspiring for development , having the right for development , are in large aspiring for an unsustainable lifestyle , a momentous pressure.
The forth pressure is surprise , the notion and the evidence that we need to abandon our old paradigm , that ecosystems behave linearly , predictably , controllably in our -- so to say -- linear systems , and that in fact , surprise is universal , as systems tip over very rapidly , abruptly and often irreversibly.
Well , the evidence is , unfortunately , ample.
You see , for the first time , an imprint on the global level.
Sorry . Changing state and literally ending up in an undesired situation , where new biophysical logic takes over , new species take over , and the system gets locked.
The Arctic -- a beautiful system -- a regulating biome at the planetary level , taking the knock after knock on climate change , appearing to be in a good state.
It may get locked in an undesired state , because it changes color , absorbs more energy , and the system may get stuck.
30 or so scientists around the world gathered and asked a question for the first time ,  " Do we have to put the planet into the the pot ?  " 
In fact , you ' re not even allowed to stand where this gentleman is standing , at the foaming , slippery waters at the threshold.
And could we even , thanks to major advancements in Earth systems science , identify the thresholds , the points where we may expect nonlinear change ? 
It may surprise you that it ' s not only climate.
Together , these form an integrated whole for guiding human development in the Anthropocene , understanding that the planet is a complex self-regulating system.
Now this is the Big Bang equivalent then of human development within the safe operating space of the planetary boundaries.
In the  ' 60s already , through the green revolution and the Haber-Bosch process of fixing nitrogen from the atmosphere -- you know , human ' s today take out more nitrogen from the atmosphere than the whole biosphere does naturally as a whole.
But this gives a new paradigm to guide humanity , to put the light on our , so far overpowered industrial vehicle , which operates as if we ' re only on a dark , straight highway.
In fact , there is ample science to indicate that we can do this transformative change , that we have the ability to now move into a new innovative , a transformative gear , across scales.
We have to invest in transformations capability , moving from crisis into innovation and the ability to rise after a crisis , and of course to adapt to unavoidable change.
Do we have any examples of success on this mind shift being applied at the local level ? 
Under the realization from tourist operators , fishermen , the Australian Great Barrier Reef Authority and scientists that the Great Barrier Reef is doomed under the current governance regime.
But again , a crisis , new partnerships , actors locally , transforming these into a key component of sustainable urban planning.
We need nothing less than a new green revolution , and the planet boundaries shows that agriculture has to go from a source of greenhouse gases to a sink.
And we need a transformation.
We know that we have to move from our fossil dependence very quickly into a low-carbon economy in record time.
You get people out of poverty.
What are the planetary boundaries within which we can safely operate ?  " 
They sort of say the harsh news , that we are facing the largest transformative development since the industrialization.
Vik Muniz makes art from pretty much anything , be it shredded paper , wire , clouds or diamonds . Here he describes the thinking behind his work and takes us on a tour of his incredible images.
I was asked to come here and speak about creation.
While creation sometimes seems a bit un-graspable , or even pointless , creativity is always meaningful.
You know , when I was a teenager , I was a creator.
Though it ' s actually true , you know , the reason I ' m talking to you right now is because I was born in Brazil.
You didn ' t trust information very much.
It was very -- actually , it was a very good study , and got me a job in an ad agency.
Somebody was hitting somebody else with brass knuckles.
Luckily , it wasn ' t fatal , as you can all see.
You know , I became -- I took this very iconoclastic approach.
The first works were actually objects.
This is the clown skull.
Unfortunately , it has become obsolete because it was designed for Atari platform.
Actually , the idea came out of an argument that I had at Starbucks , that I insisted that I wasn ' t having Colombian coffee ; the coffee was actually pre-Columbian.
I wanted to take that into the realm of images , and I decided to make things that had the same identity conflicts.
But I was still , you know -- this is a kitty cloud.
 " The Teapot. " 
First , he got an age-old way of making it , which was relief , and he worked this with three-point perspective , which was brand-new technology at the time.
So I decided to make these very simple renderings , that at first they are taken as a line drawing -- you know , something that ' s very -- and then I did it with wire.
It had a physicality , and you start going deeper and deeper into sort of narrative that goes this way , towards the image . So this is  " Monkey with Leica. " 
I started taking that into the realm of landscape , which is something that ' s almost a picture of nothing.
This is  " 6,500 Yards, "  after Corot .  " 9,000 Yards, "  after Gerhard Richter.
I got some photographs from them.
It was just the name of the child , with the little thing you get to know of somebody that you meet very briefly.
Because I was doing this while I was making these pictures , I realized that I could add still another thing I was trying to make a subject -- something that would interfere with the themes , so chocolate is very good , because it has -- it brings to mind ideas that go from scatology to romance.
And Jackson Pollock also.
And I picked minimalist pieces because they ' re about specificity.
This is Richard Serra.
But once they ' re applied to numeric structure , then you can feel more comfortable.
And you have to walk very far to be able to see it.
I tried to prove that he didn ' t do that thing in the Salt Lake.
And at the same time , I was doing these very large constructions , being 150 meters away.
This is like you see -- the size of a person over there.
And I love this work , because I did these cartoonish clouds over Manhattan for a period of two months.
So they ' re like perfect actors.
And it was quite fascinating , because you know the guy -- his name was Joey Grimaldi -- he impersonated the Moorish general -- you know , for the first three minutes he was really that general , and then he went back into plumber , he worked as a plumber , so -- plumber , general , plumber , general -- so for three dollars , I saw two tragedies for the price of one.
Well , I think that ' s it.
DNA,biology,evolution,science
But before doing that , I just briefly want to remind you about what you already know : that our genomes , our genetic material , are stored in almost all cells in our bodies in chromosomes in the form of DNA , which is this famous double-helical molecule.
And we can then see the result of such mutations when we compare DNA sequences among us here in the room , for example.
Approximately one letter in a hundred will differ from a chimpanzee.
The two human DNA sequences go back to a common ancestor quite recently.
So we can now , in a matter of hours , determine a whole human genome.
And what you can then also begin to do is to say ,  " How are these genetic differences distributed across the world ?  " 
Yet the people inside Africa have more genetic variation.
And together with the methods to date these genetic differences , this has led to the insight that modern humans -- humans that are essentially indistinguishable from you and me -- evolved in Africa , quite recently , between 100 and 200,000 years ago.
Another consequence of this recent origin of modern humans is that genetic variants are generally distributed widely in the world , in many places , and they tend to vary as gradients , from a bird ' s-eye perspective at least.
There is , for example , a project that ' s underway to sequence a thousand individuals -- their genomes -- from different parts of the world.
And it ' s a lot : 38 million variable positions.
And the answer to that , among those millions of differences , is that there is not a single such position.
So this is very surprising.
So what this means now is that those traits we then look at and so readily see -- facial features , skin color , hair structure -- are not determined by single genes with big effects , but are determined by many different genetic variants that seem to vary in frequency between different parts of the world.
But so those are all parts of our bodies where we very directly interact with our environment , in a direct confrontation , if you like.
There were other forms of humans around , most famously perhaps , Neanderthals -- these robust forms of humans , compared to the left here with a modern human skeleton on the right -- that existed in Western Asia and Europe since several hundreds of thousands of years.
So this involves a lot of technical issues in how you extract the DNA , how you convert it to a form you can sequence.
And one question that you may then want to ask is , what happened when we met ? 
Does it match one African or the other African ? 
Statistically speaking , there is no difference in how often the Neanderthal matches one African or the other.
This may also be surprising because the Neanderthals were never in China.
So that today , the people living outside Africa have about two and a half percent of their DNA from Neanderthals.
And we found that this individual shared a common origin for his DNA sequences with Neanderthals around 640,000 years ago.
So we can then ask for Denisovans the same things as for the Neanderthals : Did they mix with ancestors of present day people ? 
So from studying these genomes of extinct humans , we ' re beginning to arrive at a picture of what the world looked like when modern humans started coming out of Africa.
They meet Neanderthals , mix with them , continue to spread over the world , and somewhere in Southeast Asia , they meet Denisovans and mix with them and continue on out into the Pacific.
Presumably , modern humans emerged somewhere in Africa.
We learn perhaps many things , but one thing that I find sort of important to mention is that I think the lesson is that we have always mixed.
Four-star general Stanley McChrystal shares what he learned about leadership over his decades in the military . How can you build a sense of shared purpose among people of many ages and skill sets ?  By listening and learning -- and addressing the possibility of failure.
Ten years ago , on a Tuesday morning , I conducted a parachute jump at Fort Bragg , North Carolina.
And you put on the T-10 parachute.
He checks you out , he grabs your adjusting straps and he tightens everything so that your chest is crushed , your shoulders are crushed down , and , of course , he ' s tightened so your voice goes up a couple octaves as well.
Then you take off.
They give 20 minutes -- that ' s a time warning.
And that ' s to boost everybody ' s confidence , to show that you ' re not scared.
If you ' re an inboard personnel , stand up.
There ' s no way to get out of this at this point. " 
The jumpmasters start to check the door.
You fall outside the door , you ' re caught in the slipstream.
And then you wait for the opening shock for your parachute to open.
Boom.
You can ' t delay that much.
Now the Army teaches you to do five points of performance -- the toes of your feet , your calves , your thighs , your buttocks and your push-up muscles.
I always landed like a watermelon out of a third floor window.
They ' d be doing everything that we had taught them.
So now I do that Tuesday morning jump , but it ' s not any jump -- that was September 11th , 2001.
But things had changed ; I was a 46-year-old brigadier general.
This was my father in Vietnam.
One of my first battalion commanders , I worked in his battalion for 18 months and the only conversation he ever had with Lt . McChrystal was at mile 18 of a 25-mile road march , and he chewed my ass for about 40 seconds.
And I had an armored organization at that point.
Sort of leadership by humiliation.
And I went up to apologize to him , and he said ,  " Stanley , I thought you did great. " 
But everything we do is in a different context.
A 22-year-old individual operating alone , thousands of miles from me , has got to communicate to me with confidence.
We had one operation where we had to coordinate it from multiple locations.
We failed.
Also , the people had changed.
And so instead of giving orders , you ' re now building consensus and you ' re building a sense of shared purpose.
I asked ,  " Where were you on 9/11 ?  " 
It also produced something which I call an inversion of expertise , because we had so many changes at the lower levels in technology and tactics and whatnot , that suddenly the things that we grew up doing wasn ' t what the force was doing anymore.
And yet , again , you ' re not all in one room.
You don ' t reset , or recharge your battery every time.
And he said ,  " Sir , he ' s fine . Thanks for asking. " 
Think about knowing that over time.
I learned they are the sinew which hold the force together.
And it ' s not a mindless mantra , and it ' s not a poem.
Think about it . It ' s extraordinarily powerful.
And I learned personal relationships were more important than ever.
That was my journey.
It ' s not like that electronic abs machine where , 15 minutes a month , you get washboard abs.
And if you ' re a leader , the people who count on you need you on your feet.

J.J . from  " Good Times, "  significant to many people of course because of  " Dy-no-mite, "  but perhaps more significant as the first , really , black artist on primetime TV.
I ' m showing two artists here , Glenn Ligon and Carol Walker , two of many who really form for me the essential questions that I wanted to bring as a curator to the world.
It looked at the intersection of race and gender in contemporary American art.
One of the things that happened very distinctly in the course of this exhibition is I was confronted with idea of how powerful images can be and people ' s understanding of themselves and each other.
And she pointed to the image on the right as an example , to me , of the kind of dignity that needed to be portrayed to work against those images in the media.
Harlem now , sort of explaining and thinking of itself in this part of the century , looking both backwards and forwards ...
Can a museum house artists and allow them to be change agents as communities rethink themselves ? 
In some cases , I know that many of you are involved in cross-cultural dialogues , you ' re involved in ideas of creativity and innovation.
And I bring this up because it ' s important to locate this practice in history.
After his lecture , a student got up and said to him ,  " Give us a poem. " 
What that might mean for cultural movements all over this moment , the  " me , we "  seems incredibly prescient totally important.
It is really in this sense of discovery that I have a new set of questions that I ' m asking.
Really , most exciting about this is thinking about the energy and the excitement that young artists can bring.
It is why I look to art.
It ' s considering the implications of what this generation has to say to the rest of us.
For me , it is about re-imagining this cultural discourse in an international context.
What do I think about when I think about art ?

Jamais Cascio on tools for a better world
Alex Steffen and I founded Worldchanging in late 2003 , and since then we and our growing global team of contributors have documented the ever-expanding variety of solutions that are out there , right now and on the near horizon.
We want to offer people an idea of what they can do about it.
Also , a number of the topics that we ' ve been talking about this week at TED are things that we ' ve addressed in the past on Worldchanging : cradle-to-cradle design , MIT ' s Fab Labs , the consequences of extreme longevity , the One Laptop per Child project , even Gapminder.
In difficult times , pessimism is a self-fulfilling , self-inflicted death sentence. " 
Most importantly , we have the motive : we have a world that needs fixing , and nobody ' s going to do it for us.
We know that people often change their behavior when they can see and understand the impact of their actions.
Community tools , like text messaging , that can tell you when pollen counts are up or smog levels are rising or a natural disaster is unfolding , can give you the information you need to act in a timely fashion.
For example , open-access journals , like the Public Library of Science , make cutting-edge scientific research free to all -- everyone in the world.
But my favorite example has to be the global response to the SARS epidemic in 2003 , 2004 , which relied on worldwide access to the full gene sequence of the SARS virus.
For many of us , cell phones have really become almost an extension of ourselves , and we ' re really now beginning to see the social changes that mobile phones can bring about.
In Kenya , mobile phone minutes have actually become an alternative currency.
It ' s no exaggeration to say that the mobile phone may be among the world ' s most important technologies.
Not only does this add a new and potentially safer avenue for documenting abuses , it opens up the program to the growing global digital generation.
It would give everyday citizens a chance to play a role in the protection of the planet.
Now , many of the people who participate in Earth Witness would focus on ecological problems , human-caused or otherwise , especially environmental crimes and significant sources of greenhouse gases and emissions.
In the best Worldchanging tradition , it might also serve as a showcase for good ideas , successful projects and efforts to make a difference that deserve much more visibility.
Camera phones , of course , would be fundamental to the project.
Over the course of last year , open-source hardware hackers have come up with multiple models for usable , Linux-based mobile phones , and the Earth Phone could spin off from this kind of project.
An Earth Witness site could also serve as a collection spot for all sorts of data about conditions around the planet picked up by environmental sensors that attach to your cell phone.
Swedish firm Uppsala Biomedical , more seriously , makes a mobile phone add-on that can process blood tests in the field , uploading the data , displaying the results.
Now , all of this data could be tagged with geographic information and mashed up with online maps for easy viewing and analysis.
Earth Witness would take this further , linking what you see with what thousands or millions of other people see around the world.
And most important , you can ' t ignore how important mobile phones are to global youth.
Now , as I suggested at the outset , there are thousands upon thousands of good ideas out there , so why have I spent the bulk of my time telling you about something that doesn ' t exist ? 
We have at our fingertips a cornucopia of compelling models , powerful tools , and innovative ideas that can make a meaningful difference in our planet ' s future.
We just need to open our eyes . Thank you very much.

So if you think of a map of your country , I think you ' ll realize that for every country on Earth , you could draw little circles to say ,  " These are places where good teachers won ' t go. " 
I basically embedded a computer into a wall of a slum in New Delhi.
But I repeated this all over India and then through a large part of the world and noticed that children will learn to do what they want to learn to do.
In another South Indian village , these boys here had assembled a video camera and were trying to take the photograph of a bumble bee.
We started off with an experiment in Hyderabad , India , where I gave a group of children -- they spoke English with a very strong Telugu accent.
Make yourself understood to the computer. " 
Two months later -- and this is now documented in the Information Technology for International Development journal -- that accents had changed and were remarkably close to the neutral British accent in which I had trained the speech-to-text synthesizer.
I got an interesting phone call once from Columbo , from the late Arthur C . Clarke , who said ,  " I want to see what ' s going on. " 
And I was doing that in the field , so every time I would watch it and think of him.
This is a 15 year-old boy.
This is in Cambodia , rural Cambodia -- a fairly silly arithmetic game , which no child would play inside the classroom or at home.
This is what these children are doing.
They said ,  " They have become really deep thinkers and so on and so forth.
At that time , a large amount of money had come into Newcastle University to improve schooling in India.
I wanted to test the limits of the system.
I called in 26 children.
So I left them with it.
 " Did you understand anything ?  "   " No , nothing. " 
So a 12 year-old girl raises her hand and says , literally ,  " Apart from the fact that improper replication of the DNA molecule causes genetic disease , we ' ve understood nothing else. " 
Well , one of the girls had taught herself to become the teacher.
and she says ,  " The neuron ?  The neuron, "  and then she looked and did this.
So I found that they had a friend , a local accountant , a young girl , and they played football with her.
She said ,  " What ' s that ?  " 
The scores went up to 50 , which is what the posh schools of New Delhi , with a trained biotechnology teacher were getting.
In Gateshead , I took 32 children and I started to fine-tune the method.
Remember , from the Hole in the Wall.
And I explained to them that , you know , a lot of scientific research is done using that method.
The worst , in 45.
I ' ll come back after two months.
There was photographic recall inside the children , I suspect because they ' re discussing with each other.
Here in Britain , I put out a call for British grandmothers , after my Kuppam experiment.
So they did that , and over the last two years , over 600 hours of instruction has happened over Skype , using what my students call the granny cloud.
You say it.
Teacher : Well done . Very good ...
They wanted to be footballers before.
The furniture is designed so that children can sit in front of big , powerful screens , big broadband connections , but in groups.
So how far can we go ?  One last little bit and I ' ll stop.
I started writing English questions on the blackboard.
Fifteen minutes later -- next question : where is Calcutta ? 
There was silence for a while , then they said ,  " You ' ve spelled it wrong.
These are 10 year-olds.
A self-organizing system is one where a structure appears without explicit intervention from the outside.
It ' ll take a few years to prove it , experimentally , but I ' m going to try.

Jacqueline Novogratz on patient capitalism
But literally within days of arriving I was told , in no uncertain terms , by a number of West African women , that Africans didn ' t want saving , thank you very much , least of all not by me.
And I did , and we ended up naming it Duterimbere , meaning  " to go forward with enthusiasm. "  And while we were doing it , I realized that there weren ' t a lot of businesses that were viable and started by women , and so maybe I should try to run a business , too.
I also found out that the bakery was nothing like a business , that , in fact , it was a classic charity run by a well-intentioned person , who essentially spent 600 dollars a month to keep these 20 women busy making little crafts and baked goods , and living on 50 cents a day , still in poverty.
And the epitome was when I literally marched into the streets of Nyamirambo , which is the popular quarter of Kigali , with a bucket , and I sold all these little doughnuts to people , and I came back , and I was like ,  " You see ?  " 
And with that confidence surge , I thought ,  " Well , it ' s time to create a real bakery , so let ' s paint it. "  And the women said ,  " That ' s a really great idea. " 
So , one week , two weeks , three weeks went by , and finally I said ,  " Well , how about blue ?  " 
The walls were blue , the windows were blue , the sidewalk out front was painted blue.
And I said ,  " And I think the color is perfect, "  and they all nodded their head , except for Gaudence , and I said ,  " What ?  " 
And so then I learned that listening is not only about waiting , but it ' s also learning how better to ask questions.
As Eleni has said , when people gain income , they gain choice , and that is fundamental to dignity.
Yes , we ran this as a business , but someone needed to pay the philanthropic support that came into the training , and the management support , the strategic advice and , maybe most important of all , the access to new contacts , networks and new markets.
I think the market can help us figure that out , but there ' s got to be a charitable component , or I don ' t think we ' re going to create the kind of societies we want to live in.
We ' ve invested about 20 million dollars in 20 different enterprises , and have , in so doing , created nearly 20,000 jobs , and delivered tens of millions of services to people who otherwise would not be able to afford them.
And so as people get healthier , they also get wealthier.
Now , this plant is an Artemisia plant ; it ' s the basic component for artemisinin , which is the best-known treatment for malaria.
So that ' s about 50,000 people affected.
And I really understood what patient capital meant emotionally in the last month or so . Because the company was literally 10 days away from proving that the product they produced was at the world-quality level needed to make Coartem , when they were in the biggest cash crisis of their history.
And it ' s really time we start thinking more creatively about how they can be fused.
So he moved back to the farm , and , long story short , they now have seven acres under cultivation.
It ' s another one that lives at the confluence of health and enterprise.
UNICEF came forward and said ,  " We ' ll buy most of the nets , and then we ' ll give them away , as part of the global fund ' s and the U.N. ' s commitment to pregnant women and children , for free. " 
It ' s gone from socialist Tanzania into capitalist Tanzania , and continued to flourish . It had about 1,000 employees when we first found it.
We thought the hitting-it-out-of-the-box number was 150,000 nets a year.
But it ' s only half the story if we ' re really looking at solving problems of poverty , because it ' s not long-term sustainable.
It costs , at manufacturing point , six dollars to produce these , and it costs the establishment another six dollars to distribute it , so the market price in a free market would be about 12 dollars per net.
We can start building local distribution , and actually , it can cost the public sector much less. " 
And that some of the channels we thought would work didn ' t work.
We ' ve got to start having conversations like this , and I don ' t think there ' s any better way to start than using the market , but also to bring other people to the table around it.
She moved to the United States , where she met my grandfather , who was a cement hauler , and they had nine children . Three of them died as babies.
I look around at my siblings and my cousins -- and as I said , there are a lot of us -- and I see teachers and musicians , hedge fund managers , designers.
But what it takes is a commitment from all of us to essentially refuse trite assumptions , get out of our ideological boxes.
http://www.ted.com/talks/adam_sadowsky_engineers_a_viral_music_video.html
Adam Sadowsky engineers a viral music video
Some of you may recognize this image.
And we were very excited about this because , of course , they have a history of dancing with machines.
A fantastically viral and wonderful video.
Now , for those of you who don ' t know , a Rube Goldberg machine is a complicated contraption , an incredibly over-engineered piece of machinery that accomplishes a relatively simple task.
So we came up with a list of requirements , the  " 10 commandments, "  and they were , in order of ascending difficulty : The first is  " No magic. " 
They wanted the machine action to follow the song feeling.
It included an exterior loading dock.
So the machine would get started , it would travel some distance , reacting along the way , hit play on an iPod or a tape deck or something that would start playback.
They wanted it to end precisely on time.
Okay.
Of those 85 takes , only three actually successfully completed their run.
And another engineer thought ,  " Well , that would be a really good thing to use "  and ended up using it as a really nice trigger.
And we learned that small stuff stinks.
But as much as the small stuff stinks , we needed somewhere to start , so that we would have somewhere to go.
You know , we spent a lot of time ideating and even building some of these things.
And so while planning is important , so is flexibility.
The little Lego car in the beginning of the video references the big , real car near the end of the video.
So you put that up front so that , if it fails , at least you know you don ' t have to reset the whole thing.
And the wonderful elation that we had when we finally completed it.
We are OK Go.
I mean ,  " Curiosity "  -- excuse me.
Have you seen the new work they ' ve done to the Waltz Towers ? 
[unclear] Kay , we can still do one better I think , yeah.
Art history is far from set in stone . Engineer Maurizio Seracini spent 30 years searching for Leonardo da Vinci’s lost fresco “The Battle of Anghiari,” and in the process discovered that many paintings have layers of history hidden underneath . Should they be part of the viewing experience too ? 
In 1975 , I met in Florence a professor , Carlo Pedretti , my former professor of art history , and today a world-renowned scholar of Leonardo da Vinci.
Well , this time , we focused on trying to reconstruct the way the Hall of the 500 was before the remodeling , and the so-called Sala Grande , which was built in 1494 , and to find out the original doors , windows , and in order to do that , we first created a 3D model , and then , with thermography , we went on to discover hidden windows . These are the original windows of the hall of the Sala Grande . We also found out about the height of the ceiling , and we managed to reconstruct , therefore , all the layout of this original hall the way it was before there came Vasari , and restructured the whole thing , including a staircase that was very important in order to precisely place  " The Battle of Anghiari "  on a specific area of one of the tools.
And we did find many on the right panel of the east wall , an air gap , and that ' s where we believe  " The Battle of Anghiari, "  or at least the part that we know has been painted , which is called  " The Fight for the Standard, "  should be located.
We came back in the Hall of the 500 in 2011 , and this time , with a great group of students , and my colleague , Professor Falko Kuester , who is now the director at CISA3 , and we came back just since we knew already where to look for to find out if there was still something left.
I had also had the privilege since the last 37 years to work on several masterpieces as you can see behind me , but basically to do what ?  Well , to assess , for example , the state of conservation . See here the face of the Madonna of the Chair that when just shining a UV light on it you suddenly see another , different lady , aged lady , I should rather say.
A lot has been said and written about the unicorn , but if you take an X-ray of the unicorn , it becomes a puppy dog.
But I would say the discovery that really caught my imagination , my admiration , is the incredibly vivid drawing under this layer , brown layer , of  " The Adoration of the Magi. "  Here you see a handmade setting XYZ scanner with an infrared camera put on it , and just peering through this brown layer of this masterpiece to reveal what could have been underneath.
This was an epiphany . We came to understand and to prove that the brown coating that we see today was not done by Leonardo da Vinci , which left us only the other drawing that for five centuries we were not able to see , so thanks only to technology.
And we just aim the camera of the tablet to the painting that we are interested to see , like this.
So all we need is one finger . Just wipe off and we see the elephant.
Well , we believe , again , that this should be the beginning , the very first step , to do real conservation , and allowing us to really explore and to understand everything related to the state of our conservation , the technique , materials , and also if , when , and why we should restore , or , rather , to intervene on the environment surrounding the painting.
We ' re trying to give a future to our past in order to have a future.
demo,design,flight,green,solar,technology,transportation
Well , it ' s the era of a lot of different things that we ' re in right now . But one thing for sure : it ' s the era of change . There ' s more change going on than ever has occurred in the history of human life on earth.
This is unprecedented , and it ' s big.
Certainly , 10,000 years ago , the civilization ' s beginning , the human portion was less than one tenth of one percent . Let ' s look at it now.
Now , the third curve is information technology.
That first one is humans-versus-nature ; we ' ve won , there ' s no more gain . Human population.
And then , the size of the Earth . Somehow making these all compatible with the Earth looks like a pretty bad industry to be involved with.
The institutions of the past with all their inertia are just irrelevant for the future , except they ' re there and we have to deal with them . I spend about 15 percent of my time trying to save the world , the other 85 percent , the usual -- and whatever else we devote ourselves to.
Your great-great grandparents got by on muscle power , and yet we all think there ' s this huge power that ' s essential for our lifestyle . And with all the wonderful technology we have we can do things that are much more efficient : conserve , recycle , etc.
Trying to have it fly straight is like trying to shoot an arrow with the feathered end forward . It was a tough job , and boy it made me have a lot of respect for nature.
We got a lot of people thinking about electric cars , what you could do with them . A few years later , when we suggested to GM that now is the time and we could do a thing called the Impact , they sponsored it , and here ' s the Impact that we developed with them on their programs . This is the demonstrator . And they put huge effort into turning it into a commercial product.
With onboard GPS , it can navigate autonomously , and it is rugged enough to self-land without damage.
Humans and soaring birds have found nature to be generous in providing replenishable energy . Sailplanes have flown over 1,000 miles , and the altitude record is over 50,000 feet.
Buckminster Fuller said it clearly :  " there are no passengers on spaceship Earth , only crew . We , the crew , can and must do more with less -- much less. " 
And we worked very closely with the whole thing being a team effort , and with wonderful results like that flight.
some things he showed as a celebration at the very end.
PM : We have real-time IR scans going out through the Internet while the plane is flying . And it ' s exploring without polluting the stratosphere . That ' s its goal : the stratosphere , the blanket that really controls the radiation of the earth and permits life on earth to be the success that it is -- probing that is very important . And also we consider it as a sort of poor man ' s stationary satellite , because it can stay right overhead for months at a time , 2,000 times closer than the real GFC synchronous satellite.
So Matt Keenan , just any time you ' re -- all right -- ready to let her go . But first , we ' re going to make sure that it ' s appearing on the screen , so you see what it sees.
MK : Can you bring up the house lights ? 
Oh , that was only a minute , but I think you ' d be safe to have that near the end of the flight , perhaps.
OK.
But there ' s a lot of technology going.
MK : Sorry.
But you ' re beginning to see what can be done.
You can do amazing things when you realize what nature has been doing all along . As you get to these small scales , you realize we have a lot to learn from nature -- not with 747s -- but when you get down to the nature ' s realm , nature has 200 million years of experience.
The first I ' ll just read . At last , I put in three sentences and had it say what I wanted.
Every 25 years I do a picture . Here ' s the one -- tries to show that the world isn ' t getting any bigger.
This is a warning , and we have to think seriously about it.
I personally think the surviving intelligent life form on earth is not going to be carbon-based ; it ' s going to be silicon-based.
PM : Last night we gave it a few too many turns and it tried to bash the roof out also . It ' s about a gram.
So , be gentle , just act like a wooden Indian or something.
We can probably get it down , but it ' s possible it ' s gone up to a greater destiny up there -- -- than it ever had . And I wanted to make -- just -- But I want to make just two points . One is , you think it ' s frivolous ; there ' s nothing to it . And yet if I had not been making ornithopters like that , a little bit cruder , in 1939 -- a long , long time ago -- there wouldn ' t have been a Gossamer Condor , there wouldn ' t have been an Albatross , a Solar Challenger , there wouldn ' t be an Impact car , there wouldn ' t be a mandate on zero-emission vehicles in California.

Elizabeth Murchison : Fighting a contagious cancer
Many of you might be familiar with Taz , the cartoon character , the one that spins around and around and around.
The Tasmanian devil is predominantly a scavenger , and it uses its powerful jaws and its sharp teeth to chomp on the bones of rotting dead animals.
But the Tasmanian devil population has been undergoing a really extremely fast decline.
At the time , this was thought to be a one-off.
Now there ' s only a small part of the population , which remains unaffected.
But inevitably , these tumors progress towards being enormous , ulcerating tumors like this one here.
Her guts were swimming with parasitic worms.
They were too young to survive without their mother.
All the evidence suggested that this devil cancer was spread by a virus.
Cancer is a disease that affects millions of people around the world every year.
Paradoxically , once established , natural selection actually favors the continued growth of cancer.
It evolves.
So cancer could be thought of as a strange , short-lived , self-destructive life form -- an evolutionary dead end.
The next slide is going to be gruesome.
So I took this opportunity to collect some samples from Jonas '  tumor and also some samples from other parts of his body.
In fact , Jonas and his tumor were as different from each other as you and the person sitting next to you.
Well the next breakthrough came from studying hundreds of Tasmanian devil cancers from all around Tasmania.
But how can a cancer spread in a population ? 
When the devil bites another devil , it actually physically implants living cancer cells into the next devil , so the tumor continues to grow.
But if this can happen in Tasmanian devils , why hasn ' t it happened in other animals or even humans ? 
Last year , his owner noticed some blood trickling from his genital region.
The vet diagnosed this as transmissible venereal tumor , a sexually transmitted cancer that affects dogs.
We also believe this cancer might be very old.
It ' s a living relic of the distant past.
Ad he decided to put this to the test by actually deliberately inoculating people with cancer from somebody else.
What this tells us , ethical issues aside , is that ...
So just finally , cancer is an inevitable outcome of the ability of our cells to divide and to adapt to their environments.
Let ' s prevent the Tasmanian devil from being the first animal to go extinct from cancer.

40 percent of all post-conflict situations , historically , have reverted back to conflict within a decade.
The first principle is : it ' s the politics that matters.
So get peacekeepers there , but get them home as soon as possible.
That will produce a legitimate and accountable government.
There ' s certainly no quick security fix.
Does an election produce an accountable and legitimate government ? 
It ' s not the politics first ; it ' s actually the politics last.
Because after years of stagnation and decline , the mentality of politics is that it ' s a zero-sum game.
You can only get positive , that mental shift , if the reality is that prosperity is being built.
And so now let me suggest two complimentary approaches to changing the reality of the situations.
And that needs to be recognized , first of all , that peacekeeping works.
It needs to be a decade-long approach , rather than just a couple of years.
Typically in the past , the donors have been interested in the first couple of years , and then they got bored.
You can do that quite fast.
One is it ' s got to do economic reform , not fuss about the political constitution.
So this legacy of conflict is really bad economic policy.
So the inclusion agenda means genuinely bringing people inside the tent.
If you don ' t get the policy reform and the aid , you don ' t get the economic recovery , which is the true exit strategy for the peacekeepers.
The United Nations even has an agency which could broker these compacts ; it ' s called the Peace Building Commission.
And that is to focus on a few critical objectives.
And I want to suggest that in the typical post-conflict situation three things are critical.
Those are the three critical priorities.
And why are jobs so important ? 
And why are they upset ?  Because they have nothing to do.
That is not a good idea.
These are not environments where you can build export manufacturing.
During conflict people are doing destruction.
And so the policy priority is to break the bottlenecks in expanding the construction sector.
Often the legal system is broken down so you can ' t even get access to land.
So we need to encourage the growth of local firms.
On the one hand it pays lip service to the idea of rebuild an effective state in the image of Scandinavia in the 1950s.
And so what I ' d suggest is what I call Independent Service Authorities.
So the NGOs become part of a public government system , rather than independent of it.
The good NGOs , like Oxfam , are very keen on this idea.
So they wouldn ' t be provided thanks to the United States government and some NGO.
The typical post-conflict government is so short of money that it needs our money just to be on a life-support system.
It ' s captured by the crooks who are at the heart of the political problem.
So that ' s the -- let me wrap up , this is the package.
So that ' s the focus on the construction sector.
Where would that leave us ? 
china,culture,economics,global issues,government,peace,politics,war
And basically , what I ' d like to tell you is that power is changing , and there are two types of changes I want to discuss.
Those two things are the huge shifts of power in our century.
If we looked at the world in 1800 , you ' d find that more than half of the world ' s people lived in Asia and they made more than half the world ' s product.
That ' s important and it ' s an important shift.
But to make it more real , if the price of an automobile had fallen as rapidly as the price of computing power , you could buy a car today for five dollars.
The technology was there.
So capabilities that were once restricted are now available to everyone.
The State ' s not alone . There are many , many actors.
We think in terms of war and interstate war.
So we ' re seeing a great change in terms of diffusion of power.
You can do it with threats of coercion ,  " sticks, "  you can do it with payments ,  " carrots, "  or you can do it by getting others to want what you want.
Traditionally , the way people thought about power was primarily in terms of military power.
It ' s not whose army wins ; it ' s also whose story wins.
And the current narrative is all about the rise of China and the decline of the United States.
But in fact , this metaphor of decline is often very misleading.
In the 1980s , as America went through a transition in the Reagan period , between the rust belt economy of the midwest to the Silicon Valley economy of California , that was the end of America.
If we try to focus on the reality , then what we need to focus on is what ' s really happening in terms of China and the United States.
Now someday , with a billion point three people getting richer , they are going to be bigger than the United States.
You know , everything says , here ' s the growth rate of China , here ' s the growth rate of the U.S. , here it goes -- straight line.
China still has large areas of underdevelopment and per capita income is a better measure of the sophistication of the economy.
Doesn ' t tell you much about military power , doesn ' t tell you very much about soft power.
Indeed , one of the advantages that the Americans will have in terms of power in Asia is all those countries want an American insurance policy against the rise of China.
Why does it matter ?  Who cares ? 
Let me give you an example from history.
Notice both halves of that explanation.
It ' s bad history.
And the greatest danger we have of managing this power transition of the shift toward the East is fear.
Let me say a word now about the distribution of power and how it relates to power diffusion and then pull these two types together.
China ' s not going to replace the U.S . on this military board.
The bottom board of this three-dimensional , the board of transnational relations , things that cross borders outside the control of governments , things like climate change , drug trade , financial flows , pandemics , all these things that cross borders outside the control of governments , there nobody ' s in charge.
Another way of putting it is that as we think of power in the 21st century , we want to get away from the idea that power ' s always zero sum -- my gain is your loss and vice versa.
It ' s one in which we can all gain.
Military power is important.
But unless you learn how to mix hard power with soft power into strategies that I call smart power , you ' re not going to deal with the new kinds of problems that we ' re facing.
And in the 21st century , you have to do an analog to that.
So if one looks at the statements that have been made about this , I am impressed that when Hillary Clinton described the foreign policy of the Obama administration , she said that the foreign policy of the Obama administration was going to be smart power , as she put it ,  " using all the tools in our foreign policy tool box. " 
Set aside the politics : Data shows that climate change is happening , measurably , now . And as Vicki Arroyo says , it ' s time to prepare our homes and cities for the new climate , with its increased risk of flooding , drought and uncertainty . She illustrates this inspiring talk with bold projects from cities all over the world -- local examples of thinking ahead.
This is the skyline of my hometown , New Orleans.
One thousand , eight hundred and thirty-six people died . Nearly 300,000 homes were lost.
In 2008 , Cyclone Nargis and its aftermath killed 138,000 in Myanmar.
There are important distributional consequences , and they ' re not what you always might think.
Will there be tensions over immigration , or conflicts over competition for limited resources ? 
That ' s the Russians planting a flag on the ocean bottom to stake a claim for minerals under the receding Arctic sea ice.
So what can we do ?  How can we prepare and adapt ? 
The devastated church my mom attends has been not only rebuilt higher , it ' s poised to become the first Energy Star church in the country.
For example , in Galveston , here ' s a resilient home that survived Hurricane Ike , when others on neighboring lots clearly did not.
We need to better understand how people make decisions in times of crisis , and why.
Second , preparing for heat and drought.
The stability this provides is giving the farmers the confidence to invest.
After a lethal 1995 heat wave turned refrigerator trucks from the popular Taste of Chicago festival into makeshift morgues , Chicago became a recognized leader , tamping down on the urban heat island impact through opening cooling centers , outreach to vulnerable neighborhoods , planting trees , creating cool white or vegetated green roofs.
The roofs not only temper urban heat island impact but they save energy , and therefore money , the emissions that cause climate change , and they also reduce stormwater runoff.
That ' s where half of Vietnam ' s rice is grown.
Here ' s just one example , San Francisco Airport , with 16 inches or more of flooding.
So these outfall pipes have been retrofitted to shut seawater off from entering the system.
The Asian Cities Climate [Change] Resilience Network is restoring vital ecosystems like forest mangroves.
I think these are inspiring examples of what ' s possible when we feel empowered to plan for a world that will be different.
We ' re entering uncharted territory , and yet our expertise and our systems are based on the past.
The larger point I ' m trying to make is this.
We ' re all learning by doing.
United States,business,china,education,global issues,language
Let ' s start with Beatle mania : hysterical teenagers , crying , screaming , pandemonium.
Manias can be alarming.
Listen as Chinese students practice their English by screaming it.
S : I don ' t want to let my parents down.
T : I don ' t want to let myself down.
Students : A t-shirt . A dress.
Why English ?  In a single word : Opportunity.
She studies 12 hours a day for three years to prepare.
Teacher : Perfect! Students : Perfect!
T : I want to speak -- S : I want to speak -- T : perfect English . S : perfect English.
Is English a tsunami , washing away other languages ?  Not likely.
The world has other universal languages.
Not because America is pushing it , but because the world is pulling it.
John Hunter puts all the problems of the world on a 4 ' x5 '  plywood board -- and lets his 4th-graders solve them . At TED2011 , he explains how his World Peace Game engages schoolkids , and why the complex lessons it teaches -- spontaneous , and always surprising -- go further than classroom lectures can.
I ' m very fortunate to be here.
It feels like I ' ve landed in a colony of angels. " 
Her name is Pam Moran in Albemarle County , Virginia , the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains.
But in her office , there ' s this old wooden , weather-worn table , kitchen table -- peeling green paint , it ' s kind of rickety.
And we ' d come in from playing , he ' d come in from plowing and working , and we ' d sit around that table every night.
The project I ' m going to tell you about is called the World Peace Game , and essentially it is also an empty space.
And my parents were very patient , but I had been doing intermittent sojourns to India on a mystical quest.
And so they pleaded with me to get a degree in something.
And I went in for a job interview in the Richmond Public Schools in Virginia , the capital city , bought a three-piece suit -- my concession to convention -- kept my long beard and my afro and my platform shoes -- at the time it was the  ' 70s -- and I walked in , and I sat down and had an interview.
There weren ' t really many materials or things to use.
She said ,  " What do you want to do ?  " 
So this happened in 1978 , and I was teaching many years later , and a friend of mine introduced me to a young filmmaker.
This film is called  " World Peace and Other 4th Grade Achievements. " 
Now it ' s still in debt , but Chris has managed , through his own sacrifice , to get this film out.
And the strange thing is , when I watch the film -- I have the eerie sensation of seeing it -- I saw myself literally disappear.
I saw Jan Polo ' s flashing eyes.
And you know , she had that old-school teacher stare.
I didn ' t use that stare very often , but I do have it in my repertoire.
That ' s my brother Malcolm there on the right.
And the beautiful thing was , I got to teach my daughter in elementary school , Madeline.
I ' m not here alone.
I was creating a lesson for students on Africa.
So I thought , well they like to play games.
There ' s an outer space layer with black holes and satellites and research satellites and asteroid mining.
They have different assets , commercial and military.
I offer them the job , they can turn it down , and then they choose their own cabinet.
And then there ' s a 13-page crisis document with 50 interlocking problems.
There ' s oil spills , environmental disasters , water rights disputes , breakaway republics , famine , endangered species and global warming.
But they ' re also trying to undermine everything in the game.
They learn to overlook short-sighted reactions and impulsive thinking , to think in a long-term , more consequential way.
I ' m just a clarifier . I ' m just a facilitator.
Boy : The World Peace Game is serious.
And I admit the truth to them right up front : I don ' t know.
It ' s a sincere apology , and they take it very seriously.
JH : My question to you is , who ' s in charge of that classroom ? 
It ' s impossible . Their collective wisdom is much greater than mine , and I admit it to them openly.
And she was next door to a very wealthy , oil-rich neighbor.
We were all upset with her ,  " Why are you doing this ? 
That ' s a breach there.
I thought I was failing as a teacher . Why would she do this ? 
She was able to see the vectors and trend lines and intentions long before any of us and understand what was going to happen and made a philosophical decision to attack in a peace game.
It came about spontaneously through their collective wisdom.
You have to write a letter to their parents -- the fictional parents of your fictional troops -- explaining what happened and offering your condolences.
 " Let ' s ask that mom to read the letter.
She read two sentences.
We all lose.
David : We ' ve really had enough of people attacking.
And so I ' ve been winning battles , so I ' m going into battles , more battles.
And I can ' t design that , I can ' t plan that , and I can ' t even test that.
So I ' ll just share a third story.
Some are poor , some are wealthy . There are billions.
So the team that was the poorest had gotten even poorer.
I should have gotten it so they could have won.
And suddenly , Brennan walked over to my chair and he grabbed the bell , the bell I ring to signal a change or a reconvening of cabinets , and he ran back to his seat , rang the bell.
I didn ' t know what they were doing . I ' d lost control of my classroom.
He rings the bell again . He says ,  " We have "  -- and there ' s 12 seconds left on the clock --  " we have , all nations , pooled all our funds together.
Will you accept it ?  " 
Spontaneous compassion that could not be planned for , that was unexpected and unpredictable.
But I don ' t try to deny them that reality of being human.
If only.
design,education,play,science,technology
I ' ve been making toys for the last 30 years.
America was jolted by the anti-Vietnam movement , the Civil Rights movement.
Lots of people resigned from well-paid jobs and jumped into the National Movement.
So he designed and went and started a village science program.
Start from what they know . Build on what they have. " 
I worked there for two years , and I realized that I was not born to make trucks.
It was a very small village -- a weekly bazaar where people , just once in a week , they put in all the vats.
This is called a cycle valve tube.
It ' s like its own little coupling.
If you look at the hexagon , for instance , it ' s like an amoeba , which is constantly changing its own profile.
Look at the pentagon , for instance , pull this out -- it becomes a boat shape trapezium.
Give it a little push -- this becomes a rhombus.
Because triangles are the only rigid structures.
They always make a triangular roof.
So you make all these 3D shapes.
You can make a joint of four . You can make a joint of six.
This makes an igloo.
If you , as a matter of fact , put four marbles inside , you simulate the molecular structure of methane , CH4.
I see hope . I see happiness in their faces.
It ' s a real pump . You could actually pop the balloon.
You put a little sticky tape.
Now this is what you do , is you bend both these legs into a triangle , and you just wrap some tape around.
If you spin something , it tends to fly out.
If I do it with both hands , you can see this fun Mr . Flying Man.
You see insects , you see frogs , snakes , eagles , butterflies , frogs , snakes , eagles.
The insects are eaten by the frogs ; the frogs are eaten by the snakes ; the snakes are eaten by the eagles.
If you take a smaller paper , you make a smaller flexagon.
And this is a hundred-year-old toy.
Six major research papers on this.
This is there for every child , and every child can enjoy this.
What we ' ve done , we ' ve just sealed both the ends with tape , nipped the right corner and the bottom left corner , so there ' s holes in the opposite corners , there ' s a little hole over here.
And this costs very little money to make -- great fun for children to do.
If you have a battery , it costs five cents to make it.
It ' s the interaction of both these magnets which makes this motor spin.
You can see a gleam in their eye.
This program started with 16 schools and spread to 1,500 government schools.
There are six layers -- three layers of plastic , aluminum -- which are are sealed together.
This is a little straw , and what you do is you just nip two corners here , and this becomes like a baby crocodile ' s mouth.
I ' m going to keep this outside , to blow out . I ' m going to suck in air.
And when you get a very small one -- This is what the kids teach you . You can also do this.
It ' s basically like a fisherman ' s line , a fishing line.
Wool sticks on Velcro.
But this has come as a great boon for them.
These are two magnets.
If I spin this pulley , the small one ' s going to spin much faster.
So this is a small crank generator.
And they ' d be absolutely joyous playing with this.
When first you see Nehru and Gandhi , this is the Nehru cap -- just half a newspaper.
And if you have one of these birds -- children in Japan have been making this bird for many , many years.
The captain was a captain of a sea-going ship.
And the captain would wear a cap everyday and join in the regalia.
And the third day , it would be a Shikari cap -- just like an adventurer ' s cap.
And we must not forget that he was the captain of the ship.
Suddenly there was a storm and huge waves.
And there ' s a third one over here.
How can architects build a new world of sustainable beauty ?  By learning from nature . At TEDSalon in London , Michael Pawlyn describes three habits of nature that could transform architecture and society : radical resource efficiency , closed loops , and drawing energy from the sun.
I ' d like to start with a couple of quick examples.
And to make that , it involves extremes of temperature , extremes of pressure and loads of pollution.
That ' s roughly 10,000 times the range of man-made fire detectors.
And if we ' re to make progress with the sustainability revolution , I believe there are three really big changes we need to bring about.
And for all three of these , I believe , biomimicry has a lot of the solutions that we ' re going to need.
And let ' s start with radical increases in resource efficiency.
Studying pollen grains and radiolaria and carbon molecules helped us devise the most efficient structural solution using hexagons and pentagons.
So we started exploring this material called ETFE.
So that was a factor-100 saving.
And with less overall weight in the superstructure , there were big savings in the foundations.
So for instance , you could develop super-efficient roof structures based on giant Amazon water lilies , whole buildings inspired by abalone shells , super-lightweight bridges inspired by plant cells.
Nature works very differently.
And in their area they had a lot of shops and restaurants that were producing lots of food , cardboard and plastic waste.
So they were paid to collect it from the restaurants.
So it transformed a linear process into a closed-loop model , and it created more value in the process.
And particularly in cities -- we could look at the whole metabolism of cities , and look at those as opportunities.
We ' d have a water treatment system treating wastewater , turning that into fresh water and generating energy from the solids using just plants and micro-organisms.
And just for fun , we ' ve proposed this for a roundabout in central London , which at the moment is a complete eyesore.
It may come as a surprise to some of you to hear that quite large areas of what are currently desert were actually forested a fairly short time ago.
The more vegetation we lose , the more that ' s likely to exacerbate climate change and lead to further desertification.
The way it does this is it comes out at night , crawls to the top of a sand dune , and because it ' s got a matte black shell , is able to radiate heat out to the night sky and become slightly cooler than its surroundings.
Because if you look closely at the beetle ' s shell , there are lots of little bumps on that shell.
So even when there ' s only a small amount of moisture in the air , it ' s able to harvest that very effectively and channel it down to its mouth.
So inside it ' s cool and humid , which means the plants need less water to grow.
This photograph was taken on completion day , and just one year later , it looked like that.
But actually in mature ecosystems , you ' re just as likely to find examples of symbiotic relationships.
So our energy problems are not intractable.
That ' s exactly what the Seawater Greenhouse produces.
So this is how this scheme would look.
And with biomimicry , if you ' ve got an underutilized resource , you don ' t think ,  " How am I going to dispose of this ?  " 
And that builds up on the evaporators -- and that ' s what that image on the left is -- gradually getting encrusted with the calcium carbonate.
You can also compress that into a building block , as they did here.
So it should be possible to extract valuable elements like lithium for high-performance batteries.
We could evaporate it to enhance the restorative benefits and capture the salts , transforming an urgent waste problem into a big opportunity.
And I firmly believe that studying the way nature solves problems will provide a lot of the solutions.
And this is an important point.
http://www.ted.com/talks/stephen_wolfram_computing_a_theory_of_everything.html
Stephen Wolfram : Computing a theory of everything
Now , of course , that idea has brought us all of the computer technology we have today and so on.
So I started off at a young age as a physicist using computers as tools.
Well , I have to admit , actually , that I also had a very selfish reason for building Mathematica : I wanted to use it myself , a bit like Galileo got to use his telescope 400 years ago.
Here ' s a representation of a really simple program.
Now we get another result , still very simple.
So the question is : Can anything else happen ? 
They ' re called cellular automata.
So here it is.
This science is different , more general , than the mathematics-based science that we ' ve had for the past 300 or so years.
It also brings up new issues , though , like computational irreducibility.
It doesn ' t take lots of technology or biological evolution to be able to do arbitrary computation ; just something that happens , naturally , all over the place.
Well , ever since I was a kid , I ' d been thinking about systematizing knowledge and somehow making it computable.
So , it ' s been a big , very complex project , which I was not sure was going to work at all.
So let ' s give it a try.
So far so good.
Let ' s say -- I don ' t know -- what ' s the GDP of Spain ? 
The idea is that we can just type this in , this kind of question in , however we think of it.
So let ' s type that in , and now Wolfram Alpha will go and use available public health data and try and figure out what part of the population that corresponds to and so on.
It ' s got , by now , pretty good coverage of everything you might find in a standard reference library.
For a start , one has to curate a zillion different sources of facts and data , and we built quite a pipeline of Mathematica automation and human domain experts for doing this.
So far , there are about 8 million lines of Mathematica code in Wolfram Alpha built by experts from many , many different fields.
And , of course , now with Wolfram Alpha actually out in the wild , we can learn from its actual usage.
So , I ' m pretty pleased with it all.
You know , I ' ve realized that Wolfram Alpha actually gives one a whole new kind of computing that one can call knowledge-based computing , in which one ' s starting not just from raw computation , but from a vast amount of built-in knowledge.
Let me show you a couple of examples here.
If you go on , that ' s a slightly more complicated program that ' s now doing all sorts of algorithmic things and creating user interface and so on.
So what happens when you put these things together ? 
You can also just sort of give vague input and then try and have Wolfram Alpha figure out what you ' re talking about.
Then , the idea is that Wolfram Alpha will be able to figure out what precise pieces of code can do what they ' re asking for and then show them examples that will let them pick what they need to build up bigger and bigger , precise programs.
This is just an example of one of these computable documents.
So , with physical materials , we ' re used to going around the world and discovering that particular materials are useful for particular technological purposes.
Something like Rule 30 , for example , turns out to be a really good randomness generator.
In a sense , we can use the computational universe to get mass customized creativity.
Well , the history of physics would have us believe that the rule for the universe must be pretty complicated.
But in at least a large class of cases , one can think of the universe as being like some kind of network , which , when it gets big enough , behaves like continuous space in much the same way as having lots of molecules can behave like a continuous fluid.
Some of these are hopeless universes , completely sterile , with other kinds of pathologies like no notion of space , no notion of time , no matter , other problems like that.
A few years ago , I was pretty excited to discover that there are candidate universes with incredibly simple rules that successfully reproduce special relativity , and even general relativity and gravitation , and at least give hints of quantum mechanics.
One ' s got to build a lot of technology.
But I ' ll tell you , here today , that I ' m committed to seeing this project done , to see if , within this decade , we can finally hold in our hands the rule for our universe and know where our universe lies in the space of all possible universes ...
It ' s taken us a long way already , but there ' s so much more to come.
So , that was , fair to say , an astonishing talk.
My guess is that some great simplifications of what I ' m doing may actually have considerable resonance with what ' s been done in string theory , but that ' s a complicated math thing that I don ' t yet know how it ' s going to work out.
SW : I think so.
I think things like the Rule 30 cellular automaton get us to a different level.
http://www.ted.com/talks/frederick_balagadde_bio_lab_on_a_microchip.html
Frederick Balagadde : Bio-lab on a microchip
We also see that this region has the least capability in terms of dealing with the disease.
But there is a fundamental problem that is killing the efforts in fighting this disease , because if you keep throwing drugs out at people who don ' t have diagnostic services , you end up creating a problem of drug resistance.
I experienced this firsthand as a high school student in Uganda.
We all know about the miracle of miniaturization.
The good news is that the same technology that allowed miniaturization of electronics is now allowing us to miniaturize biological laboratories.
A close look at how the technology works : These are channels that are about the size of a human hair -- so you have integrated valves , pumps , mixers and injectors -- so you can fit entire diagnostic experiments onto a microfluidic system.
And this is only done in four hours , 50 times faster than the current state of the art , at a cost that will be five to 500 times cheaper than the current options.
Kakenya Ntaiya made a deal with her father : She would undergo the traditional Maasai rite of passage of female circumcision if he would let her go to high school . Ntaiya tells the fearless story of continuing on to college , and of working with her village elders to build a school for girls in her community . It’s the educational journey of one that altered the destiny of 125 young women.
There ' s a group of people in Kenya.
And they kill lions.
The Maasais , the boys are brought up to be warriors.
Cool , yeah ? 
I went to school not because the Maasais '  women or girls were going to school.
He came home once a year.
She reared the cows and the goats so that she can care for us.
When I went to school , I had a dream.
I found out later that they are uncomfortable , but I admired it.
In our tradition , there is a ceremony that girls have to undergo to become women , and it ' s a rite of passage to womanhood.
Well , my dream of becoming a teacher will not come to pass.
The reason why , if I ran away , my father will have a stigma , people will be calling him the father of that girl who didn ' t go through the ceremony.
It ' s a whole week long of excitement.
We walked out to the courtyard , and there were a bunch of people waiting.
I was the first . There were my sisters and a couple of other girls , and as I approached her , she looked at me , and I sat down.
As you can imagine , I bled . I bled.
I was lucky because one , also , my mom did something that most women don ' t do.
I was so determined to be a teacher now so that I could make a difference in my family.
There is something about clothes , I think , and shoes.
Don ' t you have a husband waiting for you ?  " 
While I was in high school also , my dad was sick.
So the news came , I applied to school and I was accepted to Randolph-Macon Woman ' s College in Lynchburg , Virginia , and I couldn ' t come without the support of the village , because I needed to raise money to buy the air ticket.
So I went back and I had to go back to the tradition.
So I went to him very early in the morning , as the sun rose.
I promised him that I would be the best girl , I will come back , anything they wanted after that , I will do it for them.
The village , the women , the men , everybody came together to support me to come to get an education.
I was in a land of plenty.
I learned that I did not have to trade part of my body to get an education . I had a right.
Those things made me angry.
I had to do something.
And the reason they wanted the school for girls is because when a girl is raped when she ' s walking to school , the mother is blamed for that.
As we moved , and I went to talk to the fathers , the fathers , of course , you can imagine what they said :  " We want a school for boys. " 
And I told them , I wanted them to show me a sign of commitment.
Angeline came to apply for the school , and she did not meet any criteria that we had.
And I looked at her , I remember that day , and I saw something beyond what I was seeing in Angeline.
A transformation had begun in her life.
That ' s Sharon . That ' s five years later.
One hundred twenty-five girls will not be married when they ' re 12 years old.
I want to challenge you today.
You are somebody who wants to see that war ends , no poverty.
Be the first . People will follow you.
And we will live in a very peaceful world . Thank you very much.

And I asked myself , why ? 
I ' m fortunate enough to work in the rehab facility , so I get to see people who are facing life and death with addiction.
So my question is , why don ' t we ask for the things that we need ? 
And he goes ,  " Oh , this is great , this is great. " 
So , the question is , why was I blocking it ? 
I ' m telling you where I ' m insecure.
You could neglect me.
The guy said ,  " You know , when you true the wheels , it ' s going to make the bike so much better. " 
What do you need to hear ?  Go home to your wife -- go ask her , what does she need ? 
And why should we care about this ? 
So , let ' s make it right in our own backyard.
http://www.ted.com/talks/john_gerzema_the_post_crisis_consumer.html
John Gerzema : The post-crisis consumer
We ' ve looked at our government oversight.
And the idea is a simple , simple idea , which is the fact that the consumer has moved from a state of anxiety to action.
In order to understand this , we ' re going to step back and look a little bit at what ' s happened over the course of the last year and a half.
If you ' re a mom trying to manage a budget , and oil was 150 dollars a barrel last summer , and it ' s somewhere between 50 and 70 , do you plan vacations ?  How do you buy ? 
In fact , let ' s go back and look at what caused this crisis , because the consumer , all of us , in our daily lives , actually contributed a large part to the problem.
This was World War II . Do you know why savings was so high ? 
All these things together basically created a factor where the consumer sort of drove us headlong into the crisis that we face today.
This is an absolutely staggering chart.
But if you stack it up , you just see this amazing , staggering amount of dollars that have been put into the system to fund and bail us out.
They are taking responsibility.
Also , remarkably , in the fourth quarter , spending dropped to its lowest level in 62 years , almost a 3.7 percent decline.
But that ' s not really the whole story.
If you take into account 80 percent of all Americans were born after World War II , this is essentially our Depression.
And so there is an increase in people having to have their fillings replaced.
Does anybody know why ? 
If you think about the last three decades , the consumer has moved from savvy about marketing in the  ' 90s , to gathering all these amazing social and search tools in this decade , but the one thing that has been holding them back is the ability to discriminate.
We found a couple of really interesting things.
As a result , déclassé consumption is in.
First things is we see something must be happening when P . Diddy vows to tone down his bling.
We also see just a relaxing of ego , and sort of a dismantling of artifice.
Agritourism , going to vineyards and going to farms.
One is that Frito-Lay figured out this liquidity thing with their consumer.
They ' ve just instituted dynamic pricing.
Again , this theme is about variable cost , variable living.
The second of the four values is this movement toward ethics and fair play.
Increasingly , consumers are looking at the culture of the company , looking for their conduct in the marketplace.
Also a wonderful byproduct of sort of a really lousy thing , which has been unemployment , is a rise in volunteerism that ' s been noted in our country.
So , from a value and values standpoint , what companies can do is connect in lots of different ways.
Gore-Tex is all about personal accountability of their management and their employees , to the point where they really kind of shun the idea of bosses.
The third of the four laws of post-crisis consumerism is about durable living.
We also see the fact that libraries have become a huge resource for America.
Continuing education is up.
That includes cottages and the like . But 30 percent.
And then we look at the High Line in New York City , an excellent use of reimagining existing infrastructure for something good , which is a brand new park in New York City.
Another great example is Fidelity.
So , it ' s a consumer driven co-op.
It ' s now about connecting to your communities , connecting to your social networks.
Let ' s look at a couple of quick examples.
Realizing that it ' s difficult to get loans in this environment , you ' re doing business with people you trust , in your local markets.
And what they found out is when that was available for public record , the people ' s electricity usage in those communities dropped.
Have a stick ?  Well why not have a carrot ? 
You have to realize that you can ' t fight and control this.
First is just the rise of the fact that Zagat ' s has actually moved out of and diversified from rating restaurants , into actually rating healthcare.
Then you look at the phenomenon of Kogi.
A phenomenal blog that ' s been built up.
You see this rising force in sort of total transparency and openness that companies are starting to adopt , all because the consumer is demanding it.
And the Chinese character for crisis is actually the same side of the same coin.
It will drive innovation.
http://www.ted.com/talks/elif_shafak_the_politics_of_fiction.html
Elif Shafak : The politics of fiction
I will do so with the help of words , of course , but also a geometrical shape , the circle , so throughout my talk , you will come across several circles.
Now in the early 1970s , in Ankara , that was a bit unusual.
On the other hand was my grandmother , who also took care of me and was more spiritual , less educated and definitely less rational.
Then one by one , she would encircle these thorns with dark ink.
In response she said ,  " Yes , praying is effective , but also beware of the power of circles. " 
We all do.
Our friends , neighbors , colleagues , family -- if all the people in our inner circle resemble us , it means we are surrounded with our mirror image.
And it ' s happening everywhere , among liberals and conservatives , agnostics and believers , the rich and the poor , East and West alike.
And through those holes , we can get a glimpse of the other , and sometimes even like what we see.
I was constantly telling stories at home , which was good , except I told this to imaginary friends around me , which was not so good.
And thus began my life-long passion for writing fiction.
My mother became a diplomat.
Instead , it generated an atmosphere in which each child was seen -- not as an individual on his own , but as the representative of something larger.
I skipped school often and dreamed of becoming a sailor during those days.
After Spain , we went to Jordan , Germany and Ankara again.
I lived in a very vibrant , diverse neighborhood where I wrote several of my novels.
He was sitting next to a transvestite with a long black wig and mascara running down her cheeks.
I ' m not saying that fiction has the magnitude of an earthquake , but when we are reading a good novel , we leave our small , cozy apartments behind , go out into the night alone and start getting to know people we had never met before and perhaps had even been biased against.
I ' m not an immigrant , refugee or exile -- they ask me why I do this -- but the commute between languages gives me the chance to recreate myself.
When you ' re a latecomer to a language , what happens is you live there with a continuous and perpetual frustration.
And this is what I discovered in Boston -- that frustration was very stimulating.
And since my husband is in Istanbul , I started commuting between Arizona and Istanbul -- the two places on the surface of earth that couldn ' t be more different.
And this is a subject that I would love to think about together.
He said ,  " Well , look at it . There ' s so many Spanish , American , Hispanic characters in it , but there ' s only one Turkish character and it ' s a man. " 
He was looking for a Turkish woman in the book because I happened to be one.
You ' re expected to write informative , poignant and characteristic stories and leave the experimental and avant-garde to your Western colleagues.
The writer and commuter James Baldwin gave an interview in 1984 in which he was repeatedly asked about his homosexuality.
I never forget my first multicultural reading , in Harvard Square about 10 years ago.
Multicultural writers are expected to tell real stories , not so much the imaginary.
It comes from everywhere.
Some people criticized , others praised me for writing about the Turkish-Armenian conflict.
I want to love and celebrate fiction for what it is , not as a means to an end.
Identity politics divides us . Fiction connects.
The other recognizes no frontiers.
They would go to coffee houses , where they would tell a story in front of an audience , often improvising.
Today , stories continue to transcend borders.
Books have saved the introverted , timid child that I was -- that I once was.
The problem with today ' s cultural ghettos is not lack of knowledge -- we know a lot about each other , or so we think -- but knowledge that takes us not beyond ourselves : it makes us elitist , distant and disconnected.
Like that , my fiction as well.
In the palace , just outside the quarters of the favorite concubines , there ' s an area called The Gathering Place of the Djinn.
We see them as the domain of supernatural creatures like the djinn , who are made of smokeless fire and are the symbol of elusiveness.
I like it when my characters surprise me.
I think it was a wonderful paradigm shift.
We should teach young people and ourselves to expand our hearts and write what we can feel.
And I would like to finish with an old Sufi poem :  " Come , let us be friends for once ; let us make life easy on us ; let us be lovers and loved ones ; the earth shall be left to no one. " 
1535
He ' s been christened the voice of a generation , and he ' s churning out classic songs at a seemingly impossible rate , but there ' s a small minority of dissenters , and they claim that Bob Dylan is stealing other people ' s songs.
It is new media created from old media.
I think these are the basic elements of all creativity.
All right , this first song you ' re going to hear is  " Nottamun Town. "  It ' s a traditional folk tune.
Last one , this is  " Who ' s Going To Buy You Ribbons, "  another traditional folk tune.
It ' s been estimated that two thirds of the melodies Dylan used in his early songs were borrowed.
Don ' t worry about tunes . Take a tune , sing high when they sing low , sing fast when they sing slow , and you ' ve got a new tune. " 
That is  " When the World ' s on Fire, "  a very old melody , in this case performed by the Carter Family.
Instead , these laws and laws around the world use the rather awkward analogy of property.
Progress happens when all the factors that make for it are ready and then it is inevitable. " 
Here is Steve Jobs introducing multi-touch and making a rather foreboding joke.
This is at TED , actually , about a year earlier.
Jeff Han : Multi-touch sensing isn ' t anything -- isn ' t completely new . I mean , people like Bill Buxton have been playing around with it in the  ' 80s.
It ' s the small parts of it that are , and it ' s in these small details where we can clearly see patent law contradicting its intent : to promote the progress of useful arts.
I ' m only exaggerating a little bit . It ' s a broad patent.
Would a young and inexperienced Apple have survived the legal assault from a much larger and more mature company like Xerox ? 
He said ,  " Good artists copy . Great artists steal. " 
 " I ' m willing to go thermonuclear war on this. " 
So here ' s the sort of equation we ' re looking at.
Is this promoting the progress of useful arts ? 
I think this is mostly what we do.
Thank you so much . It was an honor to be here.

And one of the first victims of difficult economic times , I think , is public spending of any kind , but certainly in the firing line at the moment is public spending for science , and particularly curiosity-led science and exploration.
And it ' s actually a beautiful demonstration of how much science costs.
You see there , it ' s about 620 billion a year.
That funds everything in the U.K.
R&D in total in the economy , publicly funded , is about 0.6 percent of GDP.
So it isn ' t in the series.
It ' s about 500 kilometers in diameter.
What ' s beautiful is , you can probably see on the limb there some faint , sort of , wisps of almost smoke rising up from the limb.
That ' s fascinating and beautiful in itself , but we think that the mechanism for powering those fountains requires there to be lakes of liquid water beneath the surface of this moon.
Well , let me just say , that was a graphic . I just want to show this picture.
And so this , again , a real picture of the ice fountains rising up into space , absolutely beautiful.
It ' s actually an ice moon.
It could be hundreds of kilometers deep , we think.
Our exploration of the solar system has taught us that the solar system is beautiful.
This is a very famous picture taken , actually , on my first Christmas Eve , December 24th , 1968 , when I was about eight months old.
The reason many people think that about this picture , and Al Gore has said it many times , actually , on the stage at TED , is that this picture , arguably , was the beginning of the environmental movement.
Well , actually , many studies have been done about the economic effectiveness , the economic impact of Apollo.
So exploration can pay for itself.
What it is , is a picture of the spectrum of hydrogen.
Now that led to an understanding of atomic structure because the way that ' s explained is atoms are a single nucleus with electrons going around them.
I just wanted to show this picture because this is remarkable.
But look at the number of black lines in that spectrum.
Now , that sounds esoteric , and indeed it was an esoteric pursuit , but the quantum theory quickly led to an understanding of the behaviors of electrons in materials like silicon , for example.
In  " Wonders of the Solar System, "  we kept emphasizing the laws of physics are universal.
You can work it out on a piece of paper in a laboratory , get a telescope , swing it to the sky , and you find that there are no dead stars bigger than 1.4 times the mass of the Sun.
This is the picture of a galaxy , a common  " our garden "  galaxy with , what , 100 billion stars like our Sun in it.
But that bright star there is actually one of the stars in the galaxy.
Now that ' s an incredible phenomena , because it ' s a star that sits there.
And what it does is it sucks gas off its companion star , until it gets to this limit called the Chandrasekhar limit , and then it explodes.
And there was no carbon and oxygen in the universe throughout the first generation of stars.
Now , the explorers of the world of the atom did not intend to invent the transistor.
It can also , I think , finally reveal the most profound ideas to us about our place in the universe and really the value of our home planet.
It was taken by the Cassini space probe.
It was a picture of Earth captured in that frame of Saturn.
It was taken by this thing , which is called the Voyager spacecraft.
But it visited Jupiter , Saturn , Uranus and Neptune.
That ' s Earth from four billion miles away.
On it , everyone you love , everyone you know , everyone you ' ve ever heard of , every human being who ever was lived out their lives.
To me , it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot , the only home we ' ve ever known. " 
You could have made it in the 1890s ; you wouldn ' t have the transistor.
Let me leave the last words to someone who ' s rapidly becoming a hero of mine , Humphrey Davy , who did his science at the turn of the 19th century.
He said this , he said ,  " Nothing is more fatal to the progress of the human mind than to presume that our views of science are ultimate , that our triumphs are complete , that there are no mysteries in nature , and that there are no new worlds to conquer. " 
755
This is 26th , that ' s 27th. " 
He leaves , a little confused and disappointed.
And they say ,  " Well , streets don ' t have names.
And you say then ,  " OK , then how do you know your home address ?  " 
He says ,  " Of course they do . They go in the order in which they were built.
So , I love that sometimes we need to go to the opposite side of the world to realize assumptions we didn ' t even know we had , and realize that the opposite of them may also be true.
But in West African music , the  " one "  is thought of as the end of the phrase , like the period at the end of a sentence.
So , let ' s never forget , whether at TED , or anywhere else , that whatever brilliant ideas you have or hear , that the opposite may also be true.
activism,environment,global issues
And I say  " thank you for being here "  because I was silent for 17 years.
My mother , out in the audience , she jumped up ,  " Hallelujah , Johnny’s talking! " 
I hadn’t heard my voice in 17 years , so I turned around and I looked and I said ,  " God , who ' s saying what I’m thinking ?  " 
And the journey , I believe , is a metaphor for all of our journeys.
That’s a big thing in California.
And I’d say ,  " Well , I’m walking for the environment. " 
Because of the oil , everybody talked about the polllution.
My dad said ,  " Why didn’t you do that when you were 16 ?  " 
She said ,  " If you were happy , son , you wouldn’t have to say it. " 
I got up in the morning and I didn’t say a word.
And in my mind , I just kind of raced ahead and thought of what I was going to say back , while they were still finishing up.
And it was very sad for me , because I realized that for those many years I had not been learning.
So for a year I said I would keep quiet , and then on my birthday I would reassess what I had learned and maybe I would talk again.
I walked up to Ashland , Oregon , where they were offering an environmental studies degree.
 " Oh , so you really want to go to school here ? 
And my father came out , he was so proud.
I walked all the way up to Port Townsend , Washington , where I built a wooden boat , rode it across Puget Sound and walked across Washington [to] Idaho and down to Missoula , Montana.
There are two stories in Montana.
He gave me 150 dollars , and he said ,  " Register for one credit.
He came back ; he said to me ,  " OK John , now that you ' ve registered for that one credit , you can have a key to an office , you can matriculate -- you’re matriculating , so you can use the library.
But I use that story because they really wanted to help me.
I explained , with a friend who could interpret my sign language , that I was John Francis , I was walking around the world , I didn’t talk and this was the last time this person’s going to be here interpreting for me.
Two weeks later , everyone was trying to get into our class.
 " No , no , no , that ' s not clear cutting , that’s -- he ' s using a handsaw. " 
Now this was a discussion class and we were having a discussion.
And so I went on.
I spent two years there writing on oil spills.
My dad came out again.
I put my banjo on and I walked all the way to the East Coast , put my foot in the Atlantic Ocean -- it was seven years and one day it took me to walk across the United States.
And I’m thanking you , and I ' m thanking my family because they had come to hear me speak.
Really , very important -- we need to listen to each other.
I wrote regulations for the United States -- I mean , I wrote oil spill regulations.
And as I walked off a little bit , they ' d say ,  " Yeah , and shut up , too. " 
Well , my time at the Coast Guard was a really good time.
I started talking because I had studied environment.
Because if we are the environment , then all we need to do is look around us and see how we treat ourselves and how we treat each other.
This is the last part of this story , because it’s how I got here , because I still didn ' t ride in motorized vehicles.
I don ' t need to show you my passport . It’s in the back of my pack.
The road turned into the jungle.
It took me 100 miles to figure out that , in my heart , in me , I had become a prisoner.
Because when I started , it seemed very appropriate to me not to use motorized vehicles.
And so I realized that I had a responsibility to more than just me , and that I was going to have to change.
I was so used to that person that I didn’t want to stop.
And I know that a lot of times we find ourselves in this wonderful place where we’ve gotten to , but there’s another place for us to go.
As our former Vice President said , we have to become activists.
Because we are the environment , and how we treat each other is really how we’re going to treat the environment.
children,education,food,science,writing
And in that spirit , I want to spring on you all a pop quiz.
Or maybe you ' ve called to mind the toddler phase when children are learning how to walk and talk and use a fork.
And that is that some of the most important learning we ever do happens before we ' re born , while we ' re still in the womb.
And those two roles came together for me in a book that I wrote called  " Origins. " 
I was myself pregnant while I was doing the research for the book.
First of all , they learn the sound of their mothers '  voices.
And because the fetus is with her all the time , it hears her voice a lot.
Researchers take advantage of this fact by rigging up two rubber nipples , so that if a baby sucks on one , it hears a recording of its mother ' s voice on a pair of headphones , and if it sucks on the other nipple , it hears a recording of a female stranger ' s voice.
My favorite experiment of this kind is the one that showed that the babies of women who watched a certain soap opera every day during pregnancy recognized the theme song of that show once they were born.
Now why would this kind of fetal learning be useful ? 
But it ' s not just sounds that fetuses are learning about in utero.
Babies seem to remember and prefer these tastes once they ' re out in the world.
A sort of French version of this experiment was carried out in Dijon , France where researchers found that mothers who consumed food and drink flavored with licorice-flavored anise during pregnancy showed a preference for anise on their first day of life , and again , when they were tested later , on their fourth day of life.
They ' re being introduced to the characteristic flavors and spices of their culture ' s cuisine even before birth.
But actually , the nine-month-long process of molding and shaping that goes on in the womb is a lot more visceral and consequential than that.
And often it does something more.
Will it be safe and protected , or will it face constant dangers and threats ? 
To conclude , I want to tell you two stories about how mothers teach their children about the world even before they ' re born.
As weeks of deprivation stretched into months , some resorted to eating tulip bulbs.
The  " Hunger Winter, "  as it came to be known , killed some 10,000 people and weakened thousands more.
Decades after the  " Hunger Winter, "  researchers documented that people whose mothers were pregnant during the siege have more obesity , more diabetes and more heart disease in later life than individuals who were gestated under normal conditions.
One explanation is that fetuses are making the best of a bad situation.
It seems that fetuses are taking cues from the intrauterine environment and tailoring their physiology accordingly.
The meals a pregnant woman consumes constitute a kind of story , a fairy tale of abundance or a grim chronicle of deprivation.
This is what happened to the children of the Dutch  " Hunger Winter. " 
Here ' s another story.
About a year after 9/11 , researchers examined a group of women who were pregnant when they were exposed to the World Trade Center attack.
But there ' s another way of thinking about PTSD.
It would mean that , even before birth , mothers are warning their children that it ' s a wild world out there , telling them ,  " Be careful. " 
That important effort must include a focus on what fetuses learn during the nine months they spend in the womb.
art,design,entertainment,illusion,magic,technology
Today ' s its debut.
I like to think of it as a kind of technological magic.
It seems the perfect medium to investigate magic and ask , why , in a technological age , we continue to have this magical sense of wonder.
Samuel Taylor Coleridge : I try to convey a semblance of truth in my writing to produce for these shadows of the imagination a willing suspension of disbelief that , for a moment , constitutes poetic faith.
And sleight of hand is just an artful demonstration of dexterity.
Without this ability there is no magic.
He is an actor playing the part of a magician.
Now many of them are intensely dramatic.
The tricks of magic have one special element.
Edward de Bono : Stage magic relies almost wholly on the momentum error.
But when the scenario we have imagined suddenly flips into something entirely unexpected , we laugh.
One of the key qualities of all stories is that they ' re made to be shared.
That makes my job more difficult , because , if I want to surprise them , I need to tell a story that starts the same , but ends differently -- a trick with a twist on a twist.
We connect events and emotions and instinctively transform them into a sequence that can be easily understood.
The tools of social networking , these are the digital campfires around which the audience gathers to hear our story.
They give us our identity and a sense of community.

We ' re three brothers from New Jersey , and the funny thing is that , believe it or not , we are hooked on bluegrass and we ' re excited to play it for you tonight.
This is my brother , Jonny . He ' s 10 , and he plays the banjo.
JM : Thank you all.

One of them was : Why is it necessary to spend six billion pounds speeding up the Eurostar train when , for about 10 percent of that money , you could have top supermodels , male and female , serving free Chateau Petrus to all the passengers for the entire duration of the journey ? 
So there seems to be a complete disconnect here.
You may remember this as the AOL-Time Warner merger , okay , heralded at the time as the largest single deal of all time.
So unless you happened to be a shareholder of one or the other organizations or one of the dealmakers or lawyers involved in the no-doubt lucrative activity , you ' re actually engaging in a huge piece of activity that meant absolutely bugger-all to anybody , okay ? 
What ' s really , really sweet is every single person looking at these things has exactly the same mischievous thought , which is ,  " I reckon I can heist these. " 
Has anybody stayed there ? 
It actually says garage , funk , rhythm and blues.
Now , these are trivial marketing examples , I accept.
But secondly , to incentivize that inoculation by giving a kilo of lentils to everybody who participated.
Our own sense of self-aggrandizement feels that big important problems need to have big important , and most of all , expensive solutions attached to them.
And once you have a very , very large budget , you actually look for expensive things to spend it on.
You come out of  " Arrive "  at the airport , and you follow a big yellow sign that says  " Trains "  and it ' s in front of you.
A yellow sign ?  That ' s exactly what they ' ll be expecting.
One of them also being , although logically it ' s quite a good idea to have a lift with no up and down button in it , if it only serves two floors , it ' s actually bloody terrifying , okay ? 
But also , there seems to be a complete sort of gridlock in terms of solving these small solutions.
What can we do and encourage more online banking ?  " 
I ' ve got friends who actually never use their own bank cash machines because there ' s the risk that it might display their balance on the screen.
Let ' s face it , most of us -- how many of you actually check your balance before you remove cash from a cash machine ? 
And yet , it never happens.
Because , if the board of directors convince everybody that the success of any organization is almost entirely dependent on the decisions made by the board of directors , it makes the disparity in salaries slightly more justifiable than if you actually acknowledge that quite a lot of the credit for a company ' s success might actually lie somewhere else , in small pieces of tactical activity.
That ' s the world people actually want.
But what I ' m saying is we could just make things a little bit better for ourselves if we looked at it in this very simple four-way approach.
Moving over , we come , of course , to consultancy.
So what Accenture suddenly found so unattractive about that , I ' m not sure.
And the fundamental problem is we don ' t actually have a word for this stuff.
And the second thing , I think , is that the world needs to have people in charge of that.
And if actually we created a Ministry of Detail and business actually had Chief Detail Officers , then that fourth quadrant , which is so woefully neglected at the moment , might finally get the attention it deserves.

As a child studying these eternal masterpieces , Bach ' s music would intermingle with the singing voices of Muslim prayers from the neighboring Arab village of the northern Kibbutz in Israel where I grew up.
I still start every day practicing playing Bach.
The excitement of a great orchestra performance comes from the attempt to have a collective of musicians producing one unified whole concept.
I hope to arrive at new territories to discover sounds I have never heard before.
Building sophisticated educational tools out of cheap parts , Johnny Lee demos his cool Wii Remote hacks , which turn the $40 video game controller into a digital whiteboard , a touchscreen and a head-mounted 3-D viewer.
So , as researchers , something that we often do is use immense resources to achieve certain capabilities , or achieve certain goals.
And I ' m going to show you two videos that have gotten a lot of attention recently that I think embody this philosophy.
But what actually interests me a lot more is the fact that in the tip of each controller is a relatively high-performing infrared camera.
So what I ' m going to show you how to do is how to create one with a Wii remote.
Now , what this means is that if I run this piece of software , the camera sees the infrared dot , and I can register the location of the camera pixels to the projector pixels . And now this is like a whiteboard surface.
And in the three months that this project has been public , it ' s been downloaded over half a million times.
Another nice thing is that a camera can see multiple dots , so this is actually a multi-touch , interactive whiteboard system as well.
And why this is interesting is I have this sort of application running on the computer monitor , which has a 3D room , with some targets floating in it.
So this has actually been a little bit startling to the game development community.
But actually , to me , what ' s almost more interesting than either of these two products is how people actually found out about them.

Stephen Hawking asks big questions about the universe
Are we alone in the universe ? 
Then it was discovered that the universe was expanding.
This was the Big Bang , the beginning of the universe.
We used to think that the theory of the universe could be divided into two parts.
But until recently , we have had little idea about the initial conditions for the universe.
The universe can spontaneously create itself out of nothing.
Maybe we should patent the universe and charge everyone royalties for their existence.
We have two pieces of observational evidence on the probability of life appearing.
This suggests that a probability of life appearing is reasonably high.
Why would they appear only to cranks and weirdoes ? 
Issuing an insurance policy against abduction by aliens seems a pretty safe bet.
Our population and our use of the finite resources of planet Earth are growing exponentially , along with our technical ability to change the environment for good or ill.
The answers to these big questions show that we have made remarkable progress in the last hundred years.
I have been very lucky that my disability has not been a serious handicap.
Chris Anderson : Professor , if you had to guess either way , do you now believe that it is more likely than not that we are alone in the Milky Way , as a civilization of our level of intelligence or higher ? 
CA : Professor Hawking , thank you for that answer.
http://www.ted.com/talks/jessica_jackley_poverty_money_and_love.html
Jessica Jackley : Poverty , money -- and love
I was six years old when I first heard stories about the poor.
This is what Jesus asked of us.
And also , it was kind of interesting that God needed help.
So I felt confused , a little bit frustrated and angry , like maybe I ' d misunderstood something here.
They were always going to ask me to help them and give them things , which I was excited to do , but I didn ' t know how it was going to work.
I heard about things that were going wrong in the lives of the poor.
I started to feel guilty for my own relative wealth , because I wasn ' t doing more , apparently , to make things better.
And I stopped expecting things to really change.
I mean who can argue with that ? 
I was purchasing something -- I was buying my right to go on with my day and not necessarily be bothered by this bad news.
I think that exchange can actually get in the way of the very thing that we want most.
When I heard him speak , it was three years before that.
He also talked about , in particular , microlending , which is a tiny loan that could help someone start or grow a business.
In fact , those individuals he talked about who were poor was sort of a side note.
And I , in fact , was so deeply moved by this -- it ' s hard to express now how much that affected me -- but I was so moved that I actually quit my job a few weeks later , and I moved to East Africa to try to see for myself what this was about.
I was starting to be friends and get to know their personal stories.
They would make a little bit more money ; their standard of living would shift and would get better.
Maybe it was just that they could put sugar in their tea and offer that to me when I came as their guest and that made them feel proud.
Because the best way for people to change their lives is for them to have control and to do that in a way that they believe is best for them.
There ' s poverty , you give money to help -- no one asked me for a donation.
And by the way , I was a philosophy and poetry major in school , so I didn ' t know the difference between profit and revenue when I went to East Africa.
So this idea that these new stories of business and hope might be shared with my friends and family , and through that , maybe we could get some of the money that they needed to be able to continue their businesses as loans , that ' s this little idea that turned into Kiva.
We sent it over to Uganda.
Let ' s start for real. "  That was our official launch.
The fourth year , we were just short of 100.
It ' s about retelling the story of the poor , and it ' s about giving ourselves an opportunity to engage that validates their dignity , validates a partnership relationship , not a relationship that ' s based on the traditional sort of donor beneficiary weirdness that can happen.
Because as that happens , I think we can feel free to interact in a way that ' s more open , more just and more creative , to engage with each other and to help each other.
Imagine if you ' re speaking with somebody who ' s growing things and making them flourish , somebody who ' s using their talents to do something productive , somebody who ' s built their own business from scratch , someone who is surrounded by abundance , not scarcity , who ' s in fact creating abundance , somebody with full hands with something to offer , not empty hands asking for you to give them something.
Now for me , Kiva is just the beginning.
And I think , at its core , it ' s deciding that you want your life to be better.
So they ' re not a donation.
This continued attention -- this ongoing attention -- is a really big deal to build different kinds of relationships among us.
I see entrepreneurs everywhere now , now that I ' m tuned into this.
As I ' ve researched what ' s going on in the United States , a few interesting little insights have come up.
Some statistics say 85 percent or more of funding for small businesses comes from friends and family.
And it ' s investments , not donations , not loans , but investments that have a dynamic return.
We make it really , really simple for me as well as anyone else who wants to use the site.
So they can be a cash , or a cause , investor.
Right now , Profounder ' s right at the very beginning , and it ' s very palpable ; it ' s very clear to me , that it ' s just a vessel , it ' s just a tool.
I don ' t think we need to be convinced of that . I think we know ; in fact , I think we know so much , and it ' s such a reality that we care so deeply , that in fact , what usually stops us is that we ' re afraid to try and to mess up , because we care so very much about helping each other and being meaningful in each other ' s lives.
And I think we know that love is resilient enough for us to get out there and try.
And I ' m grateful that I ' ve gotten to do that here at TED.
Believing in each other , really being sure when push comes to shove that each one of us can do amazing things in the world , that is what can make our stories into love stories and our collective story into one that continually perpetuates hope and good things for all of us.

Look at that.

All right.
All right.
She belongs to the species known as Australopithecus afarensis.
And Selam means peace in many Ethiopian languages.
You don ' t just jump into an invitation.
And you can do the same with your genes and track them back in time.
So , for us , paleoanthropologists , our job is to find the hard evidence , the fossil evidence , to fill in this gap and see the different stages of development.
It ' s a systematic and scientific approach , which takes you to places that are remote , hot , hostile and often with no access.
I was the first person to actually drive a car to the spot.
When I go to places like this , which are paleontological sites , it ' s like going to a game park , an extinct game park.
Of course , they cannot , but I ' m telling you already that the environment and the carrying capacity of this region was drastically different from what we have today.
To tell you just an example , an anecdote about their rarity , I was going to this place every year and would do fieldwork here , and the assistants , of course , helped me do the surveys.
So one of my assistants , who never went to school , said to me ,  " Listen , Zeray.
Well , he was very tired , and it ' s really tiring.
This is the earliest and most complete juvenile human ancestor ever found in the history of paleoanthropology , an amazing piece of our long , long history.
Here is a close-up of the fossil , after five years of cleaning , preparation and description , which was very long , and I had to expose the bones from the sandstone block I just showed you in the previous slide.
And in the middle is the minister of Ethiopian tourism , who came to visit the National Museum of Ethiopia while I was working there.
We were able to tell that she belonged to the human family tree because the legs , the foot , and some features clearly showed that she walked upright , and upright walking is a hallmark in humanity.
So she belongs to our family tree , but within that , of course , you do detailed analysis , and we know now that she belongs to the Lucy species , known as Australopithecus afarensis.
How ? 
So when you measure those teeth , it was clear that she started out to be a girl with very small canine teeth.
To answer this question , we can phrase another question.
And second , she tells us that she walked upright , but had some adaptation for tree climbing.
That ' s why they can cope with their environment very easily after birth -- faster than us , anyway.
You spend more time with your parents.
But not everything was human , and I will give you a very exciting example.
It determines the type of voice you produce.
Maybe you ' re wondering ,  " So , you see this ape feature , human feature , ape feature.
Up to now , the knowledge that we had about our ancestors came essentially from adult individuals because the fossils , the baby fossils , were missing.
Can you imagine how much biased his report would be ? 
But if this species , ancient species , would travel in time and see us today , they would very much be very proud of their legacy , because they became the ancestors of the most successful species in the universe.
And can we really do better than these primitive , small-brained ancestors ? 
One is to continue to see a poor , ill , crying Africa , carrying guns , that depends on other people forever , or to promote an Africa which is confident , peaceful , independent , but cognizant of its huge problems and great values at the same time.
I think it ' s important to promote in a more positive way on how we see ourselves.
David Gallo shows jaw-dropping footage of amazing sea creatures , including a color-shifting cuttlefish , a perfectly camouflaged octopus , and a Times Square ' s worth of neon light displays from fish who live in the blackest depths of the ocean.
We ' re going to go on a dive to the deep sea , and anyone that ' s had that lovely opportunity knows that for about two and half hours on the way down , it ' s a perfectly positively pitch-black world.
There ' s a flying turkey under a tree.
there ' s a fish with glowing eyes , pulsating eyes.
Already we ' ve found the world ' s highest mountains , the world ' s deepest valleys , underwater lakes , underwater waterfalls -- a lot of that we shared with you from the stage.
Cephalopods -- head-foots . As a kid I knew them as calamari , mostly.
In the next bit , we ' re going to see a couple squid.
Let ' s take a look at it again . Watch the coloration : white on the right , brown on the left.
And there he is , his droopy little eyes up here.
Positively amazing . Here ' s two males fighting.
Here ' s an octopus . Sometimes they don ' t want to be seen when they move because predators can see them.
There ' s a good reason why : the shallow water ' s full of predators -- here ' s a barracuda -- and if you ' re an octopus or a cephalopod , you need to really understand how to use your surroundings to hide.
and an octopus . Ain ' t that amazing ?  Now , Roger spooked him so he took off in a cloud of ink , and when he lands the octopus says ,  " Oh , I ' ve been seen.
I thought it was all graphics -- so here it is in reverse.
And now he ' s gone , and so am I . Thank you very much.

It ' s a place marked on ancient maps as  " here be monsters. " 
The  " high seas "  is a legal term , but in fact , it covers 50 percent of the planet.
So today I ' m going to take you on a voyage to cast light on some of the outdated myths and legends and assumptions that have kept us as the true stakeholders in the high seas in the dark.
To me , as an international lawyer , this scared me far more than any of the creatures or the monsters we may have seen , for it belies the notion that you can actually protect the ocean , the global ocean , that provides us all with carbon storage , with heat storage , with oxygen , if you can only protect 36 percent.
As a result , we have garbage patches the size of twice-Texas.
And these include a sense of shared responsibility , common norms that bind people together as a community.
For a group of very dedicated individuals -- scientists , conservationists , photographers and states -- were able to actually change a tragic trajectory that was destroying fragile seascapes such as this coral garden that you see in front of you.
But we also spent many hours in the basements of the United Nations , trying to work with governments to make them understand what was going on so far away from land that few of us had ever even imagined that these creatures existed.
This does not mean that it ' s the final solution , or that this even provides permanent protection.
Today , we ' re just going to voyage to a small sampling of some of these special areas , just to give you an idea of the flavor of the riches and wonders they do contain.
This picture doesn ' t exactly show the plastics that I would like it to show , because I haven ' t been out there myself.
But what I ' d like to get from this picture is that we truly do have an opportunity to launch a global initiative for protection.
It ' s considered high seas , because the continent has been put off limits to territorial claims.
The captain of a New Zealand vessel who was just down there is reporting a significant decline in the number of the Ross Sea killer whales , who are directly dependent on the Antarctic toothfish as their main source of food.
But what ' s unusual about the Costa Rica Dome is , in fact , it ' s not a permanent place.
As such , it does create a challenge to protect , but we also have a challenge protecting the species that move along with it.
This is the initiative that ' s been coordinated by Conservation International with a variety of partners and governments to actually try to bring integrated management regime throughout the area.
So a place like the Costa Rica Dome could not technically qualify the time it ' s in the high seas.
So what I ' d really like to suggest is that we need to scale-up.
It ' s provided us data like this , of tiny , little sooty shearwaters that make the entire ocean basin their home.
So stay tuned for further information.
We ' ve been revealing this information through technical workshops.
Which leads me to my second passion besides ocean science , which is outer space technology.
But not all the vessels have those to date.
But we need to think broad-scale . We need to think globally.
And third is that we need to look at ocean-basin-wide management.
And in order to do that , you also need ocean-basin management regimes.
So on this tour , I hope I provided you with a new perspective of the high seas : one , that it is our home too , and that we need to work together if we are to make this a sustainable ocean future for us all.

And in the seat next to me was a high school student , a teenager , and she came from a really poor family.
So I get off the plane , and I come to TED.
And the first thing is passion.
And the interesting thing is : if you do it for love , the money comes anyway.
TED-sters do have fun working . And they work hard.
And it ' s focus . Norman Jewison said to me ,  " I think it all has to do with focusing yourself on one thing. " 
Goldie Hawn says ,  " I always had self-doubts.
Frank Gehry -- Frank Gehry said to me ,  " My mother pushed me. " 
Because that ' s the way people really get rich. " 
And I give lots of evidence.
So , the big -- the answer to this question is simple : Pay 4,000 bucks and come to TED.
Many of us have a social media presence -- a virtual personality made up of status updates , tweets and connections , stored in the cloud . Adam Ostrow asks a big question : What happens to that personality after you ' ve died ?  Could it .. . live on ? 
By the end of this year , there ' ll be nearly a billion people on this planet that actively use social networking sites.
And what Miller did was have his family and friends write a post that went out shortly after he died.
Now , while as a journalist , Miller ' s archive may have been better written and more carefully curated than most , the fact of the matter is that all of us today are creating an archive that ' s something completely different than anything that ' s been created by any previous generation.
And the average Facebook user is creating 90 pieces of content each month.
Now to be clear , I ' m a journalist and not a technologist , so what I ' d like to do briefly is paint a picture of what the present and the future are going to look like.
Death : Adam ? 
Death : Go to ifidie.net before it ' s too late.
And what this lets you do is create an online tribute to your loved ones , complete with photos and videos and stories that they can post after you die.
And I think as that happens , it ' s going to become possible for our digital personas to continue to interact in the real world long after we ' re gone thanks to the vastness of the amount of content we ' re creating and technology ' s ability to make sense of it all.
You can imagine what something like this might look like five , 10 or 20 years from now as our technical capabilities improve.
What if we were able to use that same type of technology to beam a representation of our loved ones into our living rooms -- interacting in a very lifelike way based on all the content they created while they were alive ? 
Economics writer Tim Harford studies complex systems -- and finds a surprising link among the successful ones : they were built through trial and error . In this sparkling talk from TEDGlobal 2011 , he asks us to embrace our randomness and start making better mistakes.
It ' s the Second World War.
The symptoms are this horrible swelling up of fluids under the skin.
And people do terrible things in wars.
He said he heard suspicious laughter.
But Archie Cochrane was a resourceful person.
It looks like crude oil.
So Archie splits the men under his care as best he can into two equal groups.
And after just a few days , it becomes clear that whatever is causing this illness , marmite is the cure.
Cochrane , he starts ranting at these Germans in this Scottish accent -- in fluent German , by the way , but in a Scottish accent -- and explains to them how German culture was the culture that gave Schiller and Goethe to the world.
If we don ' t supply vitamins to the prisoners , it ' s a war crime. " 
I ' m telling you this story because Archie Cochrane , all his life , fought against a terrible affliction , and he realized it was debilitating to individuals and it was corrosive to societies.
So the symptoms of the complex are , no matter how complicated the problem , you have an absolutely overwhelming belief that you are infallibly right in your solution.
I see it in our business leaders.
Imagine for a moment that , instead of Tim Harford in front of you , there was Hans Rosling presenting his graphs.
But a typical Hans Rosling graph : think for a moment , not what it shows , but think instead about what it leaves out.
I mean , have a look at this graph.
Cesar has trolled the database of over 5,000 different products , and he ' s used techniques of network analysis to interrogate this database and to graph relationships between the different products.
Brilliant work.
Five thousand products -- imagine counting every product category in Cesar Hidalgo ' s data.
There are 100,000 there . It would take you all day.
This is how complex the economy we ' ve created is.
And just a piece of context -- the societies in which our brains evolved had about 300 products and services.
We tend to retreat and say ,  " We can draw a picture , we can post some graphs , we get it , we understand how this works. " 
I ' m not trying to say we can ' t solve complicated problems in a complicated world.
Now you show me a successful complex system , and I will show you a system that has evolved through trial and error.
Maybe I should clarify it.
And it ' s not just biological systems that produce miracles through trial and error.
How do you do it ? 
Then the spray dries . It turns into powder.
You make lots of money.
You find yourself a mathematician ; you find yourself a physicist -- somebody who understands the dynamics of this fluid.
But the geneticist Professor Steve Jones describes how Unilever actually did solve this problem -- trial and error , variation and selection.
You try out all 10 . You keep the one that works best.
It looks a bit like a chess piece -- functions absolutely brilliantly.
And we ' ve heard a lot about how economies function.
That is a huge failure rate.
And eventually , they ' ll have evolved to such a high peak of perfection that they will make us all their pets -- if , of course , they haven ' t already done so.
It ' s come through trial and error.
Now why are you just wandering around saying this obvious thing ?  " 
Stop giving them lists of questions every single one of which has an answer.
When a politician stands up campaigning for elected office and says ,  " I want to fix our health system.
We ' re going to test them out . They ' ll probably all fail.
Until then , until then I ' m going to keep banging on about trial and error and why we should abandon the God complex.
There ' s this one trial he ran many years after World War II.
They had the God complex in spades.
And after the trial had been running for a little while , he gathered together all his colleagues around his table , and he said ,  " Well , gentlemen , we have some preliminary results.
It is dangerous for patients to recover from heart attacks at home.
Shut it down at once. " 
It turns out your hospitals are killing people , and they should be at home.
And the reason he would do that kind of thing is because he understood it feels so much better to stand there and say ,  " Here in my own little world , I am a god , I understand everything.
Cochrane understood that uncertainty , that fallibility , that being challenged , they hurt.
It ' s incredibly painful.
In fact , it turns out it ' s equivalent to proving Fermat ' s Last Theorem.
And shortly before his 30th birthday in 1958 , Yutaka Taniyama killed himself.
But he made mistakes in a good direction.
business,cars,culture,economics,parenting,statistics,transportation
And in fact , among all the diseases that existed in this land , it was the worst . It killed the most children.
But the worst thing about it was that you couldn ' t use it on the youngest children , on infants , and on one-year-olds.
And although parents tried as hard as they could to use it properly , almost all of them ended up using it wrong in the end.
They had their two cures . Until a particular mother , whose child had just turned two , died of this disease.
And the people thought ,  " You know , you ' re right.
And the people were happy . They were satisfied.
And he thought about it , and the expensive one didn ' t seem that great to him . So he thought ,  " I don ' t know anything about science , but I do know something about data , so maybe I should go and look at the data and see whether this expensive and complicated treatment actually works any better than the cheap and simple one. " 
And in particular , the people who made this expensive solution were very upset because they thought ,  " How can we hope to compete with something that ' s essentially free ? 
And so , anyway , here I am . It ' s not a fairy tale.
And then , finally talk a little bit about a third way , about another technology , which is probably better than anything we have , but which -- there hasn ' t been any enthusiasm for adoption precisely because people are so enamored with the current car seat solution . OK.
So in every car crash in which at least one person dies , they have information on all of the people.
If they ' re wearing a lap-and-shoulder belt , in this raw data , 19.4 percent die . And interestingly , wearing a lap-only seatbelt , 16.7 percent die . And actually , the theory tells you that the lap-only seatbelt ' s got to be worse than the lap-and-shoulder belt . And that just reminds you that when you deal with raw data , there are hundreds of confounding variables that may be getting in the way.
So , this is the data I just showed , OK ? 
And so , you can see that the lap-only seatbelts start to look worse once you do that.
And it ' s not just overall . It ' s very robust to anything you want to look at.
But when you look at other types of crashes , like rear-impact crashes , indeed , the car seats don ' t perform as well.
But indeed , in recent crashes the lap-and-shoulder seatbelts , actually , are doing even better than the car seats.
But what ' s interesting is the government telling us to use them is not actually based on very much.
And I said ,  " That ' s a great idea. " 
Now , eventually , one did . Under the conditions of anonymity , they said they would be happy to do this test for us -- so anonymity , and 1,500 dollars per seat that we crashed.
Here , they don ' t actually crash the entire car , you know -- it ' s not worth ruining a whole car to do it.
Does he not look content , ready to go , like he could survive anything ?  And then , if you look at the kid in back , it looks like he ' s already choking before the crash even happens.
These are three-year-old dummies , by the way.
This is a car seat that was installed by someone who has installed 1,000 car seats , who knew exactly how to do it.
The federal standards are that you have to score below a 1,000 to be an approved car seat on this crash , in some metric of units which are not important.
Anyway , it turns out that those two crashes , that actually the three-year-old did slightly worse . So , he gets about a 500 out of -- you know , on this range -- relative to a 400 and something.
And this seatbelt would have passed with flying colors into being approved as a car seat.
The six-year-old is in a car seat , and it turns out that looks terrible , but that ' s great . That ' s like a 400 , OK ? 
That ' s some more evidence , so in some sense -- I was criticized by a scientist , who said ,  " You could never publish a study with an n of 4, "  meaning those four crashes.
And so I think the answer to this puzzle is that there ' s a much better solution out there , that ' s gotten nobody excited because everyone is so delighted with the way car seats are presumably working.
I mean , why not start -- who ' s sitting in the back seat anyway except for kids ? 
It seems to me that this can ' t be a very expensive solution , and it ' s got to work better than what we already have.
So , my father would have patients come in who he thought were not really sick.
They were almost impossible to swallow.
And the jar of pills he had , he said , were the tiniest little pills he could find , so small you could barely see them.
So , my dad always took that as evidence that this little , teeny , powerful pill had the ultimate placebo effect . And in some sense , if that ' s the right story , I think integrated car seats you will see , very quickly , becoming something that everyone has . The other possible conclusion is , well , maybe after coming to my father three times , getting sent home with placebos , he still felt sick , he went and found another doctor.
Is there any data to show that child seats are actually less effective , or just as effective as seatbelts for serious injury ?  Because that would prove your case. )  Steven Levitt : Yeah , that ' s a great question . In my data , and in another data set I ' ve looked at for New Jersey crashes , I find very small differences in injury.
And they use a completely different methodology that involves -- after the crash occurs , they get from the insurance companies the names of the people who were in the crash , and they call them on the phone , and they asked them what happened.
Even if they ' re right , it ' s not so clear that they ' re so cost-effective.

I wanted to give you a current picture of the economy.
So what I ' m going to try to do in the next 17 and a half minutes is I ' m going to talk first about the flames -- where we are in the economy -- and then I ' m going to take three trends that have taken place at TED over the last 25 years and that will take place in this conference and I will try and bring them together.
But anyway , let ' s start with the economy.
So , a normal commercial bank has nine to 10 times leverage.
And your friendly Citibank had 47 times.
And as you think about that , you ' ve got to wonder : so what do banks have in store for you now ? 
But the problem with Santa Clause is , if you look at the mandatory spending of what these folks have been doing and promising folks , it turned out that in 1967 , 38 percent was mandatory spending on what we call  " entitlements. " 
And we thought we were going to be able to lay these debts off on our kids , but , guess what ? 
Here ' s some advice from one of the largest investors in the United States.
Here ' s his first bit of advice.
And then all bets are off.
And it ' s 10 triliion dollars.
So the next time somebody as cute as this shows up on your doorstep , and sometimes this creature ' s called Chrysler and sometimes Ford and sometimes .. . whatever you want -- you ' ve just got to say no.
The orange slice is what ' s discretionary.
We ' ve got to start thinking about asking people to retire a little bit later.
If you ' re under 50 we want you to work four more years.
We ' ve got to limit other mandatory spending.
I got what you ' re thinking.
So , Japan had a fiscal real estate crisis back in the late  ' 80s.
And unless you want this person to not just become the CFO of Florida , but the United States , we ' d better deal with this stuff.
That wave is much larger , much more powerful , and that ' s of course the wave of technology.
And that ' s what we ' ve got to keep growing.
That ' s where the ability to engineer microbes , the ability to engineer tissues , and the ability to engineer robots begin to lead to a reboot.
So think of it as a Radio Shack for biology.
They just happened to be alive instead of circuit boards.
Then they grow exponentially.
And when they stopped growing they would smell like bananas.
They started competing.
The team from Taiwan was a little bit more ambitious.
And that was very cool stuff back then.
You can freeze half its heart . It regrows.
And , of course if you can build mice molars in Petri dishes , you can grow human molars in Petri dishes.
You re-grow a set of teeth.
So , a Spanish woman who was dying of T.B . had a donor trachea , they took all the cells off the trachea , they spraypainted her stem cells onto that cartilage.
So there are now nine women walking around Boston with re-grown bladders , which is much more pleasant than walking around with a whole bunch of plastic bags for the rest of your life.
Last year , this group was able to take all the cells off a heart , leaving just the cartilage.
This may be one of the ultimate papers.
Third trend : robots.
Didn ' t happen.
This is Boston Dynamics '   " BigDog. " 
And this stuff is moving very quickly , and by the way , that thing can carry about 350 pounds of weight.
And as you bring these things together , as you bring cells , biological tissue engineering and mechanics together , you begin to get some really odd questions.
He sued to be allowed to run , and he won the suit , but didn ' t qualify by time.
I mean , your grandparents had these great big cones , and then your parents had these odd boxes that would squawk at odd times during dinner , and now we have these little buds that nobody sees.
And about two or three years after they can hear as well as you and I can , they ' ll be able to hear maybe how bats sing , or how whales talk , or how dogs talk , and other types of tonal scales.
Very primitive.
They ' ll do stuff you and I can ' t do.
And Darwin , of course , argued that evolution is a natural state.
And that ' s the reason why , as you look at the hominid fossil record , erectus , and heidelbergensis , and floresiensis , and Neanderthals , and Homo sapiens , all overlap.
And then you created Earth about 4.5 billion years ago , and then you got life about four billion years ago , and then you got hominids about 0.006 billion years ago , and then you got our version of hominids about 0.0015 billion years ago.
That would be a mildly arrogant viewpoint.
And I think this isn ' t 1,000 years out.
http://www.ted.com/talks/kevin_kelly_on_the_next_5_000_days_of_the_web.html
Kevin Kelly on the next 5,000 days of the web
It ' s really amazing that all this stuff is here.
And if I told you it was all coming for free , you would say , this is simply -- you ' re dreaming.
That was the model . That was what everybody was suggesting was going to be coming.
It ' s impossible in theory , but possible in practice.
So , I have a kind of a simple story , and it suggests that what we want to think about is this thing that we ' re making , this thing that has happened in 5,000 days -- that ' s all these computers , all these handhelds , all these cell phones , all these laptops , all these servers -- basically what we ' re getting out of all these connections is we ' re getting one machine.
It has not crashed ; it ' s running uninterrupted.
So , I was trying to basically make measurements.
And there ' s 55 trillion links between all the Web pages of the world.
So it ' s a very big number.
And the total traffic on this is running at seven terabytes per second.
A quadrillion transistors is almost the same as the number of neurons in your brain.
Because in fact , that ' s how your brain works -- in kind of the same way that the Web works.
So , what about that ?  Well , here ' s a couple of things.
And the second thing is , we ' re going to restructure its architecture.
We think they ' re all separate devices , but in fact , every screen in the world is looking into the one machine.
And the cloudbook doesn ' t have any storage.
And in some ways , it ' s sort of back to the kind of old idea of centralized computing.
Right now , phones don ' t go through the Web , but they are beginning to , and they will.
Right now , it ' s not . If you do spreadsheets and things at work , a Word document , they aren ' t on the Web , but they are going to be . They ' re going to be part of this machine.
And so every thing will be part of the Web.
A lot of people think about the new economy as something that was going to be a disembodied , alternative , virtual existence , and that we would have the old economy of atoms.
And while there ' s many differences in some senses , they will share more and more in common with each other.
And the network effects rule , meaning that the more you have , the more you get.
Attention is the currency.
And I ' m saying ,  " Humans are now going to be the extended senses of the machine, "  in a certain sense.
Now , the second thing that I want to talk about was this idea of restructuring , that what the Web is doing is restructuring.
And we saw that , where you have all the computers of the world.
It wasn ' t like a telephone system where you had control of a line : you had to share packets.
And if I want to go in to book a flight , I go into the airline ' s flight page , the website of the airline , and I ' m linking to that page.
We ' re now entering to the third stage , which is what I ' m talking about , and that is where we link the data.
So the difference is , is that rather than linking from page to page , we ' re actually going to link from one idea on a page to another idea , rather than to the other page.
So something will resolve down to the information about a particular person , so every person will have a unique ID.
The Web doesn ' t know that that is actually a town , and that it ' s a specific town that I live in , but that ' s what we ' re going to be talking about.
So I ' ll give you one kind of an example.
So that ' s what you want , is all your friends are identified , and you should just carry these relationships around.
we ' re kind of trying out what we want to call this thing.
Everything we ' ve described , every artifact or place , will be a specific representation , will have a specific character that can be linked to directly.
So , the last thing I want to talk about is this idea that we ' re going to be codependent.
So I am open , and being transparent to that.
Google . I can ' t remember my phone number , I ' ll just ask Google.
We cannot imagine ourselves without the alphabet and writing.
So we are the Web , that ' s what this thing is.
The next 5,000 days , it ' s not just going to be the Web but only better -- it ' s going to be something different.
Secondly , it ' s become much more personalized.
And all these devices will be portals into that.
So we might respond to it more as if this was a whole system , more as if this wasn ' t a large organism that we are going to be interacting with . It ' s a  " One. " 
And again , I don ' t want to talk about consciousness , I want to talk about it just as if it was a little bacteria , or a volvox , which is what that organism is.
It ' s going to be machine-readable.
http://www.ted.com/talks/thom_mayne_on_architecture_as_connection.html
Thom Mayne on architecture as connection
I kind of erased everything in my brain to follow that.
Because I have to say , for my whole career , if there ' s anything that ' s been consistent , it ' s been that you can ' t do it.
I can start any number of places , because this process is also -- I think -- very different from some of the morning sessions , which you had such a kind of very clear , such a lineal idea , like the last one , say , with Howard , that I think the creative process in architecture , the design process , is extremely circuitous . It ' s labyrinthine.
But basically , what we do is , we try to give coherence to the world.
Because , really , all I ' m interested in , always , as an architect , is the way things are produced because that ' s what I do . Right ? 
I have no interest in that whatsoever.
And I ' ve had for 30 years an interest in a series of complexities where a series of forces are brought to bear , and to understand the nature of the final result of that , representing the building itself.
And the notion was that I could make an organization not built on normal coherencies , but built on non-sequiturs , built on randomness.
It ' s the relationship -- it ' s the dynamics between the systems -- which have the power to transform and invent and produce an architecture that is -- that would otherwise not exist.
And what I ' m interested in is not the styling of that , but the relationship of that as it enhances that activity.
And what you ' re looking at are possibilities that have to do with the generation of the city as one applies a methodology that uses notions of these multiple forces , that deals with the enormity of the problem , the complexity of the problem , when we ' re designing cities at larger and larger aggregates.
We won the competition -- what was it , nine months ago ? 
And it would become the second largest park in the boroughs , etc.
And so I can start this discussion in any number of places , and I ' ve chosen three or four to talk about.
This is Jim Dine , and it ' s the absence of presence , etc.
And it made us rethink the whole notion of how we work and how we make things , and it led us to ideas that were closer to fashion design as we flattened out surfaces , and then brought them back together as they could make spatial combinations.
This is the Caltrans building in Los Angeles.
And all of a sudden we ' re kind of moving away , and we ' re separating the skin from the body , and that ' s going to lead to broader performance criteria , which I ' m going to talk about in a minute.
It ' s part of a sign system , which was part of the kind of legacy of Los Angeles -- the two-dimension , three-dimension signing , etc.
And then the skin starts transforming into other materials.
And , again , all of it promoting transparency.
This is a building in San Francisco which is under construction.
It ' s a wrong attitude , actually , because the hybrid is probably more interesting.
It adjusts continually . And we removed the air conditioning.
Well , I could also start here.
And when I saw this , first an image and then visited , it completely changed the way I thought after that point.
And that led us to then completely rethinking how we draw , how we work.
There it is modeled as it was developing into a piece of work.
What I ' m interested in are how these ideas participate in the educational process of young people.
And there ' s an overt -- at least , there ' s an attempt to make a very overt notion of a building that connects to the land in a very different way because I was interested in a very didactic approach to the problem , as one would understand that.
They have 22 satellites zipping around at plus or minus 100 miles , and the site ' s in red.
And then right below that the processing , and the mission lift , and the mission control room , and all the other spaces are underground.
The new capital competition for Berlin , four years ago.
And talk about that intensity in terms of the collisions of the kind of events they make that have to do with putting a series of systems together , and then where part of it is in the ground , part of it is oppositional lifts.
And then , again , in a more , kind of traditional setting , this is a graduate student housing in Toronto , and it ' s very much about the relationship of a building as it makes a connective tissue to the city.
And finally , one of the most interesting projects -- it ' s a courthouse.
And this is where the project started . Because I ' m going , I ' m interested in the phenomenon that ' s taking place in here.
Nature is only a cultural edifice today , right ? 
And it forced us to talk about notions of how we work , and the dynamics of that , and what other sources of the work is.
The courts were made of that . The skin is this series of layers that reflect even rusticated stonework , but which were embedded with fragments of the Constitution , which were part of the little process , all set on a plinth that defined it from the community.

I was 17 and going on a peace walk.
And they tried everything they could to get me out of there.
And I then became a deprogrammer.
What happened was that the family had to get their loved ones some safe place somehow.
And about 20 years went by.
Because something did.
And it had a chilling effect on me.
The top picture is a group of Moonies that have been blessed by their messiah.
The thing I had to admit to myself , with great repulsion , was that I get it.
And how I ' ve come to view what happened to me is a viral , memetic infection.
These easy ideas to complex questions are very appealing when you are emotionally vulnerable.
All I have to do is humbly follow.
And the most dangerous part of this is that is creates  " us "  and  " them, "   " right "  and  " wrong, "   " good "  and  " evil. " 
And so if you looked at my brain , or any brain that ' s infected with a viral memetic infection like this , and compared it to anyone in this room , or anyone who uses critical thinking on a regular basis , I am convinced it would look very , very different.
It happens in the human brain . There is no evil force out there to get us.
Did you know you have functioning neurons in your intestines -- about a hundred million of them ?  Food scientist Heribert Watzke tells us about the  " hidden brain "  in our gut and the surprising things it makes us feel.
This technology made a very important impact on us.
So let ' s make a little test.
Smile . Smile . Open the mouths.
Of course not.
It ' s for cooked food.
I would say , we should call ourselves coctivors -- from coquere , to cook.
It ' s technology.
Because brains are expensive.
It ' s very expensive.
Invisible -- everyone of us does it every day , so to speak.
I think the good news for me would be if we could go back and talk about the unleashing , the continuation of the unleashing of human potential.
If you can cook , nothing can happen to you , because whatever you find , you will try to transform it.
This technology affected two organs , the brain and the gut , which it actually affected.
So because of having cooked food , it ' s easier to digest.
Now the big brain did this also with cooking.
And this is actually taste reward and energy.
You need proteins for muscles , recovery.
Think about bittersweet chocolate ; or think about the acidity of yogurt -- wonderful -- mixed with strawberry fruits.
So satisfaction was a very important part.
I use the euphemism digestive comfort -- actually -- it ' s a digestive discomfort , which the gut is concerned with.
This is what we are using. " 
Now if there ' s a gut brain , we should also learn to talk with this brain.
And between this muscle , they found nervous tissues , a lot of nervous tissues , which penetrate actually the muscle -- penetrate the submucosa , where you have all the elements for the immune system.
Now if you think about the gut , the gut is -- if you could stretch it -- 40 meters long , the length of a tennis court.
It has 20 different neuron types.
It senses it by chemical means and very importantly by mechanical means , because it has to move the food -- it has to mix all the various elements which we need for digestion.
And then finally , it controls also the secretion of this molecular machinery , which actually digests the food we cook.
The lower layer , our gut brain , has its own goals -- digestion defense -- and we have the higher brain with the goal of integration and generating behaviors.
So if we take two types of signals -- a hunger signal for example.
At least in my case , they are not listened to.
The more usual case is overeating.
This we found from bariatric surgery.
Now what would be the language we have to talk to the gut brain that its signals are so strong that the big brain cannot ignore it ? 
You have on your left an olive oil droplet , and this olive oil droplet gets attacked by enzymes.
Actually , what happens is that a very intricate structure appears.
Now if we could take this language -- and this is a language of structures -- and make it longer-lasting , that it can go through the passage of the intestine , it would generate stronger signals.
We have a coctivor ' s opportunity , because we have learned over the last two million years which taste and reward -- quite sophisticated to cook -- to please ourselves , to satisfy ourselves.

Wade Davis : The worldwide web of belief and ritual
And I spent two months in the caves of southwest France with the poet Clayton Eshleman , who wrote a beautiful book called  " Juniper Fuse. " 
He said ,  " You know , clearly at some point , we were all of an animal nature , and at some point , we weren ' t. " 
And the most amazing thing about the Upper Paleolithic art is that as an aesthetic expression , it lasted for almost 20,000 years.
Now , all people share the same raw , adaptive imperatives.
And that is the fact that we are all brothers and sisters.
And so whether that genius is placed into -- technological wizardry has been the great achievement of the West -- or by contrast , into unraveling the complex threads of memory inherent in a myth , is simply a matter of choice and cultural orientation.
But what do I mean by different visions of life making for completely different possibilities for existence ? 
These are men and women who , even today , can name 250 stars in the night sky.
And if we slip from the realm of the sea into the realm of the spirit of the imagination , you enter the realm of Tibetan Buddhism.
What is Buddhism but 2,500 years of empirical observation as to the nature of mind ? 
Our billboards celebrate naked children in underwear.
And en route , we took darshan from Rinpoche , and he sat with us and told us about the Four Noble Truths , the essence of the Buddhist path.
By that , the Buddha did not mean stupidity ; he meant clinging to the illusion that life is static and predictable.
You saw a woman who was more clear than a pool of water in a mountain stream.
And if we move from the realm of the spirit to the realm of the physical , to the sacred geography of Peru -- I ' ve always been interested in the relationships of indigenous people that literally believe that the Earth is alive , responsive to all of their aspirations , all of their needs.
And for one day , he wears the clothing of his sister and he becomes a transvestite , a waylaka . And for that day , he leads all able-bodied men on a run , but it ' s not your ordinary run.
Climb again over the course of 24 hours.
I only managed to do it by chewing more coca leaves in one day than anyone in the 4,000-year history of the plant.
You place the cross into the ice , in the shadow of Ausangate , the most sacred of all Apus , or sacred mountains of the Inca.
On the contrary , it was completely linked in to the 14,000 kilometers of royal roads the Inca made in less than a century.
Climb Huayna Picchu , find another altar.
The sacred river , the Urubamba , or the Vilcanota , which is itself the Earthly equivalent of the Milky Way , but it ' s also the trajectory that Viracocha walked at the dawn of time when he brought the universe into being.
Now , when I was here at the first TED , I showed this photograph : two men of the Elder Brothers , the descendants , survivors of El Dorado.
All that time , the world only exists as an abstraction , as they are taught the values of their society.
So , literally two weeks ago , I returned from having spent six weeks with the Elder Brothers on what was clearly the most extraordinary trip of my life.
Their central metaphor is a loom.
You can see the calcium buildup on the head of the poporo gourd.
Fields are planted in such an extraordinary way , that the one side of the field is planted like that by the women.
I traveled with the Arhuacos , and the wonderful thing about this story was that this man , Danilo Villafane -- if we just jump back here for a second.
And because of that , Danilo invited us to go to the very heart of the world , a place where no journalist had ever been permitted.
No , it ' s not true that they ' re kept in the darkness for 18 years , but they are kept within the confines of the ceremonial men ' s circle for 18 years.
And it was extraordinary to be taken by a priest.
And then of course , as we reached our final destination , a place called Mamancana , we were in for a surprise , because the FARC were waiting to kidnap us.
And we ran into a FARC patrol at dawn , so it was quite harrowing.
And here you see how their sacred landscape has been covered by brothels and hotels and casinos , and yet , still they pray.
Now , if we slip to another end of the world , I was up in the high Arctic to tell a story about global warming , inspired in part by the former Vice President ' s wonderful book.
And yet tragically , when you now go to those northern communities , you find to your astonishment that whereas the sea ice used to come in in September and stay till July , in a place like Kanak in northern Greenland , it literally comes in now in November and stays until March.
On the contrary , you know , if you have the heart to feel and the eyes to see , you discover that the world is not flat.
They ' re unique facets of the human imagination.
Our industrial society is scarcely 300 years old.
And there is indeed a fire burning over the Earth , taking with it not only plants and animals , but the legacy of humanity ' s brilliance.
These peoples are not failed attempts at being modern -- quaint and colorful and destined to fade away as if by natural law.
Product designer Eben Bayer reveals his recipe for a new , fungus-based packaging material that protects fragile stuff like furniture , plasma screens -- and the environment.
So , I ' d like to spend a few minutes with you folks today imagining what our planet might look like in a thousand years.
We ' re using mushrooms to create an entirely new class of materials , which perform a lot like plastics during their use , but are made from crop waste and are totally compostable at the end of their lives.
Yet , after just a few weeks of use , you ' ll throw this material in the trash.
The EPA estimates , in the United States , by volume , this material occupies 25 percent of our landfills.
They ' re not biologically compatible.
So , for all these reasons , I think we need better materials , and there are three key principles we can use to guide these materials.
Second of all , we should really strive to use far less energy in creating these materials.
This recycling system has been in place for the last billion years.
But nature provides us with a really good model here.
Because in nature , mushrooms are the recycling system.
In our process , we basically use it as a glue.
So I ' d like to share with you the four basic steps required to make these materials.
The final step is , of course , the product , whether it ' s a packaging material , a table top , or building block.
If you ' re in Northern Europe or North America , you can use things like buckwheat husks or oat hulls.
It ' s a waste product.
Because the manufacturing process is our organism.
And it ' s kind of hard to picture how that happens.
And what parts of the seed husk we don ' t digest , actually become part of the final , physical composite.
The last step , of course , is application.
Best of all , when it gets to the customer , it ' s not trash.
You want to be able to do this anywhere in the world and not worry about peak rice hull or peak cottonseed hulls , because you have multiple choices.
Biological yield is really important.
And while , today , we can practically guarantee that yesterday ' s packaging is going to be here in 10,000 years , what I want to guarantee is that in 10,000 years , our descendants , our children ' s children , will be living happily and in harmony with a healthy Earth.
culture,genetics,science,statistics,technology
But unlike the other speakers , I ' m not going to tell you about the mysteries of the universe , or the wonders of evolution , or the really clever , innovative ways people are attacking the major inequalities in our world.
One of my senior colleagues told me , when I was a youngster in this profession , rather proudly , that statisticians were people who liked figures but didn ' t have the personality skills to become accountants.
This evening , there ' s a reception in the University ' s Museum of Natural History.
When they say to you ,  " What do you do ?  "  -- you say ,  " I ' m a statistician. " 
Or they ' ll suddenly become parched and/or hungry -- and often both -- and sprint off for a drink and some food.
And it ' s something I ' ve never really found a good way of doing.
She told this to one of her colleagues , who said ,  " Well , what does your boyfriend do ?  " 
So when her colleague said ,  " What does he do ?  " 
 " He models genes. " 
You ' ve got to think , and I ' m going to ask you some questions.
Here ' s one -- a head , followed by a tail , followed by a tail.
So you might think there are more interesting things to do , but humor me for the moment.
The next time , after the 15th toss.
So , on this side , you get out your coins , and you toss and toss and toss.
So here ' s a deep mathematical fact -- if you ' ve got two numbers , one of three things must be true.
And I don ' t want to end up in the two-minute silence to give you more time to think about it , until everyone ' s expressed a view . OK.
Who thinks that C is true -- that , on average , it ' ll take less time to see head-tail-head than head-tail-tail ? 
It ' s not . A is true here.
Anything different about the two patterns ? 
That turns out to be important.
On this side -- remember , you ' re excited about head-tail-tail ; you ' re excited about head-tail-head.
You ' re waiting with bated breath for the final toss.
And you keep tossing , to wait for the next head , to get excited.
Then you toss the coin.
Another way of thinking about it -- if we tossed a coin eight million times , then we ' d expect a million head-tail-heads and a million head-tail-tails -- but the head-tail-heads could occur in clumps.
It ' s a very , very simple example , an easily stated question in probability , which every -- you ' re in good company -- everybody gets wrong.
When you look at DNA , there ' s a sequence of not two things -- heads and tails -- but four letters -- As , Gs , Cs and Ts.
How long will those chunks be ?  " 
But it turns out that unlocking the secrets in the information generated by modern experimental technologies , a key part of that has to do with fairly sophisticated -- you ' ll be relieved to know that I do something useful in my day job , rather more sophisticated than the head-tail-head story -- but quite sophisticated computer modelings and mathematical modelings and modern statistical techniques.
The natural thing to do after you ' ve done that -- and that ' s what this project , the International HapMap Project , which is a collaboration between labs in five or six different countries.
The most pressing one is that we want to understand how some differences make some people susceptible to one disease -- type-2 diabetes , for example -- and other differences make people more susceptible to heart disease , or stroke , or autism and so on.
Why do we want to do that ? 
So that ' s , as I said , the little diversion on my main love.
And I take one of you , or I take someone off the street , and I test them for the disease in question.
So a natural answer is 99 percent.
Well , you ' re right to be a bit skeptical , because that ' s not the answer.
So let me try and illustrate that.
And in fact , if this is the prevalence of the disease , about 100 will have the disease and the rest won ' t.
Amongst all these other people who don ' t have the disease , the test will get it right 99 percent of the time.
So even though we think the test is accurate , the important part of the story is there ' s another bit of information we need.
One explanation is that the person doesn ' t have the disease -- that ' s overwhelmingly likely , if you pick someone at random -- but the test gets it wrong , which is unlikely.
Here ' s a more topical example of exactly the same thing.
And at the trial , her trial , a very distinguished pediatrician gave evidence that the chance of two cot deaths , innocent deaths , in a family like hers -- which was professional and non-smoking -- was one in 73 million.
To be put through the stress of the trial , convicted of murdering them -- and to spend time in a women ' s prison , where all the other prisoners think you killed your children -- is a really awful thing to happen to someone.
So he said ,  " I ' ll assume that if you have one cot death in a family , the chance of a second child dying from cot death aren ' t changed. " 
So he said ,  " Here , I ' ll assume that these events are independent.
And secondly , it ' s palpably false.
They ' ve probably got these environmental risk factors and/or genetic risk factors we don ' t know about.
That ' s the first problem.
It ' s exactly the same logical error as the logical error of thinking that after the disease test , which is 99 percent accurate , the chance of having the disease is 99 percent.
There are two things involved -- two parts to the explanation.
Not as unlikely as one in 73 million , but nonetheless rather unlikely.
And then if she were trying to kill the children , she succeeded.
We know the children died.
In fact , there are two other women who were convicted on the basis of the evidence of this pediatrician , who have subsequently been released on appeal.
Well , we know that randomness and uncertainty and chance are very much a part of our everyday life.
We can cope with the subtleties of language brilliantly -- and there are interesting evolutionary questions about how we got here.
All of quality control , which has had a major impact on industrial processing , is underpinned by statistics.
So if a pediatrician had come out and said to a jury ,  " I know how to build bridges . I ' ve built one down the road.
And everyone said ,  " Well , that ' s fine . He ' s an expert. " 
Forensic scientists said ,  " The chance that this guy ' s innocent is one in three million. " 
It ' s all very well to say ,  " Let ' s do our best to present the evidence. " 
In the case of uncertainty , we get it wrong all the time -- and at the very least , we should be aware of that , and ideally , we might try and do something about it.

The smoke alarm has saved perhaps hundreds of thousands of lives , worldwide.
What if we could prevent electrical fires before they start ? 
Our invention had to address all of these issues.
Hmmm ...
So here is what we did . We put a 10-cent digital transponder , a data tag , in the appliance plug.
If too much current is flowing , the intelligent receptacle turns itself off , and prevents another fire from starting.
Now , besides saving lives , perhaps the greatest benefit of intelligent power is in its energy savings.
There are 10 billion electrical outlets in North America alone.
And I ' m pleased to announce that just three weeks ago we received our first international recognition , the 2009 CES Innovation Award.
Thank you.

Really when we think of our senses , or when we think of the loss of the sense , we really think about something more like this : the ability to touch something luxurious , to taste something delicious , to smell something fragrant , to see something beautiful.
And that ' s what I ' d like to talk to you a little bit about today.
So many of you know that that ' s Beethoven ' s Seventh Symphony.
It ' s acoustic vibrations in the air , little waves of energy in the air that tickle our eardrum.
Turns out that if you have hearing loss , most people that lose their hearing lose it at what ' s called the cochlea , the inner ear.
And as a physician and a surgeon , I can confidently tell my patients that if you had to pick a sense to lose , we are the furthest along medically and surgically with hearing.
Her mother ' s doing everything she can.
Owl . Owl.
Charles Limb : Now despite everything going for this child in terms of family support and simple infused learning , there is a limitation to what a child who ' s deaf , an infant who was born deaf , has in this world in terms of social , educational , vocational opportunities.
I mean literally , they used to do things like stick ear-shaped objects onto your ears and stick funnels in.
And now today we have the modern multi-channel cochlear implant , which is an outpatient procedure.
Now actually , this is quite crude in comparison to our regular inner ear.
If we could play this video please.
JN : Well this book has seven chapters , and the last chapter is entitled  " The Good Things About Being Deaf. " 
Girl : Well sometimes my sister can be kind of annoying.
Mother : Her sister . Girl : My sister.
JN : So you don ' t want to hear everything that ' s out there ? 
It is . It ' s a huge success story in modern medicine.
Now there are a lot of reasons for that.
When you say a word , what you care is that word was perceived correctly.
There ' s really very little point in listening to music when it doesn ' t sound good to you.
Because I always view music as the pinnacle of hearing.
And without the ability to perceive pitch well , music and melody is a very difficult thing to do -- forget about a harmony and things like that.
We would be thrilled if we had one semitone pitch perception in cochlear implant users.
And it might be that you kind of like that.
Now the other issue comes with , not just the ability to tell pitches apart , but the ability to tell sounds apart.
And the second one.
The sound quality , or the sound of the sound is how I like to describe timbre , tone color -- they cannot tell these things whatsoever.
But actually if you look at melody , what you find is that there ' s very little cortical activity in implant users compared with normal hearing controls.
I ' m going to play you two clips of Usher , one which is normal and one which has almost no high frequencies , almost no low frequencies and not even that many mid frequencies.
Again , we are very , very far away in just getting to where we want to get to.
This is .. . does somebody know ? 
And it turns out that his temporal bones were harvested when he died to try to look at the cause of his deafness , which is why he has molding clay and his skull is bulging out on the side there.
I ' ve been very lucky to work with Dr . David Ryugo where I ' ve been working on deaf cats that are white and trying to figure out what happens when we give them cochlear implants.
But she jumps to action when called to duty!
Now I want to show you one last video.
Joseph : I was born in 1986.
So as a result , I had to rely on lip reading a lot , and I couldn ' t really hear what people were saying.
Since then , I ' ve never looked back.
And this is really unheard of stuff , and this is all because of this technology.
I know he doesn ' t hear well , because I ' ve heard him do Karaoke.
When it comes to restoration of hearing , we have certainly come a long way , a remarkably long way.
You wouldn ' t want decent hearing , you would want perfect hearing.
And I don ' t think that we should give up on beauty.
DNA,MacArthur grant,complexity,computers,short talk
And so this idea has a lot of traction with us.
Raise your right hand . OK . How many of you don ' t know what I ' m talking about ?  Raise your left hand.
This is a computer program made of zeros and ones.
It can be compiled into this -- into zeros and ones -- and pronounced by a computer.
It collapses into a three-dimensional shape that turns it into a nanomachine that actually cuts DNA.
It ' s easier to handle . It ' s something that we understand really well.
And this program takes a shape , spits out 250 DNA sequences.
I mix them together , add a little bit of salt water , and then add this long strand I was telling you about , that I ' ve stolen from a virus . And then what happens is , you heat this whole thing up to about boiling . You cool it down to room temperature , and as you do , what happens is those short strands , they do the following thing : each one of them binds that long strand in one place , and then has a second half that binds that long strand in a distant place , and brings those two parts of the long strand close together so that they stick together.
You can look with a microscope and see them on a surface.
If you change the spell again , you change the sequence again.
We want to be able to build technological artifacts that are maybe good for the world . We want to learn how to build biological artifacts , like people and whales and trees.
global issues,military,peace,war
When I look around this TEDxAmsterdam venue , I see a very special audience.
Some chose the microscope as their instrument.
Ladies and gentlemen , I made a different choice.
I chose this instrument.
A real gun at a few feet ' s distance.
It means The Netherlands is a peaceful country.
In many countries it is a different story.
Weapons can do a lot of harm.
Today I want to tell you why.
My father was a hardworking baker , but when he had finished work in the bakery , he often told me and my brother stories.
Their grim plans were evident.
It was our last resort.
At this decisive moment in Dutch history my father was positioned on the bank of the river Waal near the city of Nijmegen.
No German soldier fell to the ground.
He could have done something.
They liberated my birth town.
I do not like guns.
Now this may sound contradictory to you.
The murder rate in Europe has dropped by a factor of 30 since the Middle Ages.
Has the human mind changed ? 
In his latest book , Harvard professor Steven Pinker -- and many other thinkers before him -- concludes that one of the main drivers behind less violent societies is the spread of the constitutional state and the introduction on a large scale of the state monopoly on the legitimized use of violence -- legitimized by a democratically elected government , legitimized by checks and balances and an independent judicial system.
Secondly , the presence of penalties that outweigh the benefits of using violence tips the balance even further.
Where there is no conflict , trade flourishes.
War is simply no longer the best option , and that is why violence has decreased.
It is this legitimate , controlled use of the gun that has contributed greatly to the statistics of war , conflict and violence around the globe.
Failed states have no legitimized , democratically controlled use of force.
That is why we are trying to build a judicial system right now in Afghanistan.
Every day I hope that politicians , diplomats , development workers can turn conflict into peace and threat into hope.
I stand for my men and women who are prepared to risk their lives for a less violent world for all of us.
It takes good equipment and well-trained , dedicated soldiers.
I hope you will respect my soldiers , this soldier with this gun.
Inventor , entrepreneur and visionary Ray Kurzweil explains in abundant , grounded detail why , by the 2020s , we will have reverse-engineered the human brain and nanobots will be operating your consciousness.
Well , it ' s great to be here.
We can ' t do that today because solar panels are heavy , expensive and very inefficient.
Bono spoke very eloquently , that we have the tools , for the first time , to address age-old problems of disease and poverty.
I did enjoy Bono ' s comment linking Haight-Ashbury to Silicon Valley.
That ' s been a strong interest of mine , and a theme that I ' ve developed for some 30 years.
So I began to be an ardent student of technology trends , and track where technology would be at different points in time , and began to build the mathematical models of that.
And if you ask me , will the price of Google be higher or lower than it is today three years from now , that ' s very hard to say.
And I ' m going to show you a small sample of this , but there ' s really a theoretical reason why technology develops in an exponential fashion.
We had our best Ph.D . students , our most advanced equipment around the world , we got 1/10,000th of the project done , so how ' re we going to get this done in 15 years ? 
It took us 15 years to sequence HIV -- we sequenced SARS in 31 days.
These are all logarithmic graphs , so as you go up the levels it represents , generally multiplying by factor of 10 or 100.
Recent technologies -- like the PC , the web , cell phones -- were under a decade.
So the Cambrian Explosion , when all the body plans of the animals were evolved , took only 10 million years . It was 200 times faster.
But anyway , the evolution of our species took hundreds of thousands of years , and then working through interaction , evolution used , essentially , the technology-creating species to bring on the next stage , which were the first steps in technological evolution.
And we ' ve had a continual acceleration of this process.
But you see a very clear trend.
A personal experience , when I was at MIT -- computer taking up about the size of this room , less powerful than the computer in your cell phone.
And that ' s exponential growth through five different paradigms.
That hit a wall . They couldn ' t shrink them and keep the vacuum.
But by the teen years , the features of transistors will be a few atoms in width , and we won ' t be able to shrink them any more.
We ' ll have those ready well before Moore ' s Law runs out of steam.
It ' s pretty remarkable how smooth an exponential process that is.
It ' s the same thing here . We can ' t predict any particular project , but the result of this whole worldwide , chaotic , unpredictable activity of competition and the evolutionary process of technology is very predictable.
They ' re faster , so you ' ve got exponential growth in the speed of transistors , so the cost of a cycle of one transistor has been coming down with a halving rate of 1.1 years.
In terms of price performance , that ' s a 40 to 50 percent deflation rate.
If you have 50 percent deflation , people may increase their volume 30 , 40 percent , but they won ' t keep up with it. " 
As the price performance makes new applications feasible , new applications come to the market.
We ' re understanding the software programs that make our body run.
We ' d like to actually turn that program off.
We were evolved in an era where it wasn ' t in the interests of people at the age of most people at this conference , like myself , to live much longer , because we were using up the precious resources which were better deployed towards the children and those caring for them.
There ' s actually a -- for the first time now , something going to human trials , that actually cures pulmonary hypertension -- a fatal disease -- using gene therapy.
It ' s now under a 10th of a cent.
The Internet has been doubling in power and continues to , measured many different ways.
One has one that actually walks with a surprisingly human-like gait , that ' s built out of molecules.
These things have already been done in animals.
Once we understand its principles of operation , and the pace with which we are reverse-engineering biology is accelerating , we can actually design these things to be thousands of times more capable.
Presumably we ' ll ban them , but then we ' ll have the specter of teenagers in their high schools gyms routinely out-performing the Olympic athletes.
There ' s actually one going into human trial , so this is feasible technology.
Well , it turns out we can see inside the human brain , and in fact not surprisingly , the spatial and temporal resolution of brain scanning is doubling every year.
This is a block diagram of a model and simulation of the human auditory cortex that actually works quite well -- in applying psychoacoustic tests , gets very similar results to human auditory perception.
All of this is driving exponentially growing economic progress.
That was strictly a capital-markets phenomena.
It would be able to translate from one language to another.
Images will be written directly to our retina , providing full-immersion virtual reality , augmented real reality . We ' ll be interacting with virtual personalities.
We ' ll have completed the reverse-engineering of the human brain , 1,000 dollars of computing will be far more powerful than the human brain in terms of basic raw capacity.
We are going to merge with our technology.
So , for example , full-immersion virtual reality from within the nervous system , the nano-bots shut down the signals coming from your real senses , replace them with the signals that your brain would be receiving if you were in the virtual environment , and then it ' ll feel like you ' re in that virtual environment.
But most importantly , it ' ll be a tremendous expansion of human intelligence through this direct merger with our technology , which in some sense we ' re doing already.
Many -- even scientists -- assume a linear model , so they ' ll say ,  " Oh , it ' ll be hundreds of years before we have self-replicating nano-technology assembly or artificial intelligence. " 
These are very powerful technologies.
In this talk from TED University 2009 , veteran rock climber Matthew Childs shares nine pointers for rock climbing . These handy tips bear on an effective life at sea level , too.
It ' s pretty simple . There are nine , sort of , rules that I discovered after 35 years of rock climbing.
So hang in there , and you come up with some pretty peculiar solutions.
You ' re climbing on little dimples and nubbins in the rock.
Rule number three : have a plan.
There is about 1,000 feet of air below him.
You get to the last pitch . It ' s easy.
This is a climb called the Dike Route , on Pywjack Dome , up in the Yosemite high country.
You don ' t want to stop in the middle like Coleridge ' s Kubla Kahn.
This is a climb in the Needles , again in California.
This is the Devils Tower in Wyoming , which is a columnar basalt formation that most of you probably know from  " Close Encounters. " 
In the 35 years I ' ve been a climbing guide and taught on indoor walls , and stuff like that , the most important thing I ' ve learned was , guys will always try to do pull-ups.
So balance is really critical , and keeping your weight on your feet , which is your strongest muscle.
So don ' t hang on till the bitter end.

Another update : You will recall I introduced you guys to the Quadro Tracker.
Like if you ' re looking for marijuana in students '  lockers , it ' ll point right to somebody.
this device , the ADE 651 , was sold to the Iraqi government for 40,000 dollars apiece.
So what I want to talk about today is belief.
We believe all sorts of things.
So like Fox Mulder on  " X-Files, "  who wants to believe in UFOs ?  Well , we all do , and the reason for that is because we have a belief engine in our brains.
We find patterns , we make those connections , whether it ' s Pavlov ' s dog here associating the sound of the bell with the food , and then he salivates to the sound of the bell , or whether it ' s a Skinnerian rat , in which he ' s having an association between his behavior and a reward for it , and therefore he repeats the behavior.
And that ' s called superstition , and that , I ' m afraid , we will always have with us.
Our second type of error is a false negative.
Your name is Lucy , okay ? 
Well , if you think that the rustle in the grass is a dangerous predator and it turns out it ' s just the wind , you ' ve made an error in cognition , made a Type I error , false positive.
You ' ve just won a Darwin award.
We have a pattern detection problem that is assessing the difference between a Type I and a Type II error is highly problematic , especially in split-second , life-and-death situations.
So for example , what do you see here ? 
And is it really a horse ? 
Yes , of course , it ' s a cow.
Yes , there it is . And there ' s the prime.
How about here ? 
This is an experiment done by Jennifer Whitson at U.T . Austin on corporate environments and whether feelings of uncertainty and out of control makes people see illusory patterns.
For example , baseball players are notoriously superstitious when they ' re batting , but not so much when they ' re fielding.
What do you see in this particular one here , in this field ? 
And those who scored high on the ESP scale , tended to not only see more patterns in the degraded images but incorrect patterns.
So if you present subjects the images such that it ' s going to end up on the right hemisphere instead of the left , then they ' re more likely to see patterns than if you put it on the left hemisphere.
L-DOPA ' s a drug , as you know , given for treating Parkinson ' s disease , which is related to a decrease in dopamine.
In fact , neuroleptic drugs that are used to eliminate psychotic behavior , things like paranoia , delusions and hallucinations , these are patternicities.
On the other hand , amphetamines like cocaine are dopamine agonists.
So perhaps more dopamine is related to more creativity.
You miss the real patterns . You don ' t want to be too skeptical.
Every time somebody looks at you , you think people are staring at you.
One sees maybe just the right number of patterns to win a Nobel Prize.
And of course you all know exactly what this is , right ? 
These are sandals.
It turns out what you ' re thinking about a lot influences what you tend to see.
So what you see in this particular ambiguous figure is , of course , the dolphins , right ? 
If you look down here , it ' s fine . If you look up here , then you get conflicting data.
So you say ,  " Aw , come on Shermer , anybody can do that in a Psych 101 text with an illusion like that. " 
But even when I take it away , the illusion is so powerful because of how are brains are wired to find those certain kinds of patterns.
And so your brain is fooled.
I ' m actually not even sure if this is -- this might be Photoshopped.
The one on the left . Okay . So I ' ll rotate it so it ' ll be the one on the right.
Well , why is this happening ? 
And then you notice something quite a little bit odd about the eyes and the mouth.
What ' s the difference between those ? 
This is an idea that we got from a fellow TEDster here , Dan Dennett , who talked about taking the intentional stance.
The intelligent designer ' s always portrayed as this super intelligent , moral being that comes down to design life.
But this is a pattern detection problem , isn ' t it ? 
My favorite one was he was in the manhole.
Because , let ' s face it , some patterns are real.
We did a whole issue on it.
Well , that ' s a whole other lecture.
Our agenticity process comes from the fact that we can enjoy movies like these.
You get a hypoxia , or a lower oxygen.
So I ' m going to end here with a short video clip that sort of brings all this together.
Narrator : This is the venue they chose for their fake auditions for an advert for lip balm.
And we have our own lip balm , and we have a leading brand.
Girl : That would be fine.
Pull it so you can ' t even see down.
Girl : Okay.
Pucker up big and lean in just a little bit , okay ? 
Girl : Oh my God!

The second school I was at had big trees too , had a fantastic tulip tree , I think it was the biggest in the country , and it also had a lot of wonderful bushes and vegetation around it , around the playing fields.
And it was an amazing learning experience because , for me , human rights have been something in which I had , you know , a part-time interest , but , mainly , it was something that happened to other people over there.
And , once again , I got an extraordinary education , and it was the first time , really , that I ' d met a lot of these people in the different countries , and these human rights stories became very physical , and , again , I couldn ' t really walk away quite so comfortably.
It didn ' t really get anywhere , and then the Rodney King incident happened , and people thought , OK , if you have a camera in the right place at the right time , or , perhaps , the wrong time , depending who you are , then you can actually start doing something , and campaigning , and being heard , and telling people about what ' s going on.
And 20,000 kids have been taken away to become child soldiers , and the International Criminal Court is going after five of the leaders of the -- now , what ' s it called ? 
still exists back home.
Jennifer : A soldier walked onto the road , asking where we ' d been.
Jennifer : The man came and started undressing me.
Man : The soldiers with clubs this long beat us to get a confession.
I fell . They ran to join the others .. . leaving me for dead.
In my country , it was -- we had been looking at pictures of British soldiers beating up young Iraqis ; we ' ve got Abu Ghraib ; we ' ve got Guantanamo Bay.
And as the story of Mr . Morales , just down the road , excuse me , Mr . Gabriel , would you mind if we delayed your execution a little bit ? 
Text : You can say a story is fabricated.
But you can ' t say what you just saw never happened.
All the video you have just seen was recorded by human rights groups working with WITNESS.
There could be a new movement growing up , rising from the ground , reaching for the light , and growing strong , just like a tree . Thank you.

And by the use of pitching PowerPoints to VCs , I have personally raised tens of millions of dollars from VCs through PowerPoint pitches.
And there are obviously all kinds of things.
And so therefore , the entire purpose of a VC pitch is to convince them that you are the entrepreneur in whom they are going to invest their money and make a lot of money in return.
People ' s attention span after 18 minutes begins to drop off , tests have shown.
DSR : Boy , oh boy , oh boy! And that ' s a straight line we got right over there . And I didn ' t even prompt him.
And what ' s the second most important thing after integrity ? 
You ' ve got to convey passion.
Then there are a whole panoply of other things that you ' ve got to do , to wrap up in this package that you ' re presenting to a VC.
So that ' s why VCs love to fund serial entrepreneurs.
But they want experience in creating an organization.
So I don ' t want somebody who ' s saying ,  " Hey , I ' ve got a great idea in a business I know nothing about.
You ' ve got to know your area.
There are very few people who have the full set of skills that it takes to run a company.
And you have the charisma and the management style and the ability to get people to follow your lead , to inspire them , to motivate them to be part of your team.
I want you to say , or I want you to convey , that you are going to die if you have to , with your very last breath , with your fingernails scratching as they drag you out.
There ' s never been an angel- or a venture-funded company where bad things didn ' t happen.
I don ' t want another  " me too "  product.
And before you get to change the world , bad things are going to take place.
You need to be coachable.
Okay , so how do you convey all these 10 things in 10 minutes without saying any more ? 
It starts off , you walk in the door.
And it goes from beginning to end.
I have invested tens of millions of dollars. " 
And then from there , you ' ve got to take them on a very solid , steady , upward path , right from beginning to end.
You want to be able to get them to such an emotional high that they are ready to write you a check , throw money at you , right there before you leave.
You stop , you ' ve got to figure it out.
And then you ' ve got to tell me how you ' re going to do it , and what it is you ' re going to do . How you ' re going to do it.
So , for example , if you reference companies I ' ve heard of , or basic items in your business , I want to know about them . Things that I can relate to : validators , or anything that tells me somebody else has approved this , or there ' s outside validation.
And that ' s two parts.
So it ' s got to be both sides.
Odds are I probably know somebody who has made a widget.
And it ' s a very tricky path to do it.
Well , one may have been gross sales , one may have been net sales , but I want to know that all the numbers make sense together.
All right , so the best way to do this stuff is to look at our betters , look at people who have done this before.
Is this the way you should do a PowerPoint presentation ? 
Yes ?  OK , Steve Jobs.
You ' re focusing on him! This is Steve Jobs.
What ' s good ?  Short , short bullet points.
And you know what ? 
Best of all , images . Just a simple image.
And you ' re focused on me and why I ' m such a great guy , and why you want to invest in me.
Well , first of all , start out . None of these big , long-titled slides with blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah and I ' m presenting to so-and-so , such-and-such a date.
I look at the logo , and it sort of ties it to my brain.
This is not a five-minute pitch . This is , you know , two sentences.
That lets me know the context.
It ' s helpful that you ' ve had experience and you ' ve done this kind of thing before.
Now , this is not a product pitch , not a sales pitch.
You know , don ' t do a live demo.
For every X you sell , you get Y , you do your services of Z.
Whether you have a distribution relationship with somebody , you know , you have a producing partner . Or , you know , again , validation.
Even if the competition is the old way of doing something.
And then all this ties into the financial overview.
Five is a bit much . Probably four is rational.
I want to know what the driver is.
And I want to know how the money you ' re going to get from me is going to help you get there.
You ' re looking for 5 million -- at what kind of valuation ? 
Because I ' m following on.
And then finally , having done all that , you ' ve now told me the whole thing , so now you ' ve got to bring it back to that conclusion.
And I ' m thinking ,  " This is really , really great. " 
Now I come back to you . Nothing else to look at , right ? 
You ' ve noticed here that I ' m not looking at the screen , right ? 
Well , I ' ve got a laptop in front of me , but you ' re looking at me . And you ' re looking at this.
PowerPoint has this built into every copy of PowerPoint that ' s shipped.
So , here ' s my wrap up to take you to the moon , right ? 
It helps you pace yourself , it gives you a timer so we end on time and the whole bit.
Because I ' m using remote control over here.
But it ' s not really good as a handout.
It doesn ' t work , right ?  Don ' t read your speech.
And that is how to pitch to a VC.

By revolution , I mean a drastic and far-reaching change in the way we think and behave -- the way we think and the way we behave.
You know , I ' m sick and tired of us not living up to our potential.
There we are right at the end , right at the bottom , last place as a culture that doesn ' t value innovation.
We ' re the saddest place on Earth , relative to GDP per capita -- the saddest place on Earth.
Business : The lowest perception in the E.U.
And this is despite the fact that everybody knows that small business is the engine of economies.
Last.
This isn ' t story tale ; it ' s not make-believe.
The way we think , the way we behave , our operating system of behaving is broken.
I think we ' re last because -- and this is going to be drastic to some of you -- because we are handicapping ourselves.
Babies play , kids play , adults play.
Let ' s go back to the same three areas.
Because it ' s shown the way we apply , generate and use knowledge is affected by our social and institutional context , which told us what in communism ? 
Be serious.
We have a serious meme running through.
And here ' s how it works.
I want to go back to work because I need to further my career or I just want to go have coffees.
She passes that virus on to baby , and it takes a really , really , really long time -- as the redwood trees -- for that serious meme to get out of our operating system.
True story : I went looking for a school for my kid.
And we said ,  " He ' s five. " 
We need adaptability , the ability to learn how to be creative and innovative.
What are qualities of a Bulgarian work ? 
Controlling -- you ' re obviously an idiot , so I ' m going to make a zillion little processes for you to follow so you don ' t step out of the box.
In social , in education and in our business , don ' t value play.
Just play , that ' s a stupid thing. " 
Play : our brains are hardwired for play.
Nature isn ' t stupid , and it selected for play.
Rats play , but what you might not have known is that rats that play more have bigger brains and they learn tasks better , skills.
Bears play.
And a final really interesting study -- it ' s been shown , a correlation between play and brain size.
Yours truly : humans.
Really cool term : neoteny -- the retention of play and juvenile traits in adults.
We play musical instruments.
It is a huge benefit.
As a result , what happens ? 
It ' s not fiction , it ' s not story tales , it ' s not make-believe ; it ' s cold , hard science.
We hold ourselves back.
It ' s pretty bleak.
Or maybe the workplace of your friends -- here we ' re forward thinking.
 " Oh , my colleagues see me laughing . I must not have enough work, "  or ,  " Oh , I ' ve got to hide because my boss might see me.
The opposite of play is depression . It ' s depression.
It increases our openness to change.
You know , the professional athlete that loves skiing , he ' s serious about it , but he loves it.
We shouldn ' t be feeling guilty.
If you treat your people like people , if you treat them great , they ' re happier , they ' re fulfilled , they have a sense of mastery and purpose.
They buy more of your service and they tell more of their friends , which leads to more profit.
No way . We ' re different. " 
Two , I ' ve tried it . I ' ve tried at Sciant.
We had marginal profit -- I did.
I care that your customer and your team is happy and you ' re organized with that.
And you can say ,  " Well how do you know they ' re happy ?  " 
There ' s nothing holding us back , except our own mentality about play.
Second of all , if you don ' t have the feeling of play in you , you need to rediscover play.
You ' re the ones that have to go back to the office or talk to your friends and ignite the fire of change in the play revolution.
I ' m going to let you make decisions . I ' m going to empower you , and I ' m going to delegate to the lowest level , rather than the top.
We ' re not always right as leaders.
You know what , let them use their mobile phone for personal calls -- heaven forbid.
Lunch is like the recess for work.
Is that all there was ?  " 
What we need is a players '  uprising.
But what you need to do is fan the flames of the revolution.
Nine days before TED2008 , filmmaker David Hoffman lost almost everything he owned in a fire that destroyed his home , office and 30 years of passionate collecting . He looks back at a life that ' s been wiped clean in an instant -- and looks forward.
I had a fire nine days ago.
I just looked at it , and I didn ' t know what to do.
And I was taught some strange thing as a kid , like , you ' ve got to make something good out of something bad.
That ' s my feature film .  " King , Murray "  won Cannes Film Festival 1970 -- the only print I had.
 " You ' ve got to make something good out of something bad, "  I started to say to my friends , neighbors , my sister.
I called my sister . I called my neighbors . I said ,  " Come dig. " 
That ' s my daughter , Jean.
I came up with this idea : a life of bits and pieces , which I ' m just starting to work on -- my next project.
It ' s the only copy I had . Pieces of it.
I just instead said ,  " I ' m going to make something out of it , and maybe next year .. .  "  And I appreciate this moment to come up on this stage with so many people who ' ve already given me so much solace , and just say to TEDsters : I ' m proud of me . That I take something bad , I turn it , and I ' m going to make something good out of this , all these pieces.
The negatives are gone.
That ' s my house.
My son , Davey , in the hotel two nights ago.
Thank you everybody.

Which , of course , I am not agreeing with because , although I am 94 , I am not still working.
I have my file which is called To Do . I have my plans.
This was about 1925.
This is now for sale at the Metropolitan Museum.
I made hundreds of them for the last 75 years.
Novelty is a concept of commerce , not an aesthetic concept.
I have so much to say . I have to think what I am going to say.
These are tiles . The word ,  " playful "  is a necessary aspect of our work because , actually , one of our problems is that we have to make , produce , lovely things throughout all of life , and this for me is now 75 years.
As I said , I started to do these things 75 years ago.
I was incredibly curious to see the world , and I made all these things , which then finally did take me to see many countries and many cultures.
The work as an apprentice was very primitive.
And then finally it was prepared for the throwing.
I also got at the time a workbook which explained my rights and my working conditions , and I still have that workbook.
However , after a while there was a new factory being built in Budapest , a pottery factory , a large one.
So he asked me , could he please visit me , and then finally he did , and explained to me that what I did now in my shop was an anachronism , that the industrial revolution had broken out , and that I rather should join the factory.
I remember that it was quite successful.
And I got several answers , and I accepted the one which was farthest from home and practically , I thought , halfway to America.
So I doused him in cologne every day , which he thought was very nice , and therefore he brought bread and butter every day , which I had to eat out of courtesy.
This was my first job.
Moderator : Yes , I am sure.
I was finally there , although I had nothing to do -- I was a foreign expert.
This was a very dangerous accusation.
EZ : Oh , this summer , in fact , the Lomonosov factory was bought by an American company , invited me.
Here I am now , if this is the end ?  Thank you.

It also changed our lives in many unexpected ways , and those unexpected ways we later reflected on , that eventually spawned a business idea between the two of us , and a year later , we launched Babble , a website for parents.
RG : We were at the time running a very different kind of website.
But you can understand the jokes that we get . Sex begets babies.
It seems to us that when people start dissembling , people start lying about things , that ' s when it gets really interesting.
And we feel like some of that difficulty was because of this false advertisement around parenting.
I would always be perfectly coiffed and well rested , and in fact , it was not like that at all.
AV : Yes , you can see where the disconnect was happening for us.
And of course , there are many more than four things you can ' t say about parenting , but we would like to share with you today four that are particularly relevant for us personally.
AV : We , or I ? 
And I was there with my arms open.
And instead , when the baby was placed in my hands , it was an extraordinary moment.
And it was also , of course , surreal.
But what I felt towards the child at that moment was deep affection , but nothing like what I feel for him now , five years later.
You ' re not allowed to chart love.
And I think the reality is that love is a process , and I think the problem with thinking of love as something that ' s binary is that it causes us to be unduly concerned that love is fraudulent , or inadequate , or what have you.
But we like to joke , in the first few months of all of our children ' s lives , this is Uncle Rufus.
RG : Uh oh.
RG : The far left . AV : No!
You can ' t talk about how lonely having a baby can be.
I felt like I was a vessel of the future of humanity.
I did expect it to be difficult , have sleepless nights , constant feedings , but I did not expect the feelings of isolation and loneliness that I experienced , and I was really surprised that no one had talked to me , that I was going to be feeling this way.
And that this , of course , one of the themes for us is that we think that candor and brutal honesty is critical to us collectively being great parents.
Of those , 67 percent are most lonely when their kids are zero to five -- probably really zero to two.
AV : So taboo number three : you can ' t talk about your miscarriage -- but today I ' ll talk about mine.
This is actually the last little image we have of him.
And I realize , I think , the way I was feeling that way , is on a really deep gut level , I was feeling a lot of shame and embarrassed , frankly , that , in some respects , I had failed at delivering what I ' m genetically engineered to do.
I was really amazed by all the stories that started flooding in.
There ' s not really a lot of community support around it.
Fifteen to 20 percent of all pregnancies result in miscarriage , and I find this astounding.
The party line is that every single aspect of my life has just gotten dramatically better ever since I participated in the miracle that is childbirth and family.
Basically , there ' s this precipitous drop of marital satisfaction , which is closely aligned , we all know , with broader happiness , that doesn ' t rise again until your first child goes to college.
So we really wanted to take a deeper look at it in hopes that we would find a silver lining.
It can ' t possibly be that bad.
And so we all remember as children , the tiniest little thing -- and we see it on the faces of our children -- the teeniest little thing can just rocket them to these heights of just utter adulation , and then the next teeniest little thing can cause them just to plummet to the depths of despair.
And part of what happens , I think , in your  ' 20s and  ' 30s , is you start to learn to hedge your happiness.
So your average happiness goes up , but you lose those transcendent moments.
We trade the sort of security and safety of a certain level of contentment for these transcendent moments.
AV : A quick bonus taboo for you , that we should not be working together , especially with three children -- and we are.
It ' s a bad idea . Don ' t do it. " 
And so the final question that we would ask is : can we collectively bend that happiness chart upwards ? 
AV : And we kind of feel that the happiness gap , which we talked about , is really the result of walking into parenting -- and really any long-term partnership for that matter -- with the wrong expectations.
And trekking in Nepal is an extraordinary experience , particularly if you pack your bags properly and you know what you ' re getting in for and you ' re psyched.
Imagine hearing great , departed pianists play again today , just as they would in person . John Q . Walker demonstrates how recordings can be analyzed for precise keystrokes and pedal motions , then played back on computer-controlled grand pianos.
Ninety-nine percent of us have the dream of listeners.
And we go to live concerts , and we get that as much as we can.
Let ' s separate the performance , as a thing , out from the recording , which was how it was made.
In order to do this , it ' s a lot of hardware and software that runs in a very high resolution.
And we were able to cross this line , called the uncanny valley , in terms of -- artificial intelligence terms.
And , you know , it ' s a thing your piano teacher teaches you , but we never had a science behind these kinds of things.
He just got tired of being in front of an audience , and felt like -- a performing monkey was , in fact , his term.
Bach only wrote themes and variations one time.
And the one in mono , by the way , he used the pedal , and as he got older , he said ,  " No , no , wait a minute.
How about that ? 
We can play the original in one ear , and a new recording in the other.
Before  " Jurassic Park, "  there was no science for how skin hung off of muscle , right ? 
Ultimately , I started with the experience.
And I got to tell you , if you haven ' t heard high-definition surround , go down to your audio dealer , your audiophile dealer.
And you could listen in headphones with this thing called binaural recording.
Except now you ' re inside Glenn Gould ' s body playing the piano , and it feels like your fingers are making the decisions and moving through the whole process.
What you heard today was not perfect.
Without putting dates next to these things , step-by-step music will be turned into data , like every field that ' s occurred in the past 35 or 40 years.
Your eyes are pretty happy with some color and movement , you know.
And at some point he ' s dancing with his -- and I won ' t ruin the episode for you , from 1967.
That ' s where I ' m at.
It ' s now coming in this world.
Because what you ' ve just heard was a computer playing data -- no Glenn Gould in the room.
Wouldn ' t it be cool if every time you listened , it could be different ? 
We ' ve seen all these  " Star Treks, "  and they ' re all holodeck episodes as well.
It ' s a way better experience than whatever you ' re used to listening to , in whatever form.
It was a concert he recorded in the Shrine Auditorium in 1949.
And we put the piano on the sweet spot of the stage in the Shrine , which has not changed since 1949 , still seats 6,000 people.
And I want you to hear that right now.
It ' s an Irish jig , and I want you to hear his humor.
As we reboot the world ' s economy , Geoff Mulgan poses a question : Instead of sending bailout money to doomed old industries , why not use stimulus funds to bootstrap some new , socially responsible companies -- and make the world a little bit better ? 
It ' s hard to believe that it ' s less than a year since the extraordinary moment when the finance , the credit , which drives our economies froze.
And it ' s only a few months since governments injected enormous sums of money to try and keep the whole system afloat.
What I ' m going to try and do is to give some pointers to what I think is the landscape on the other side of the crisis , what things we should be looking out for and how we can actually use the crisis.
I ' ve got a very confused background which perhaps makes me appropriate for confused times.
But what I want to talk about begins when I was at this city , this university , as a student.
And they were people who were not short of wit , or grace or energy , but they had no hope , no jobs , no prospects.
Now , since that time , we ' ve actually been through an extraordinary boom , the longest boom ever in the history of this country.
Rates of depression carried on up , right across the Western world.
We ' re now at another moment when another wave of teenagers are entering a cruel job market.
They bring ideas from the margins into the mainstream.
You can see it in daily life.
A few of these . This is Atilla the hen.
Ronald Reagan , again , said the two funniest sentences in the English language are ,  " I ' m from the government . And I ' m here to help. " 
How much of the money is going into concrete and boosting consumption , not into solving the really profound problems we have to solve.
Don ' t overdo it. " 
Some , I think some of the bankers who have appear to have learned nothing and forgotten nothing.
Education : six , seven , eight percent of the economy and growing.
We know we can ' t go back to where we were before the crisis.
Our societies now spend two , three , four percent of GDP to invest systematically in new discovery , in science , in technology , to fuel the pipeline of brilliant inventions which illuminate gatherings like this.
He had helped shape Britain ' s post-war institutions , its welfare state , its economy , but had sort of reinvented himself as a social entrepreneur , became an inventor of many , many different organizations.
And his life was a systematic experiment to find better social answers , not from a theory , but from experiment , and experiment involving the people with the best intelligence on social needs , which were usually the people living with those needs.
And we find ourselves part of a very rapidly growing global movement of institutions working on social innovation , using ideas from design or technology or community organizing to develop the germs of a future world , but through practice and through demonstration and not through theory.
These are complaints choirs.
Now , the idea that all of this represents , I think , is rapidly becoming a common sense and part of how we respond to the crisis , recognizing the need to invest in innovation for social progress as well as technological progress.
And what people are beginning to ask is : Surely , just as we invest in R and D , two , three , four percent , of our GDP , of our economy , what if we put , let ' s say , one percent of public spending into social innovation , into elder care , new kinds of education , new ways of helping the disabled ? 
Now , I want to end by saying a little bit about what I think this means for capitalism.
It ' s already immersed in social networks.
In recent years , a lot of intelligent people thought that capitalism had basically won.
We were naturally deferential . We needed hierarchy.
And whereas then monarchies , palaces and forts dominated every city skyline and looked permanent and confident , today it ' s the gleaming towers of the banks which dominate every big city.
It depends on other systems , on ecology , on family , on community , and if these aren ' t replenished , capitalism suffers too.
The crisis is almost certainly deepening around us.
What can economists learn from linguists ?  Behavioral economist Keith Chen introduces a fascinating pattern from his research : that languages without a concept for the future --  " It rain tomorrow, "  instead of  " It will rain tomorrow "  -- correlate strongly with high savings rates . <a href= " http://blog.ted.com/2013/02/19/saving-for-a-rainy-day-keith-chen-on-language-that-forecasts-weather-and-behavior/ "  target= " _blank " >Read more about Chen’s explorations &raquo</a>
The global economic financial crisis has reignited public interest in something that ' s actually one of the oldest questions in economics , dating back to at least before Adam Smith.
Let me tell you a little bit about savings rates , a little bit about language , and then I ' ll draw that connection.
Despite all of these similarities , we see huge differences in savings behavior.
It should be noted , of course , that the United States and the U.K . are the next in line.
And then I ' ll draw the connection between these two behaviors.
Now , how might that be ?  Let me give you an example.
I wouldn ' t have been able to convey so little information.
And in fact , if I want to speak correctly , Chinese forces me to constantly think about it.
Why ?  Because I have to consider that and I have to modify what I ' m saying to say ,  " It will rain, "  or  " It ' s going to rain. " 
They can say ,  " Yesterday it rain, "   " Now it rain, "   " Tomorrow it rain. " 
So many of you know , in this room , that English is a Germanic language.
This led me , as a behavioral economist , to an intriguing hypothesis.
Now suppose that that visceral difference makes you subtly dissociate the future from the present every time you speak.
Now this is a fanciful theory.
And interestingly enough , there are pockets of futureless language speakers situated all over the world.
What you see is that these bars are systematically taller and systematically shifted to the left compared to these bars which are the members of the OECD that speak futured languages.
Now while these findings are suggestive , countries can be different in so many different ways that it ' s very , very difficult sometimes to account for all of these possible differences.
One way to imagine that is I gather large datasets from around the world.
 " Excuse me , would you mind if I peruse your stock portfolio ? 
Would you mind squeezing as hard as you can , in your dominant hand , this device so I can measure your grip strength ? 
Combine that with a world value survey , which measures the political opinions and , fortunately for me , the savings behaviors of millions of families in hundreds of countries around the world.
What are the characteristics we can control for ? 
There are 1.4 billion different ways that a family can find itself.
Yes , futureless language speakers , even after this level of control , are 30 percent more likely to report having saved in any given year.
Yes , because I just told you , we actually collect a lot of health data as economists.
If savings is current pain in exchange for future pleasure , smoking is just the opposite.
Futureless language speakers are 20 to 24 percent less likely to be smoking at any given point in time compared to identical families , and they ' re going to be 13 to 17 percent less likely to be obese by the time they retire , and they ' re going to report being 21 percent more likely to have used a condom in their last sexual encounter.
Ultimately , the goal , once we understand how these subtle effects can change our decision making , we want to be able to provide people tools so that they can consciously make themselves better savers and more conscious investors in their own future.

I get that all the time in Dubai.
Well actually , I hope for a while longer yet.
And I want to talk to you today about language loss and the globalization of English.
How did those students get all that knowledge ? 
A language dies every 14 days.
But I do know that I ' ve seen a lot of changes.
But nevertheless , I was recruited by the British Council , along with about 25 other teachers.
Now this is the major change that I ' ve seen -- how teaching English has morphed from being a mutually beneficial practice to becoming a massive international business that it is today.
So everybody wants to have an English education , naturally.
Would he need the same language as a lawyer , for example ? 
They can ' t pursue their dream any longer ,  ' til they get English.
We English teachers are the gatekeepers.
Okay.
It feeds the English requirement.
They translated from Latin and Greek into Arabic , into Persian , and then it was translated on into the Germanic languages of Europe and the Romance languages.
We need one today more than ever.
This system equates intelligence with a knowledge of English , which is quite arbitrary.
But fortunately for the world , he did not have to pass an English test.
And millions and millions of students take these tests every year.
Now I get it , I understand why people would want to focus on English.
It ' s a circular thing.
But they couldn ' t get the results they wanted.
But if another language can think that thought , then , by cooperating , we can achieve and learn so much more.
She had to translate it into English at her grammar school.
This is -- I don ' t know if you saw it on CNN recently -- they gave the Heroes Award to a young Kenyan shepherd boy who couldn ' t study at night in his village , like all the village children , because the kerosene lamp , it had smoke and it damaged his eyes.
When he received his award , he said these lovely words :  " The children can lead Africa from what it is today , a dark continent , to a light continent. " 
Let us celebrate diversity.
Paul MacCready -- aircraft designer , environmentalist , and lifelong lover of flight -- talks about his long career.
I am known best for human-powered flight , but that was just one thing that got me going in the sort of things that I ' m working in now.
The weather modification subject was getting started , and as a graduate student , I could go around to the various talks that were being given , on a hitchhiker ride to the East Coast , and so on . And everybody would talk to me , but all the professionals in the field hated each other , and they wouldn ' t communicate . And as a result , I got the absolutely unique background in that field , and started a company , which did more research in weather modification than anybody , and there are a lot of things that I just can ' t go into.
He needed them -- he needed the money for starting a company.
But that began thinking about how birds went around , and then how airplanes would , how hang gliders would fly , and then other planes , and the idea of the Gossamer-Condor-type airplane quickly emerged , was so logical , one should have thought of it in the first place , but one didn ' t . And it was just , keep the weight down -- 70 pounds was all it weighed -- but let the size swell up , like a hang glider , but three times the span , three times the cord.
And there was only about 30 to help retire the debt.
And Brian Allen was able , in a miraculous flight , to get the Gossamer Albatross across the English Channel , and we won the 100,000-pound , 200,000-dollar prize for that.
But that sure started me thinking about various things , and immediately , we began making a solar-powered plane because we felt solar power was going to be so important for the country and the world , we didn ' t want the small funding in the government to be decreased , which is what the government was trying to do with it.
This was the one chance that I had to focus on what I , really , was after , and what was important . And to my surprise , I realized the importance of environmental issues , which Charles Lindbergh devoted the last third of his life to , and preparing that paper did me a lot of good.
I wanted to -- well , one of the biggest changes is , 200 years ago , we began using coal from underground , which has a lot of pollution , and 100 years ago , began getting gasoline from underground , with a lot of pollution . And gasoline consumption , or production , will reach its limit in about ten years , and then go down , and we wonder what ' s going to happen with transportation.
Humans and muskrats and giraffes and birds and so on , are -- the red line goes up . That ' s the humans and livestock and pets portion.
Ten thousand years ago , the humans and livestock and pets were not even one tenth of one percent and wouldn ' t even have been visible on such a curve.
What ' s the population of the Earth going to be when you ' re the age of your parents ? 
Rachel Carson was thinking of these , and came out with  " Silent Spring, "  way back.
So this just summarizes it .  " Over billions of years , on a unique sphere , chance has painted a thin covering of life -- complex and probable , wonderful and fragile.
And [it] shows the Earth in a time flag : on the right , in trilobites and dinosaurs and so on ; and over the triangle , we now get to civilization and TV and traffic jams and so on.
As time went on , we stopped our environmental programs.
I have a Helios . We have the first video.
Paul MacCready : The wings could touch together on top and not break . We think.
This is more than 10,000 feet higher than the previous world ' s altitude record held by the SR-71 Blackbird.
Narrator : A tiny airplane , the AV Pointer serves for surveillance.
It sends high-resolution video pictures back to the operator.
Let ' s have the next video.
AA : When they got bored with their father ' s project , they invented an extraordinary little plane of their own.
How old were you when you invented that ? 
TM : All right . You all got a couple of these in your gift bags , and one of the first things , the production version seemed to dive a little bit , and so I would just suggest you bend the wing tips up a little bit before you try flying it.
And so you just keep the glider positioned in that up current.
Okay , this one will be a left turn.
This was flying around in the party last night , and -- -- you can see how it just can fly around , and you can spy on anybody you want.

Charles Leadbeater on innovation
Another answer might be , well , it came from a sort of lone genius working in his garage , who , working away on different kinds of bikes , comes up with a bike out of thin air.
And for the first , I don ' t know , three to five years of their life , mountain bikes were known as  " clunkers. " 
That ' s 58 billion dollars.
And out of that , you get the need for the kind of things that Jimmy was talking about , which is our new kinds of organization , or a better way to put it : how do we organize ourselves without organizations ? 
Special people , special places , think up special ideas , then you have a pipeline that takes the ideas down to the waiting consumers , who are passive.
More special people , more special places.
I think it ' s always been wrong , because I think always creativity has been highly collaborative , and it ' s probably been largely interactive.
The payoffs to innovation are greatest where the uncertainty is highest.
When the mobile telephone companies invented SMS , they had no idea what it was for ; it was only when that technology got into the hands of teenage users that they invented the use.
It will be worked out in use , in collaboration with users.
If you want to find the big new ideas , it ' s often difficult to find them in mainstream markets , in big organizations.
Do you go into your board and say ,  " Look , I ' ve got a fantastic idea for an embryonic product in a marginal market , with consumers we ' ve never dealt with before , and I ' m not sure it ' s going to have a big payoff , but it could be really , really big in the future ?  " 
Best example : who in the music industry , 30 years ago , would have said ,  " Yes , let ' s invent a musical form which is all about dispossessed black men in ghettos expressing their frustration with the world through a form of music that many people find initially quite difficult to listen to.
They do it on their own tapes , with their own recording equipment ; they distribute it themselves.
And across a whole range of fields -- from software , astronomy , natural sciences , vast areas of leisure and culture like kite-surfing , so on and so forth -- you find people who want to do things because they love it , but they want to do these things to very high standards.
More knowledgeable consumers , more educated , more able to connect with one another , more able to do things together.
This has huge organizational implications for very large areas of life.
And it was huge -- it was absolutely enormous.
What does this mean , then , for our organizational landscape ? 
This is open ; this is closed.
And so the debates about copyright , digital rights , so on and so forth -- these are all about trying to stifle , in my view , these kinds of organizations.
The first is : imagine yourself going to a venture capitalist and saying ,  " I ' ve got a fantastic idea.
So , there is a huge competitive argument about sustaining the capacity for open-source and consumer-driven innovation , because it ' s one of the greatest competitive levers against monopoly.
And you ' d kind of look over their shoulder on the Tube to see if they were reading your article.
Or the op-ed page , where if they knew the editor -- had been to school with him , slept with his wife -- they could write an article for the op-ed page.
But they don ' t want to be journalists . The journalists think that the bloggers want to be journalists ; they don ' t want to be journalists ; they just want to have a voice.
So , there ' s going to be a tremendous struggle.
If this is so critical , do we not need it funded , organized , supported in much more structured ways ? 
What should be the role of public policy ? 
It won ' t be so clear-cut ; it won ' t be Microsoft versus Linux -- there ' ll be all sorts of things in between.
And I was having dinner with this guy called Timothy Chan.
9,000 servers all over China , has 250 million subscribers.
Well , how can he service 250 million people from 500 employees ? 
And it creates a kind of stickiness between the community and the company which is really , really powerful.
One option : you can create a new character , right from scratch , but with none of the history of your player.
So this is about companies built on communities , that provide communities with tools , resources , platforms in which they can share.
Imagine you could take all the children in education in Britain , and one percent of them were co-developers of education.
And one of the reasons they do that is that they turn users into producers , consumers into designers.
677
He experiences himself , his thoughts and feelings , as something separated from the rest , a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness.
It pairs closely with love , which is the will for the other to be happy , which requires , of course , that one feels some happiness oneself and wishes to share it.
Compassion helps him turn away from the feeling of his suffering as the most absolute , most terrible suffering anyone has ever had and broadens his awareness of the sufferings of others , even of the perpetrators of his misery and the whole mass of beings.
Thus , he uses his own suffering as a doorway to widening his circle of compassion.
And he was discontented with the state of people ' s practice of the Buddhist religion in India at that time.
I know the next Buddha will come a few thousand years from now , but exists currently in a certain heaven "  -- that ' s Maitreya --  " so , I ' m going to go on a retreat and I ' m going to meditate and pray until the Buddha Maitreya reveals himself to me , and gives me a teaching or something to revive the practice of compassion in the world today. " 
And he had a lump of iron.
And the man said ,  " I ' m making a needle. " 
He went back to his cave . He meditated again.
And where it ' s landing to bring the twigs to the cliff , its feathers brushes the rock -- and it had cut the rock six to eight inches in . There was a cleft in the rock by the brushing of the feathers of generations of the birds.
And he again leaves , and this time : water dripping , making a giant bowl in the rock where it drips in a stream.
And there , in the town , he ' s approached by a dog who comes like this -- one of these terrible dogs you can see in some poor countries , even in America , I think , in some areas -- and he ' s looking just terrible.
He thinks ,  " What can I do to fix up this dog ? 
And they ' re maggoting happily in the dog ' s hindquarters there.
So , he had a brilliant idea.
So he thought ,  " I will take the maggots and put them on this piece of flesh , then clean the dog ' s wounds , and then I ' ll figure out what to do with the maggots. " 
And then the maggots will jump on my warmer tongue "  -- the dog is kind of used up --  " and then I ' ll spit them one by one down on the thing. " 
He jumps back and there , of course , is the future Buddha Maitreya in a beautiful vision -- rainbow lights , golden , jeweled , a plasma body , an exquisite mystic vision -- that he sees.
What is this ?  " 
And , until you have real compassion , you cannot recognize love. " 
And so he took the Maitreya -- it shrunk into a globe , a ball -- took him on his shoulder.
So , naturally , they chased him out of town.
And Maitreya then kept him in heaven for five years , dictating to him five complicated tomes of the methodology of how you cultivate compassion.
The animals are in one of their human lives . The humans are human.
But , you know , after all , they ' re nice to me.
While the neutral ones I don ' t know . They could all be just fine.
Therefore all of you , in the Buddhist view , in some previous life , although you don ' t remember it and neither do I , have been my mother -- for which I do apologize for the trouble I caused you.
You gave me that expression ;  " the eternal mama, "  you said . That ' s wonderful.
So , they first create this foundation of equality.
And then the next thing we do is what is called  " mother recognition. " 
We see that look that the mother has on her face , looking at this child that is a miracle that she has produced from her own body , being a mammal , where she has true compassion , truly is the other , and identifies completely.
And so , we reflect until we can sort of see that motherly expression in all beings.
And you think of him as nursing you.
You can feel the familiarity of all beings.
And you begin to get very sentimental ; you cultivate sentimentality intensely.
And then , third , you step from there to what is called  " a feeling of gratitude. " 
And then you think of how lovely beings are when they are happy , when they are satisfied.
And you feel a love toward them and you want them to be happy , even the enemy.
If you love your enemy that means you want your enemy to be happy.
So it makes sense to want your enemy to be happy , because they ' ll stop being your enemy because that ' s too much trouble.
And you realize how unhappy they are actually , mostly , most of the time.
 " I have to get that . I need more . I ' m not worthy . And I should do something. " 
And , of course , they are cruel and ruthless toward others.
And you then feel you must act.
And so the next step -- the sixth step beyond  " universal compassion "  -- is this thing where you ' re linked with the needs of others in a true way , and you have compassion for yourself also , and it isn ' t sentimental only . You might be in fear of something.
And materialism , they think they get out of it just by not existing , by dying , but they don ' t.
And that is very important -- the Charter of Compassion must lead us to develop through true compassion , what is called  " universal responsibility. " 
We absolutely must do that . There is no way not to do it.
The first person who is happy when you get great compassion is yourself , even if you haven ' t done anything yet for anybody else.
Don ' t just think ,  " Well , I ' m compassionate, "  or  " I ' m not compassionate, "  and sort of think you ' re stuck there.
Simplicity : We know it when we see it -- but what is it , exactly ?  In this funny , philosophical talk , George Whitesides chisels out an answer.
Most of the talks that you ' ve heard in the last several fabulous days have been from people who have the characteristic that they have thought about something , they are experts , they know what ' s going on.
And what I ' m going to do is share with you my ignorance on this subject.
But I know it when I see it. " 
A coffee cup -- we don ' t think about coffee cups , but it ' s much more interesting than one might think -- a coffee cup is a device , which has a container and a handle.
But also , by the way , the coffee is hot , the liquid is sterile ; you ' re not likely to get cholera that way.
Simple in function , but not at all simple in how they ' re constructed.
And the other , of course , is a birth control pill , which , in a very simple way , fundamentally changed the structure of society by changing the role of women in it by providing to them the opportunity to make reproductive choices.
The teapot problem I ' ll pose this way.
It ' s like , what is simplicity ? 
And , since this is coming from a moral philosopher , the fourth would be that it ' s part of God ' s plan for the universe.
What is the state of science ? 
We academics -- I am an academic -- we love complexity.
So what one is interested in has a lot to do with the rewards of the system.
All right , what is complexity in this view of things , and what is emergence ? 
These are cars and drivers . They dissipate energy.
And it ' s like the traffic that you see.
We ' ve heard from Bill Gates recently.
That ' s a Bono , this is a Bono.
Now , imagine building that up to a city , or to a society , and you ' ve got , obviously , an interesting problem.
Or I ' m going to use simple to mean reliable , predictable , repeatable.
And if you look at the list of things on the bottom , we are familiar with the Arabic numbers one to 10 and so on.
The virtue of binary is that it ' s the simplest possible way of representing numbers.
Now , if you like to represent this zero and one of binary , you need a device.
But our friends who are condensed matter physicists managed to come up , some 50 years ago , with a very nice device , shown under that bell jar , which is a transistor.
So , since the transistor is so simple , you can put lots of them together.
With integrated circuits , you can build cellphones.
And from that comes the Internet.
So here we have what I think is one of the great ideas , which is Google.
The characteristics , which I think are useful to think about for simple things : First , they are predictable.
The second is , and this is a real world statement , they ' re cheap.
You carve them in blocks and then you pile them on top of one another , and they support weight.
That is , you can stack them.
There ' s no way of predicting the Internet based on the first transistor.
We are very interested in delivering health care in the developing world , and one of the things that we wish to do in this particular business is to find a way of doing medical diagnosis at as close to zero cost as we can manage.
It ' s a little paper chip.
You know , no power required.
If we can pull this off , if we can build more function , it will be stackable.
One of them is from Mr . Einstein , and he says ,  " Everything should be made as simple as possible , but not simpler. " 
So you can ' t make it too simple.
And that certainly is going in the right direction.
Chris Anderson : Quick question.
I mean , with the health system , you got a sort of radical solution on the cost side , but in terms of the system itself ? 
CA : So , in terms of that diagnostic technology that you ' ve got , where is that , and when do you see that maybe getting rolled out to scale.
CA : All right . Well , thank you so much for your talk . Thank you.

Do you see ? 
Through that , I connect to people.
And people started laying bread in tribute , and eventually a team was able to do it between New Zealand and Spain.
This is the same person -- top photo , James , bottom photo , [Jennifer].
My favorite of these photos , which I couldn ' t find , is there ' s a picture of a 30 year-old woman or so with a little baby on her lap , and the next photo is a 220-lb man with a tiny , little old lady peaking over his shoulder.
Somebody said ,  " You have to listen to this. " 
So I was led to write this song just for her , just to give her some encouragement while dealing with stress and pressures on her job.
And let it give you some strength to get the next few moments on your job.
So I was so moved by this -- this is incredible . This was connecting , right.
And I asked my audience , I said ,  " Listen to this piece of audio.
Hundreds of remixes came back -- lots of different attempts.
That song -- Thank you.
And the audience came together , and they designed an album cover.
I heard you were looking for me. " 
So but anyways , here ' s the thing -- is it reminds me of this , which is a sign that you see in Amsterdam on every street corner.
On street corners everywhere , people are looking at their cell phones , and it ' s easy to dismiss this as some sort of bad trend in human culture.
It ' s the fundamental force that we ' re all after.
I think , of the people that build all this technology in the network , a lot of them aren ' t very good at connecting with people.
A Childhood Walk , which is a project where I ask people to remember a walk that they used to take as a child over and over again that was sort of meaningless -- like on the route to the bus stop , to a neighbor ' s house , and take it inside of Google Streetview.
 " Right after he told me and my brother he was going to be separating from my mom , I remember walking to a convenience store and getting a cherry cola. " 
It had  ' Chad '  written in magic marker on it.
Right after September 11th , last year , I was thinking about pain and the way that we disperse it , the way that we excise it from our bodies.
I ' m not alone , and I am loved.
Like even people in convenience stores saying ,  " Have a nice day, "  when they ' re accidentally looking me in the eye.
You can look at it online.
And so some really nice things came together.
Some came from the winning party.
But the truth was that as this start becoming popular , a couple rightwing blogs and some message boards apparently found it to be a little patronizing , which I could also see.
Just in case I thought the real Batman was coming after me ; which actually made me feel a little better -- like ,  " Phew , it ' s not him. " 
And I asked people to send me beautiful things made out of the Angrigami.
The last thing I ' m going to tell you about is a series of projects called Songs You Already Know , where the idea was , I was trying to figure out to address particular kinds of emotions with group projects.
And this was  " Scared. " 
And then I got this email . And there ' s a little bit of a back story to this.
And I got a lot , like 30 in a half an hour.
And the person who didn ' t , it turned out , had just moved to a new city and taken on a new job.
But anyway , this same person , Laura , ended up emailing me a little bit after that project.
So I asked her ,  " What does it feel like when you feel this way ?  " 
And so quietly in the background , I started sending people this.
But what ' s awesome is , as I started getting more and more and more of them , all of a sudden I had 30 , 40 voices from around the world.
I just want to say thanks for even considering it. " 
Psychopathic killers are the basis for some must-watch TV , but what really makes them tick ?  Neuroscientist Jim Fallon talks about brain scans and genetic analysis that may uncover the rotten wiring in the nature of murderers . In a too-strange-for-fiction twist , he shares a fascinating family history that makes his work chillingly personal.
I ' m a neuroscientist , a professor at the University of California.
And it all grew out of one of my colleagues asking me to analyze a bunch of brains of psychopathic killers.
And so some of the brains that I ' ve studied are people you know about.
And what came up was a number of pieces of data.
And how you end up with a psychopath , and a killer , depends on exactly when the damage occurs.
The pattern is that those people , every one of them I looked at , who was a murderer , and was a serial killer , had damage to their orbital cortex , which is right above the eyes , the orbits , and also the interior part of the temporal lobe.
And there is a variant of this gene that is in the normal population.
Because a daughter can get one X from the father , one X from the mother , it ' s kind of diluted out.
But if you have this gene , in utero your brain is bathed in this , so your whole brain becomes insensitive to serotonin , so it doesn ' t work later on in life.
Right ?  That ' s how the mirror neuron system works.
Well what the problem is this tends to concentrate these genes.
But then my mother said to me ,  " I hear you ' ve been going around talking about psychopathic killers.
Now she blamed this on my father ' s side , of course.
But the bad news is that your cousin is also Lizzie Borden.
And the first murder of a mother by a son was my great-great-great-great-great-great-grandfather.
There were seven more men , on my father ' s side , starting then , Cornells , that were all murderers.
So the moral of the story is : people in glass houses shouldn ' t throw stones.
But our grandkids are going to be kind of concerned here.
They have the same brain , and the same EEG.
So that ' s my talk.
253
It ' s the biggest scientific experiment ever attempted.
And we collide them with another beam of protons going in the opposite direction.
You get some sense of the size -- you can just see these EU standard-size people underneath.
This is a picture about a year ago.
And actually , this morning , I got an email saying that we ' ve just finished , today , building the last piece of ATLAS.
Why create the conditions that were present less than a billionth of a second after the universe began ?  " 
Absolutely everything.
Now , there ' s no real reason I ' m aware of for that , but that seems to be the case.
It ' s almost like ...
Just 12 particles of matter , stuck together by four forces of nature.
And these guys , here , they ' re the weak nuclear force , probably the least familiar.
But you don ' t feel them , because the weak force is correctly named -- very short range and very weak , so they just fly through you.
Relative to the universe , it ' s just up the road.
So , 100 billion galaxies , 13.7 billion light years away -- a step in size from that to Monterey , actually , is about the same as from Monterey to these things.
But what he meant was that what we ' ve done , really , is stamp collect there.
It ' s called the standard model -- beautifully simple mathematical equation.
This equation , though , allows you to calculate everything -- other than gravity -- that happens in the universe.
Can anyone see what it is ? 
So those Ws there refer to the Ws , and how they stick together.
H stands for Higgs particle.
So it ' s a prediction : a prediction of a new particle.
I want to know what this Higgs particle does. " 
Higgs particles , if you will.
Then everyone ignores them . They can just pass through the room very quickly , essentially at the speed of light . They ' re massless.
And that ' s exactly the way the Higgs mechanism works.
If it ' s not true -- because it ' s quite a convoluted mechanism , although it ' s the simplest we ' ve been able to think of -- then whatever does the job of the Higgs particles we know have to turn up at the LHC.
So that ' s one thing.
There ' s another issue , which is that the forces in nature -- it ' s quite beautiful , actually -- seem , as you go back in time , they seem to change in strength.
It ' s almost as if there was one beautiful kind of super-force , back at the beginning of time.
Also , those super-symmetric particles are very strong candidates for the dark matter.
But in the last few minutes , I just want to give you a different perspective of what I think -- what particle physics really means to me -- particle physics and cosmology.
The story goes like this : we know that the universe began 13.7 billion years ago , in an immensely hot , dense state , much smaller than a single atom.
In about the first billionth of a second or so , the Higgs field kicked in , and the quarks and the gluons and the electrons that make us up got mass.
It continued to expand about 300 million years.
So the elements of life -- carbon , and oxygen and iron , all the elements that we need to make us up -- were cooked in those first generations of stars , which then ran out of fuel , exploded , threw those elements back into the universe.
And built this civilization , this wonderful picture , that turned the darkness into light , and you can see the civilization from space.
So , the right laws of physics -- they ' re beautifully balanced.
It makes me really feel that that civilization -- which , as I say , if you believe the scientific creation story , has emerged purely as a result of the laws of physics , and a few hydrogen atoms -- then I think , to me anyway , it makes me feel incredibly valuable.
http://www.ted.com/talks/ron_gutman_the_hidden_power_of_smiling.html
Ron Gutman : The hidden power of smiling
So I used to embark on these imaginary journeys to find intergalactic objects from planet Krypton , which was a lot of fun , but didn ' t get much result.
In another yearbook , I stumbled upon Barry Obama ' s picture.
The researchers found that the span of a player ' s smile could actually predict the span of his life.
When they ' re born , babies continue to smile -- initially , mostly in their sleep.
So from Papua New Guinea to Hollywood all the way to modern art in Beijing , we smile often , and you smile to express joy and satisfaction.
In fact , those with the most amazing superpowers are actually children , who smile as many as 400 times per day.
Because smiling is evolutionarily contagious , and it suppresses the control we usually have on our facial muscles.
In addition to theorizing on evolution in  " The Origin of Species, "  Charles Darwin also wrote the facial feedback response theory.
In a related German study , researchers used fMRI imaging to measure brain activity before and after injecting Botox to suppress smiling muscles.
Wait . The same study found that smiling is as stimulating as receiving up to 16,000 pounds Sterling in cash.
And , unlike lots of chocolate , lots of smiling can actually make you healthier.
So whenever you want to look great and competent , reduce your stress or improve your marriage , or feel as if you just had a whole stack of high-quality chocolate -- without incurring the caloric cost -- or as if you found 25 grand in a pocket of an old jacket you hadn ' t worn for ages , or whenever you want to tap into a superpower that will help you and everyone around you live a longer , healthier , happier life , smile.

Because I really believe that we ' re never more beautiful than when we ' re most ugly.
But what I ' ve come to learn is that the world is never saved in grand messianic gestures , but in the simple accumulation of gentle , soft , almost invisible acts of compassion , everyday acts of compassion.
I don ' t really see it , I don ' t pay attention to it until there ' s , you know , like a bug that ' s dead on the window.
It ' s really very simple , but really very complicated.
My mother was English.
She came out to California , to Los Angeles , to visit me , and we went to Malibu , which she thought was very disappointing.
And my mother turned to me and said ,  " What language is he speaking ?  " 
But her Igbo wasn ' t too good.
And ,  " Do you notice any discharges ?  " 
My mother said ,  " Someone has to. " 
At every single refugee camp , she has to face off soldiers who want to take my elder brother Mark , who was nine , and make him a boy soldier.
And she told this woman.
But the simple act of kindness from a complete stranger will unstitch you. " 
But when it came for harvest time , they would sing these joyful songs , that were made up of the names of every child who had been born that year.
But today , women are rebuilding Rwanda.
Their humanity never seems to matter very much to us.
And I was this weird , sensitive kid , who couldn ' t really do it , but I had to do it.
Now , when I was growing up , he used to tell me stories about how he used to bayonet people , and their intestines would fall out , but they would keep running.
Anyway , a goat ' s eyes are like a child ' s eyes.
I cried for a very long time.
Just know that it is enough sometimes to know that it is difficult. " 
So , I was about nine , and my uncle had just come back from Germany , and we had the Catholic priest over , my mother was entertaining him with tea.
Take anything you want out of the suitcase.
And Father McGetrick was completely unflustered , just stirred his tea and looked at my mother and said ,  " It ' s all right Daphne , I ' m Scottish. " 
And not everybody on death row was a political prisoner.
And when he got tired of reading them , he started to teach the men in death row how to read , with these comic books.
He didn ' t know what death row meant.
And he said ,  " Oh , I heard it on the grapevine. " 
All around us , everywhere , there are people like this.
But if the god became unruly and began to ask for human sacrifice , the Igbos would destroy the god.
It doesn ' t require a tremendous thing.
The poem is called  " Libation, "  and it ' s for my friend Vusi who is in the audience here somewhere.
He pushes his tongue through a hole where his tooth would be , if he were whole.
This is for you , old man.

No , agile aerial robots like this one.
They weigh thousands of pounds , are not by any means agile.
So these are helicopters with four rotors and they ' re roughly a meter or so in scale and weigh several pounds.
It consumes about 15 watts of power.
If you spin these rotors at the same speed , the robot hovers.
So in this picture you see that rotor four is spinning faster and rotor two is spinning slower.
So an on-board processor essentially looks at what motions need to be executed and combines these motions and figures out what commands to send to the motors 600 times a second.
It ' s actually half the diameter.
So the smaller you make R , the more dramatically the inertia reduces.
So this should be clear in these videos.
So on the left , you see Daniel throwing this robot up into the air.
Well robots like this have many applications.
I ' ll tell you a little bit more about this.
This is a picture of a recent experiment we did -- actually not so recent anymore -- in Sendai shortly after the earthquake.
In fact , they live in a 12-dimensional space.
And so what the robot does is it plans what we call a minimum snap trajectory.
And it does that avoiding obstacles.
So the robot is obviously capable of executing any curve trajectory.
And the obstacles can be moving.
So here you see the robot combining a motion that builds up momentum and then changes its orientation and then recovers.
So I want change gears.
And so here we looked to nature.
So these ants don ' t have any central coordinator.
So this is the kind of coordination we want our robots to have.
So this also has to be done in a decentralized way.
So this is what we call anonymity.
The formations can change.
So again , these robots come really close together.
So this just shows that we can double , triple , quadruple the robot strength by just getting them to team with neighbors , as you can see here.
This is work done by Quentin Lindsey who ' s a graduate student.
And again , everything is autonomous , and all Quentin has to do is to get them a blueprint of the design that he wants to build.
So this robot is actually equipped with a camera and a laser rangefinder , laser scanner.
The coordinate system is defined based on the robot , where it is and what it ' s looking at.
It builds the map.
So suppose I were to send this into a building and I had no idea what this building looked like , I can ask this robot to go in , create a map and then come back and tell me what the building looks like.
So I want to leave you with one last application.
But we ' re in Southern California , close to Los Angeles , so I have to conclude with something focused on entertainment.
And the robots that play the video are completely autonomous.

Louise Fresco on feeding the whole world
And that is bread -- something which is as simple as our basic , most fundamental human staple.
As I will show to you , it is actually the mainstay of modern life.
I have two loaves of bread here.
Here we go . I want to see a show of hands.
Okay , now the question is really , why is this so ? 
This is an image from Tuscany , where we feel agriculture is still about beauty.
Why do we feel that this is more true than this ? 
Art has helped us to maintain that kind of image.
But we have , somehow , in the course of the last few centuries , or even decades , started to cultivate an image of a mythical , rural agricultural past.
And it actually drove up our yields.
And it means that you now eat products , which can come from all around the world.
But actually the real relevant bread , historically , is this white Wonder loaf.
This tiny bread that is tasteless in some ways and has a lot of problems has changed the world.
And the world population in the meantime has doubled.
What happened to our bread in the meantime ? 
That is , historically , a really unique situation.
And as it became cheaper , bread manufacturers decided to add in all kinds of things.
It is the basic , most fundamental food that we ' ve had in the last ten thousand years.
Bread has migrated to tropical countries , where the middle classes now eat French rolls and hamburgers and where the commuters find bread much more handy to use than rice or cassava.
But of course the price of mass production has been that we moved large-scale.
And this is where I have to query all of you.
We have become very removed from what our bread really is , which , again , evolutionarily speaking , is very strange.
This is where it all comes from , and where these farmers who actually , ten thousand years ago , put us on the road of bread.
Let ' s go back to small-scale , to farmers '  markets , small bakeries and all that. "  Wonderful.
And the fallacy comes from idealizing a past that we have forgotten about.
It ' s a luxury solution for us who can afford it , if you want to afford it.
But also we do not want to relegate to poverty in the rural areas.
The main driver of that is actually meat.
So what can we do ? 
I feel so strongly that you cannot ask a small farmer to work the land and bend over to grow a hectare of rice , 150,000 times , just to plant a crop and weed it.
We must feed three billion people in cities.
But yes there are some solutions.
What I want us to do is to keep up the science and even get more science in there but go to a kind of regional scale -- not just in terms of the scale of the fields , but in terms of the entire food network.
Agriculture science for most people -- and there are not many farmers among you here -- has this name of being bad , of being about pollution , about large-scale , about the destruction of the environment.
Well first of all I think we can do much better on the existing technologies.
We do not need to spill the water if we don ' t want to.
There are different ways in which we must use it -- for residential , for nature , for agriculture purposes.
I want to have horticulture and greenhouses on top of residential areas.
But we can do a lot more.
So we can do that . In fact in a densely populated country like the River Delta , where I live in the Netherlands , we have combined these functions.
You must go back and think about your own food chain.
Understand that you are part of this enormous chain of events.
And the kind of simplistic solutions that we sometimes have , to think that doing everything by hand is going to be the solution , is really not morally justified.
And never before have we had the luxury of taking it for granted because it is now so cheap.
Who said this so beautifully was Mahatma Gandhi , 75 years ago , when he spoke about bread.
Let me share some of the food with you.
I want you to think that every bite connects you to the past and the future : to these anonymous farmers , that first bred the first wheat varieties ; and to the farmers of today , who ' ve been making this . And you don ' t even know who they are.
We ' ve never had that before.
Dean Ornish talks about simple , low-tech and low-cost ways to take advantage of the body ' s natural desire to heal itself.
This session is on natural wonders , and the bigger conference is on the pursuit of happiness.
I love doing this work , because it really gives many people new hope and new choices that they didn’t have before , and it allows us to talk about things that -- not just diet , but that happiness is not -- we ' re talking about the pursuit of happiness , but when you really look at all the spiritual traditions , what Aldous Huxley called the  " perennial wisdom, "  when you get past the named and forms and rituals that really divide people , it’s really about -- our nature is to be happy ; our nature is to be peaceful , our nature is to be healthy.
I studied yoga for many years with a teacher named Swami Satchidananda and people would say ,  " What are you , a Hindu ?  "  He’d say ,  " No , I’m an undo. " 
And it’s not a diet.
And in our studies , what we’ve been able to do is to use very expensive , high-tech , state-of-the-art measures to prove how powerful these very simple and low-tech and low-cost -- and in many ways , ancient -- interventions , can be.
We used quantitative arteriography , showing the narrowing.
Huge differences can occur without drugs , without surgery.
This is the natural history of heart disease , but it’s really not natural because we found it could get better and better , and much more quickly than people had once thought.
The younger brother is 86 , the older one’s 95 ; they wanted to show me how much more flexible they were.
Now I thought , you know , if we just did good science , that would change medical practice . But , that was a little naive.
So , we began through our nonprofit institute ' s training hospitals around the country , and we found that most people could avoid surgery , and not only was it medically effective , it was also cost effective.
And what doesn’t work is fear of dying , and that’s what’s normally used.
As one woman said ,  " I’ve got 20 friends in this package of cigarettes , and they’re always there for me and nobody else is.
And the pain is not the problem : it’s the symptom.
What was the biggest selling drug of all time when it was introduced a few years ago ? 
It’s not so much psychological , it’s vascular , and nicotine makes your arteries constrict.
Your sexual function improves.
On a low-fat meal , the blood flow doesn’t go down -- it even goes up.
I want to talk a little bit about the obesity epidemic , because it really is a problem.
And if you see from  ' 85 to  ' 86 to  ' 87 ,  ' 88 ,  ' 89 ,  ' 90 ,  ' 91 -- you get a new category , 15 to 20 percent ;  ' 92 ,  ' 93 ,  ' 94 ,  ' 95 ,  ' 96 ,  ' 97 -- you get a new category ;  ' 98 ,  ' 99 , 2000 , and 2001.
Now , there’s no mystery in how you lose weight ; you either burn more calories by exercise or you eat fewer calories.
And fat has nine calories per gram , whereas protein and carbs only have four.
You know , I don’t like talking about the Atkins diet , but I get asked about it every day , and so I just thought I’d spend a few minutes on that.
Your pancreas makes insulin to bring it back down , which is good.
And the fiber fills you up before you get too many calories , and it slows the absorption so you don’t get that rapid rise in blood sugar.
And these are predominantly what are called the Omega-3 fatty acids.
Three grams a day . They come in one-gram capsules ; more than that just gives you extra fat you don’t need.
You want to lose weight in a way that enhances your health rather than the one that harms it.
While your cholesterol level has remained the same , the research findings have changed. " 
Now , one of the studies funded by the Atkins Center found that 70 percent of the people were constipated , 65 percent had bad breath , 54 percent had headaches – this is not a healthy way to eat.
So when you go on these kinds of diet , they begin to smell bad.
So , there are lots of reasons for eating this way that go beyond just your health.
What we found was that , after a year , none of the experimental group patients who made these lifestyle changes needed treatment , whereas six of the control-group patients needed surgery or radiation.
And in order for the PSA to go down , they had to make pretty big changes.
And this really got me excited because again , we found the same pattern : the more people change , the more it affected the growth of their tumors.
The last thing I want to talk about , apropos of the issue of the pursuit of happiness , is that study after study have shown that people who are lonely and depressed -- and depression is the other real epidemic in our culture -- are many times more likely to get sick and die prematurely , in part because , as we talked about , they’re more likely to smoke and overeat and drink too much and work too hard and so on.
It can be sexual intimacy – I happen to think that healing energy and erotic energy are just different forms of the same thing.
He took women with metastatic breast cancer , randomly divided them into two groups.
Five years later , those women lived twice as long , and you can see that the people -- and that was the only difference between the groups.
The word yoga comes from the Sanskrit , meaning  " union , to yoke , to bring together. " 
To me , it’s just shorthand for what we’re talking about : that anything that creates a sense of connection and community and love is really healing.

Because that is the only way I ' m going to get my story across to you.
We ' re kind of like greedy kids , using it all up , aren ' t we ? 
When I was a kid , growing up in New York , I was smitten by snakes , the same way most kids are smitten by tops , marbles , cars , trains , cricket balls.
One of them was the remarkable gharial.
The king cobra is quite remarkable for several reasons.
A majority of them will die , of course . There is very high mortality in little baby reptiles who are just 10 to 12 inches long.
It really changed my life totally.
You can almost hear the drums throbbing back in that little cottage where we stay when we ' re there.
They are interested.
And it actually crawled into somebody ' s bathroom , and was hanging around there for two or three days.
But in order to find out the real secrets of these creatures [it was necessary] for us to actually insert a small radio transmitter inside [each] snake.
And it does it in such a way that it doesn ' t get bitten itself.
In this case a rather strange and inexplicable activity happened over the last breeding season , wherein a large male king cobra actually grabbed a female king cobra , didn ' t mate with it , actually killed it and swallowed it.
This male snake , 12 feet long , met another male king cobra.
Now , what are we doing with all this information ? 
And this is one of the ways we do it , by learning as much as we can about something so remarkable and so iconic in the rainforests there , in order to help protect trees , animals and of course the water sources.
And , just like Project Tiger , our activities with the king cobra is to look at a species of animal so that we protect its habitat and everything within it.
It pours out millions of gallons every hour , and supplies drinking water to at least 300 million people , and washes many , many babies , and of course feeds many , many animals , both domestic and wild , produces thousands of tons of rice.
And the thing is , it ' s not just big industry.
North central India , the Chambal River is where we have our base.
It has remarkable features.
In fact , if you see the map , the range of their original habitat was all the way from the Indus in Pakistan to the Irrawaddy in Burma.
And pretty soon we were seeing sights like this.
Their nests hatching along the riverside producing hundreds of hatchlings . It ' s just an amazing sight.
My pals in the Crocodile Specialist Group of the IUCN , the [Madras Crocodile Bank] , an NGO , the World Wildlife Fund , the Wildlife Institute of India , State Forest Departments , and the Ministry of Environment , we all work together on stuff.
Why ?  How could it happen ? 
So , in order to try to find out the answer to this , we got veterinarians from all over the world working with Indian vets to try to figure out what was happening.
And it ' s a horribly painful death.
So , it seemed that the toxin that was killing the gharial was something in the food chain , something in the fish they were eating.
The Chambal river is an absolutely incredible place.
But , again , heavy fishing pressures.
So , who is next ?  Us ? 
So , we ' re not sure where this story is going to end , whether it ' s got a happy or sad ending.
And the thing is , you know , the decision makers , the folks in power , they ' re up in their bungalows and so on in Delhi , in the city capitals . They are all supplied with plenty of water . It ' s cool.
We ' ve spent hundreds of millions of dollars on it , and nothing to show for it . Incredible.
So , we can do it.
And the final word is that there is a king cobra looking over our shoulders.
Namaste.
Do you have those conversations with people ? 
But I sort of -- there is an innocence in these animals.
CA : Now , incredible footage you showed of the viper being killed.
Usually they eat larger snakes like rat snakes , or even cobras.
And the guy who is working there with them , he ' s from Maharashtra , he said ,  " I think he ' s after the nusha. " 
http://www.ted.com/talks/ed_ulbrich_shows_how_benjamin_button_got_his_face.html
Ed Ulbrich : How Benjamin Button got his face
Hopefully it won ' t stutter.
Brad Pitt : What if I told you that I wasn ' t getting older ...
BP : I was born old.
BP : I heard momma and Tizzy whisper , and they said I was gonna die soon.
some you could see , some you couldn ' t.
Many of you , maybe you ' ve seen it or you ' ve heard of the story , but what you might not know is that for nearly the first hour of the film , the main character , Benjamin Button , who ' s played by Brad Pitt , is completely computer-generated from the neck up.
This is based on an F . Scott Fitzgerald short story.
But at the time we had to throw in the towel.
The project came back to us about a decade later , and this time with a director named David Fincher.
And David believed , like we do in the visual effects industry , that anything is possible as long as you have enough time , resources and , of course , money.
We went through a process of elimination and a process of discovery with David , and we ruled out , of course , swapping actors.
And makeup is an additive process . You have to build the face up.
Sounded great.
And they both believed this would make an amazing film , of course , but it was a very high-risk proposition.
And so , in 2004 , they commissioned us to do a screen test of Benjamin.
I ' ll roll that for you now . This was the first test for Benjamin Button.
And I can remember , actually , when I got the phone call to congratulate us , to say the movie was a go , I actually threw up.
And it ' s not a special effects film ; it has to be a man.
But we did know one thing.
You take the big problem and you break it down into smaller pieces and you start to attack that.
And we also needed to create a character that could hold up under , really , all conditions.
We did about 325 shots.
I ' m sure many of you have seen motion capture.
And then animators can take the data of the motion of those markers and apply them to a computer-generated character.
That ' s not terribly compelling.
We needed creases and dimples and wrinkles and all of those things.
So we were left with this idea that we ended up calling  " technology stew. " 
And the sauce was code in software that we ' d written to allow these disparate pieces of technology to come together and work as one.
He believed that there were 70 basic poses or shapes of the human face , and that those basic poses or shapes of the face can be combined to create infinite possibilities of everything the human face is capable of doing.
And here you can see a subject having phosphorus makeup stippled on her face.
And if you look in a comparison , on the left , we see what volumetric data gives us and on the right you see what markers give us.
And so , on the left , we were seeing 100,000 polygons.
This was the breakthrough.
From there , we actually carved up those faces into smaller pieces and components of his face.
We brought in Rick Baker , and Rick is one of the great makeup and special effects gurus of our industry.
So this is Ben 80.
So , in fact , anatomically , it is correct.
But we needed to get a database of him doing more than that.
Retargeting is the process of transposing that data onto another model.
So while all that ' s going on , we ' re down in New Orleans and locations around the world.
But now we needed to get Brad ' s performance to drive our virtual Benjamin.
He watched again and again.
From there we went into a process called image analysis.
And so we could choose , say , his left eyebrow.
On a frame-by-frame basis , we could actually reconstruct a 3D head that exactly matched the performance of Brad.
And then here ' s the reconstructed performance now with the timings of the performance.
We had to create a lighting system.
So the key here was to keep everybody looking in Ben ' s eyes.
We worked from dental molds of Brad.
We had one person devoted to the tongue for about nine months.
He ' s also in an old age home , he ' s in a nursing home around other old people , so he had to look exactly the same as the others.
There were no animators necessary to come in and interpret behavior or enhance his performance.
So it sees a smile as a smile.
Take another look.
But , that is Benjamin . Thank you.

Because the sloth bears in the wild were obviously getting depleted because of this.
And we went in , pretending to be buyers.
Sadly , the family of Qalandars depended on this bear.
So , we had to deal with it in a very practical and sustainable manner.
It was unacceptable.
And they use a red hot iron needle to make a hole through the muzzle.
We weren ' t sure at all . And we managed to convince him.
He has a telephone booth.
Then there was no looking back at all for us.
Education . The kids never went to school.
We were able to ensure brighter futures for these people.
We have a veterinary facility in our rescue centers.
The big news that I want to announce today is that next month we will be bringing in the very last bear of India , into our rescue center.
And the beautiful bears can of course live in the wild again.
Keith Bellows gleefully outlines the engineering marvels of the camel , a vital creature he calls  " the SUV of the desert. "  Though he couldn ' t bring a live camel to TED , he gets his camera crew as close as humanly possible to a one-ton beast in full rut.
[SHIT] This is arguably the back end of the design of animals.
And I ' d like you to imagine that that ' s a blackboard , and I just used some chalk on there.
And that ' s where the hyena comes in.
And what the missionaries would do is , they ' d walk around and they ' d pick up hyena shit.
When I started talking to Richard about what I was going to speak about , I had recently come back from Jordan , where I had an amazing experience with a camel.
There were four of us -- two Bedouin drivers -- and you can just imagine , this expanse is an ocean of sand , 105 degrees , one water bottle.
This went on about six or seven times , and we were getting more and more alarmed , and we were also getting deeper and deeper into the desert.
One water bottle -- remember , guys -- four people.
They went down like elevators ; we got on them . They went back up , and the Bedouin -- each Bedouin , four of them -- got behind each of the camels with a little whip.
About every 10 steps , they lean back and try to take a chunk out of your leg.
And I ' ve developed a very wonderful relationship with this creature by this point , and I ' ve realized that this is a mean son of a bitch.
And he kind of went ,  " Nah . I don ' t think we want to be bringing a camel. " 
I want you to inspect its mouth , look at its teeth.
So , I got a National Geographic film crew . We went down there , and I took one look at this camel.
So we got as close to it as possible , and I ' m going to share this -- Chris , if you want to roll this film -- and then I ' m going to show you a little bit more about the design of camels.
And you ' ll note I started chewing gum because I was around this camel all day.
Their nose -- you can see his nose is flared right now.
But not a big -- for instance , in zebras , they have a huge ear that ' s very mobile , so they can actually turn them both around.
So not only do they have the very long eyelashes , but there ' s the secondary -- I guess you ' d call it the [unclear] or whatever.
But -- now , I ' m not a chemist , but basically what happens is the fat is oxidized by their breathing.
They ' re like sun shoes , but , you know , with sand.
He will urinate and spin his tail to spread the urine around and make him more attractive.
Generally , they poop wherever they want to , but during their rut , they will defecate in perimeter areas.
We weigh our animals.
But I would put him closer to 2,000.
Don ' t even think about it . Don ' t think about it!
KB : What I didn ' t show you was -- you got that swinging thing going ? 
And that ' s how he really marks his territory.
But on this particular occasion , it was very , very clear that as horny as Suki was , Jasmine was having none of it.
But before I do , I just want to mention that this animal truly is a sort of the SUV of the sand , the ship of the desert . It ' s so vital to the inhabitants of the areas in which the camel is found -- largely Mongolia and Sahara -- that there are 160 words in Arabic to describe the camel.
Camel seeking camel.
I ' m TED Camel.
A distinguished nose , with nostrils lined to filter out sand and dust , and a groove that catches moisture.
Short fur that keeps my skin cool.
Here ' s a hint : Bactarian , Dromedary.
I usually won ' t sweat until my body reaches 105 degrees F -- enough to fry an egg.
I ' m powerful.
Jackie O . once said that traveling by camel made riding an elephant seem like taking a jet plane.
No surprise.
 " Camels are like angels, "  a Bedouin once said.
But this creature that you ' ve just seen ultimately adapts , and keeps adapting and adapting.
RW : That ' s terrific . Thank you.

And let me just tell you a little bit of how that came about.
When I was him back then , I was approached by J . Walter Thompson , the ad company , and they were hired sort of by the Sundance Channel.
And the poem , if it ' s written with the ear , already has been set to its own verbal music as it was composed.
I think more influential than Emily Dickinson or Coleridge or Wordsworth on my imagination were Warner Brothers , Merrie Melodies and Loony Tunes cartoons.
When I was Poet Laureate , there I go again -- I can ' t help it , it ' s true -- I created a poetry channel on Delta Airlines that lasted for a couple of years.
When you get a poem on a billboard or on the radio or on a cereal box or whatever , it happens to you so suddenly that you don ' t have time to deploy your anti-poetry deflector shields that were installed in high school.
My pen moves along the page like the snout of a strange animal shaped like a human arm and dressed in the sleeve of a loose green sweater.
Writing is not actually as easy as that for me.
A friend of mine has a slogan ; he ' s another poet.
And I think you could boil this poem down to saying ,  " Some days you eat the bear , other days the bear eats you. " 
All afternoon they face one another , the man in the brown suit , the woman in the blue dress -- perfectly motionless , perfectly behaved.
BC : There ' s a horror movie in there somewhere.
The name of the author is the first to go , followed obediently by the title , the plot , the heartbreaking conclusion , the entire novel , which suddenly becomes one you have never read , never even heard of.
Whatever it is you are struggling to remember , it is not poised on the tip of your tongue , not even lurking in some obscure corner of your spleen.
BC : The next poem is called  " The Country "  and it ' s based on , when I was in college I met a classmate who remains to be a friend of mine.
And when I would go up to the country , he would teach me things like deer hunting , which meant getting lost with a gun basically -- and trout fishing and stuff like that.
It ' s called  " The Country. " 
Who could sleep that night ? 
BC : Thank you.
So the little poem is called  " The Dead. " 
They watch the tops of our heads moving below on Earth.
But then again , it took us a long time to put the wheel and the suitcase together.
If it has a subject , the subject is adolescence.
Of course , you couldn ' t have done that all alone.
Of course , there will be time for all that later in your life , after you come out of your room and begin to blossom , or at least pick up all your socks.
But of course , that was in Austria at the height of Romantic lyricism , not here in the suburbs of Cleveland.
Thank you . Thank you.

So let ' s watch a movement happen , start to finish , in under three minutes and dissect some lessons from it.
Now , notice that the leader embraces him as an equal.
It takes guts to stand out like that.
So a movement must be public.
Now we ' ve got a movement.
So , over the next minute , you ' ll see all of those that prefer to stick with the crowd because eventually they would be ridiculed for not joining in.
Okay , but we might have missed the real lesson here.
If you really care about starting a movement , have the courage to follow and show others how to follow.
For a full year , A.J . Jacobs followed every piece of health advice he could -- from applying sunscreen by the shot glass to wearing a bicycle helmet while shopping . Onstage at TEDMED , he shares the surprising things he learned.
I ' ve spent the last decade subjecting myself to pain and humiliation , hopefully for a good cause , which is self-improvement.
And here ' s a little image of that.
My wife started to fine me one dollar for every irrelevant fact I inserted into conversation.
I ' m Jewish , but I ' m Jewish in the same way the Olive Garden is Italian.
And from the Ten Commandments to growing my beard -- because Leviticus says you cannot shave.
I got both of them.
So that ' s what I ' ve been doing the last couple of years.
It was so overwhelming , because the amount of things you have to do , it ' s just mind-boggling.
I wrote the book on a treadmill , and it took me about a thousand miles to write the book.
So I think half of my book advance went into sunscreen.
And my immunologist told me that I should also wipe down all of the remote controls and iPhones in my house , because those are just orgies of germs.
They started a public campaign that says ,  " A walking helmet is a good helmet. " 
Now it ' s a little extreme , I admit.
All of the markers went in the right direction.
But I also learned that I was too healthy , and that was unhealthy.
And I kind of went overboard on the week after the project was over.
Because I have three young kids , so that wasn ' t happening.
It was really a life-changing project.
Because we live in such a noisy world.
And this , over the years , can cause real damage , cardiovascular damage.
So they think it ' s actually very deadly.
When they wrote the Constitution , they put dirt all over the cobblestones outside the hall so that they could concentrate.
And just to give you one instance of this : food.
So I basically have tried to incorporate crunchiness into a lot of my recipes -- throw in some sunflower seeds.
The book about it comes out in April.
So thank you very much.

Civilization as we know it has ceased to exist -- no books , no electronic devices , no Facebook or Twitter.
Well perhaps some rectangular pieces of plastic with strange symbols on them.
Now let ' s ask ourselves , what could such artifacts say about us to people 4,000 years into the future ? 
It occupied the area of approximately one million square kilometers , covering what is now Pakistan , Northwestern India and parts of Afghanistan and Iran.
Here ' s an example of one of these objects.
A priest ? 
Now we don ' t know if it says Hollywood , or even Bollywood for that matter.
So you see up there one such object.
Perhaps that big ? 
It ' s only about one inch by one inch in size -- pretty tiny.
These were used to make those kinds of packing slips.
Deciphering the script is not just an intellectual puzzle ; it ' s actually become a question that ' s become deeply intertwined with the politics and the cultural history of South Asia.
There ' s a second group of people who believe that the Indus script represents an Indo-European language.
These people believe that the Indus script represents an ancient form of the Dravidian language family , which is the language family spoken in much of South India today.
But deciphering the script is a very challenging task.
And furthermore , we don ' t even know what language they spoke.
In the rest of my talk , I ' d like to tell you about how I learned to stop worrying and love the challenge posed by the Indus script.
My career path led me to become a computational neuroscientist , so in my day job , I create computer models of the brain to try to understand how the brain makes predictions , how the brain makes decisions , how the brain learns and so on.
And I ' d like to describe some of the results that we have found.
Here are two texts that contain some symbols on them.
Okay . Left to right ? 
One of the signs is also below the text on the top.
Languages contain patterns.
Now there ' s several thoughts . There ' s E . It could be I . It could be A , but certainly not B , C or D , right ? 
And this is very similar to a Q and U example.
The idea was to use a computer to learn these patterns , and so we gave the computer the existing texts.
Here are some examples.
There ' s also practical use for this particular procedure.
Here ' s an example of a symbol that was predicted.
I think you might get a random jumble of letters that looks like this.
How many of you have ever spilled coffee on a keyboard ? 
What about the Indus script ? 
At the lower end of the scale , you find a rigid sequence , a sequence of all A ' s , and you also find a computer program , in this case in the language Fortran , which obeys really strict rules.
When this result was first published , it was highly controversial.
Who ' d have thought that deciphering could be a dangerous profession ? 
What other evidence is there that the script could actually encode language ? 
Some things are not right , and you ' ll say these words are probably not English words.
This sign is the most frequently-occurring sign in the Indus script , and it ' s only in this text that it occurs as a doubling pair.
And why were they found there ? 
It ' s just like our English and Dutch example.
If it does represent language , then how do we read the symbols ? 
So as an example , here ' s a word.
Okay . Great.
In the case of the Indus script , the problem is the reverse.
And I ' d like to give you a quick example of Parpola ' s work.
And it turns out that in India there ' s a long tradition of names being based on horoscopes and star constellations present at the time of birth.
And finally , there ' s other combinations , such as this fish sign with something that looks like a roof on top of it.
But does this prove that these seals contain Dravidian names based on planets and star constellations ? 
The decipherment of these two scripts enabled these civilizations to speak to us again directly.
These are our ancestors -- yours and mine.
What would we find out about them ?  About us ? 
Buddhism,God,culture,global issues,happiness,peace,religion
I feel it ' s sort of like the Vimalakirti Sutra , an ancient work from ancient India in which the Buddha appears at the beginning and a whole bunch of people come to see him from the biggest city in the area , Vaishali , and they bring some sort of jeweled parasols to make an offering to him.
What ' s he doing over there at Amrapali ' s house with all his 500 monks, "  and so on . They were all grumbling , and so they boycotted him.
And as soon as they had laid all these , all their big stack of these jeweled parasols that they used to carry in ancient India , he performed a kind of special effect which made it into a giant planetarium , the wonder of the universe . Everyone looked in that , and they saw in there the total interconnectedness of all life in all universes.
He made that special effect at the beginning to get everyone to think about interconnection and interconnectedness and how everything in life was totally interconnected.
I guess so . Because in a way , if a TEDster relates to all the interconnectedness of all the computers and everything , it ' s the forging of a mass awareness , of where everybody can really know everything that ' s going on everywhere in the planet.
And of course , we all will be deeply disappointed when we do.
And occasionally we get together with another person stuck in their skin and the two of us enjoy each other , and each one tries to get out of their own , and ultimately it fails of course , and then we ' re back into this thing.
You know , someone sitting next to you in a seat -- that ' s OK because you ' re in a theater , but if you were sitting on a park bench and someone came up and sat that close to you , you ' d freak out.
Who is it who ' s going to get enough attention from the world ? 
You can experience yourself as the other beings when you see through the delusion of being separated from them.
My bones are aching . I go from birth to death . I ' m never satisfied.
It would be terrible.
Too bad nobody ever woke up to it , and they ' ve been trying to suppress it since then.
It ' s totally strange.
The good time is over when you think , how good is it ? 
He once told me -- he looked kind of sad ; he worries very much about the haves and have-nots.
They didn ' t help at all.
But of course , what you said , I think the key to saving the world , the key to compassion is that it is more fun.
He feels the way they are harvesting yaks nowadays.
You have to find some vision where you see how hopeful it is , how it can be changed.
So , compassion means to feel the feelings of others , and the human being actually is compassion.
But he could memorize all the needs of all the beings that he is , he will , he did.
So then you decide ,  " Well , I ' m sick of myself.
And you realize that this -- being with these people -- is the flower garden that Chiho showed us.
Artist-technologist Honor Harger listens to the weird and wonderful noises of stars and planets and pulsars . In her work , she tracks the radio waves emitted by ancient celestial objects and turns them into sound , including  " the oldest song you will ever hear, "  the sound of cosmic rays left over from the Big Bang.
Space , we all know what it looks like.
But the story of how we came to understand the universe is just as much a story of listening as it is by looking.
This is the planet Jupiter.
And you may wonder , how do we know what these sounds are ? 
And just like the signals that we send and receive here on Earth , we can convert these transmissions into sound using simple analog techniques.
Now this story doesn ' t start with vast telescopes or futuristic spacecraft , but a rather more humble technology -- and in fact , the very medium which gave us the telecommunications revolution that we ' re all part of today : the telephone.
But like any long length of charged wire , it also inadvertently became an antenna.
We didn ' t have the technology to transmit.
Using the very first telephone , Watson was in fact dialed into the heavens.
He had accidentally been the first person to tune in to them.
Radio could carry sound without wires.
They turned out to be lightning or sources of electrical power.
Fifty years on from Watson ' s accidental encounter with the Sun , Jansky ' s careful listening ushered in a new age of space exploration : the radio astronomy age.
And once again , two scientists have got a problem with noise.
A mysterious persistent noise was disrupting their research.
And so perhaps once they cleaned up the pigeon droppings , get the disk kind of operational again , normal operations would resume.
This was the first experimental evidence that the Big Bang existed and the universe was born at a precise moment some 14.7 billion years ago.

Robert Full on animal movement
The translation of that is , could you help me build a foot ? 
So please send me your ideas about how to design a foot.
But if you wanted to really do research , what do you have to do ? 
The problem is , there are many , many feet.
As you see this clip , look for principles , and also think about experiments that you might design in order to understand how a foot works.
Wow.
They can locomote on substrates that vary as you saw -- in the probability of contact , the movement of that surface and the type of footholds that are present.
It ' s still running at the human equivalent of 300 miles per hour.
And in fact , the animal contacts other parts of its leg more frequently than the traditionally defined foot.
Without a foot , here ' s what it does . It doesn ' t even slow down.
Look carefully : this is slowed down 100 times , and watch what it ' s doing with the rest of its leg.
Journalists , this is off the record ; it ' s embargoed.
We ' ve also described another species of bipedal octopus.
It uses that beautiful distributed foot to make it as if those obstacles are not even there -- truly extraordinary.
It ' s the ultimate distributed foot : its whole body in this case is acting like its foot.
We biologically inspired this robot , named RHex , built by these extraordinary engineers over the last few years.
What you ' ll see , in fact , is that it ' s using that half circle leg as a distributed foot.
Really simple , but beautiful.
When you touched the cockroach leg , what did it feel like ? 
Maybe we could give it to our curator and see if he ' d be brave enough to touch the cockroach.
We found that they ' re for something else -- here ' s a segment of that spine.
The crabs are missing spines , so they have a problem in this kind of rough terrain.
Do we really understand that principle of tuning ?  The answer is , yes!
Now will this help us think about the design of more effective climbing robots ? 
How does it do it ? 
And watch again , right there -- successful.
One of the ones I ' m passing around is climbing up this vertical surface that ' s a smooth metal plate.
We can actually model that behavior better as a fluid , if you look at it.
It ' s actually functioning as a paddle even though it ' s interacting with a surface that we normally think of as a solid.
So here ' s RHex with paddles , now converted into an incredibly maneuverable swimming robot.
CA : I did.
So to our blueprint , let ' s attach claws.
Let ' s look at that ant.
You see what happens ? 
And this was a hard shot to get -- I think this is the shot of the ant foot on the superstrings.
It certainly helps it to hold on.
The gecko ' s a really great example of nanotechnology in nature.
If we slow it down , they attach their feet at eight milliseconds , and detach them in 16 milliseconds.
If you look at their feet , they have leaf-like structures called linalae with millions of hairs.
And they don ' t stick by glue , or they don ' t work like Velcro , or they don ' t work with suction.
And here ' s the simplest version in nature , and here ' s my collaborator Ron Fearing ' s attempt at an artificial version of this dry adhesive made from polyurethane.
Lots of people have , and we ' re excited about realizing this as a product.
But it makes an incredible Band-Aid.
Here you are , pulling off the Band-Aid.
I call the new robot RiSE , for  " Robot in Scansorial Environment "  -- that ' s a climbing environment -- and we have an extraordinary team of biologists and engineers creating this robot.
You have the audio ?  You can hear it go up.
Mark Cutkosky , though , is taking it a step further.
And that ' s exactly what he ' s done.
So this is not using any suction , any glue , and it will ultimately , when it ' s attached to the robot -- it ' s as biologically inspired as the animal -- hopefully be able to climb any kind of a surface.
These tuned structures allow the spines , friction pads and ultimately the adhesive hairs to grab onto very challenging , difficult surfaces.
To finish : we ' ve gotten design secrets from nature by looking at how feet are built.
And third , we believe strongly that we do not want to mimic nature but instead be inspired by biology , and use these novel principles with the best engineering solutions that are out there to make -- potentially -- something better than nature.
We ' re at a unique moment in history , says UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown : we can use today ' s interconnectedness to develop our shared global ethic -- and work together to confront the challenges of poverty , security , climate change and the economy.
Can I say how delighted I am to be away from the calm of Westminster and Whitehall ? 
A man before a tank became a picture that became a symbol for the whole world of resistance.
What they have in common is what we see unlocks what we cannot see.
What these pictures demonstrate is that there is a moral sense across all religions , across all faiths , across all continents -- a moral sense that not only do we share the pain of others , and believe in something bigger than ourselves but we have a duty to act when we see things that are wrong that need righted , see injuries that need to be corrected , see problems that need to be rectified.
And Ronald Reagan said ,  " I don’t care what kind of communist he is! " 
I believe there is a moral sense and a global ethic that commands attention from people of every religion and every faith , and people of no faith.
They protested across Britain.
Or if you take Eglantyne Jebb , the woman who created Save the Children 90 years ago.
In Philippines in 2001 , President Estrada -- a million people texted each other about the corruption of that regime , eventually brought it down and it was , of course , called the  " coup de text. " 
Then take Iran itself , and what people are doing today : following what happened to Neda , people who are preventing the security services of Iran finding those people who are blogging out of Iran , any by everybody who is blogging , changing their address to Tehran , Iran , and making it difficult for the security services.
200 years ago the problem we had to solve was slavery.
In the last 50-60 years we have seen fascism , anti-Semitism , racism , apartheid , discrimination on the basis of sex and gender and sexuality ; all these have come under pressure because of the campaigns that have been run by people to change the world.
And Nelson Mandela was quite surprised at the appearance of the singer and I was explaining to him at the time who she was.
He said in his lifetime he had climbed a great mountain , the mountain of challenging and then defeating racial oppression and defeating apartheid.
Climate change cannot be solved in one country , but has got to be solved by the world working together.
So the great project of our generation , it seems to me , is to build for the first time , out of a global ethic and our global ability to communicate and organize together , a truly global society , built on that ethic but with institutions that can serve that global society and make for a different future.
One of the reasons why an institution is not in itself enough is that we have got to persuade people around the world to change their behavior as well , so you need that global ethic of fairness and responsibility across the generations.
You need in the long run for stability , for economic growth , for jobs , as well as for financial stability , global economic institutions that make sure that growth to be sustained has to be shared , and are built on the principle that the prosperity of this world is indivisible.
I have just been talking to the President of Sierra Leone.
She was 11 years old ; her parents had both died from AIDS , her mother and then her father.
When you looked in her eyes , any girl at the age of eleven is looking forward to the future , but there was an unreachable sadness in that girl’s eyes and if I could have translated that to the rest of the world for that moment , I believe that all the work that it had done for the global HIV/AIDS fund would be rewarded by people being prepared to make donations.
In the Rwanda Children ' s Museum , there is a photograph of a 10-year-old boy and the Children ' s Museum is commemorating the lives that were lost in the Rwandan genocide where a million people died.
David : ambition to be a doctor.
Tortured to death.
So we have got to create in this world also institutions for peacekeeping and humanitarian aid , but also for reconstruction and security for some of the conflict-ridden states of the world.
That global ethic can infuse the fairness and responsibility that is necessary for these institutions to work , but we should not lose the chance in this generation , in this decade in particular , with President Obama in America , with other people working with us around the world , to create global institutions for the environment , and for finance , and for security and for development , that make sense of our responsibility to other peoples , our desire to bind the world together , and our need to tackle problems that everybody knows exist.
We should be marching towards a global society.

It ' s called the WorldWide Telescope , and I want to thank TED and Microsoft for allowing me to bring it to your attention.
If we were having this TED meeting in our grandparents '  day , that might not be so big a claim.
Of course , we know today that galaxies extend far beyond our own galaxy.
We see alien worlds , we see alien solar systems -- 300 now , and still counting -- and they ' re not like us.
First , it enables you to experience the universe : the WorldWide Telescope , for me , is a kind of magic carpet that lets you navigate through the universe where you want to go.
And in telling stories , each of us is going to understand the universe in our own way.
they often say ,  " Oh , tiny . I feel tiny and insignificant. " 
I can ' t tell you what a privilege it is to introduce Curtis Wong from Microsoft.
And the tours are all totally interactive , so that if I were to go somewhere ...
It ' s a labor of love for us and our small team , and we really hope it will inspire kids to explore and learn about the universe.
And so , what you ' ve seen today is less than a fraction of one percent of what is in here , and in the TED Lab , we have a tour that was created by a six-year-old named Benjamin that will knock your socks off.

Since we are such a visual species , it ' s hard for us to really understand this , so I ' ll use a mixture of figures and sounds and hope this can communicate it.
And what marine mammals have evolved over the last tens of millions of years is ways to depend on sound to both explore their world and also to stay in touch with one another.
All marine mammals use sound for communication to stay in touch.
And I mentioned I ' ll use some visual representations of sounds.
It sounds sort of like  " tweeeeeet. "  Like that.
It ' s really important for our music and our language.
Many mammals have to produce contact calls when , say , a mother and calf are apart.
They can use this ability to learn calls in order to develop more complicated and more distinctive calls to identify individuals.
What this figure shows is the percentage of the separations in which dolphins whistle , against the maximum distance.
Most of these distinctive signature whistles are quite stereotyped and stable through the life of a dolphin.
This plot shows two members of a pair.
And what ' s happened is they ' ve used this learning process to develop a new sign that identifies this new social group.
This is a bad situation.
And if we look at a very pristine environment like western Australia , Lars Bider has done work comparing dolphin behavior and distribution before there were dolphin-watching boats.
So it could have a negative impact on the whole population.
So you can draw a line to try to protect an area , but chemical pollution and noise pollution will continue to move through the area.
But I ' d also like to point out that the oceans are much more connected than we think.
So we live in a world of satellite communication , are used to global communication , but it ' s still amazing to me.
In the early  ' 70s , Roger Payne and an ocean acoustician published a theoretical paper pointing out that it was possible that sound could transmit over these large areas , but very few biologists believed it.
They form songs , and they appear to play a role in reproduction , sort of like that of song birds.
It had deep underwater microphones , or hydrophones , cabled to shore , all wired back to a central place that could listen to sounds over the whole North Atlantic.
This shows us both that the calls are detectable over hundreds of miles and that whales routinely swim hundreds of miles.
Humpbacks , when they develop the ability to sing this song , they ' re listening to other whales and modifying what they sing based on what they ' re hearing , just like song birds or the dolphin whistles I described.
And this orange line here marks the typical songs of east coast humpbacks.
They just sang the cool new west coast song.
Now you are listening to a recording made by Chris Clark , 0.2 miles away from a humpback.
That ' s shown down here.
Here ' s a blue whale call at 50 miles , which was distant for the humpback.
But you can still hear that faint call.
Imagine that whale listening from 500 miles.
And on the y-axis is the loudness of average ambient noise in the deep ocean by frequency.
Now think about it . This is an amazing thing : That in this frequency range where whales communicate , the main source globally , on our planet , for the noise comes from human ships , thousands of human ships , distant , far away , just all aggregating.
Now in the pre-industrial ocean , as we were mentioning , this whale call could be easily detected.
Now if this signal is used for males and females to find each other for mating and they ' re dispersed , imagine the impact this could have on the recovery of endangered populations.
Now imagine -- let ' s put the ship noise in the picture.
Susan Parks of Penn State has actually studied this.
Same thing in the North Atlantic , in the  ' 50s versus 2000.
And we now know that whales can compensate for noise by calling louder , like I did when that ship was playing , by waiting for silence and by shifting their call out of the noise band.
It ' s a really important problem.
If you actually insulate and isolate the machinery of the ship from the hull , you can reduce that noise by 99 percent.
This is a whale that just squeaked by a rapidly moving container ship and avoided collision.
The first case comes from the Bay of Fundy.
Well , biologists who couldn ' t take no for an answer went to the International Maritime Organization and petitioned them to say ,  " Can ' t you move that lane ?  Those are just lines on the ground.
And as you can see , the risk of collision is much lower.
The Maersk Line looked at their competition and saw that everybody who is in shipping thinks time is money.
They could slow down by about 50 percent.
They ' ve evolved over tens of millions of years to take advantage of this.

Philip Zimbardo : The demise of guys ? 
So what ' s the data ? 
Girls outperform boys now at every level , from elementary school to graduate school.
What ' s the evidence of wiping out ? 
And we ' re seeing a steady increase among males.
It ' s a social awkwardness like you ' re a stranger in a foreign land.
It turns out , from earliest childhood , boys , and then men , prefer the company of guys -- physical company.
What are the causes ?  Well , it ' s an unintended consequence.
Arousal addiction , you want different.
Jane McGonigal told us last year that by the time a boy is 21 , he ' s played 10,000 hours of video games , most of that in isolation.
And the porn industry is the fastest growing industry in America -- 15 billion annually.
That means they ' re totally out of sync in traditional classes , which are analog , static , interactively passive.
But who should care ?  The only people who should care about this is parents of boys and girls , educators , gamers , filmmakers and women who would like a real man who they can talk to , who can dance , who can make love slowly and contribute to the evolutionary pressures to keep our species above banana slugs.

This thing allows you to have multiple points at the same time.
I mean , people like Bill Buxton have been playing around with it in the  ' 80s.
So , for instance , we have a lava lamp application here . Now , you can see , I can use both of my hands to kind of squeeze together and put the blobs together . I can inject heat into the system here , or I can pull it apart with two of my fingers.
Now what ' s great about a multi-touch sensor is that , you know , I could be doing this with as many fingers here , but of course multi-touch also inherently means multi-user.
This is a photographer ' s light box application.
I can do that grossly with both of my hands , or I can do it just with two fingers on each of my hands together.
There ' s no manual . This is exactly what you expect , especially if you haven ' t interacted with a computer before.
And I can bring that around , put that up there.
We have so much technology nowadays that these interfaces should start conforming to us.
So -- again , isn ' t this great ? 
It ' ll remember the strokes I ' m making . Of course I can do it with all my hands.
Now this is going to be really important as we start getting to things like data visualization . For instance , I think we all really enjoyed Hans Rosling ' s talk , and he really emphasized the fact that I ' ve been thinking about for a long time too : we have all this great data , but for some reason , it ' s just sitting there.
But as you can see , I can use the same two-fingered gestures to go down and go in really seamlessly . There ' s no interface , again.
Now , the great thing about mapping applications -- it ' s not really 2D , it ' s kind of 3D . So , again , with a multi-point interface , you can do a gesture like this -- so you can be able to tilt around like that , you know . It ' s not just simply relegated to a kind of 2D panning and motion.
And so the last thing I want to show you is -- you know , I ' m sure we can all think of a lot of entertainment apps that you can do with this thing.
But the neat thing about it is I can add control points.
I mean , this technique of being able to manipulate a mesh here , with multiple control points , is actually something that ' s state of the art.
This kind of technology is going to let even more people get into it , and I ' m really looking forward to interacting with all you guys over the next few days and seeing how it can apply to your respective fields.

I grew up in a traditional Mexican family.
Firstly , because I ' m the one who ' s going to say it.
I ' m going to talk about the role we members of society play in this phenomenon , and about four different response levels we citizens have against violence.
I think we have a problem in Mexico.
What we don ' t agree on is what the problem actually is.
I don ' t mean they don ' t deserve attention.
Historically , we ' ve always acted as victims of something or somebody.
Then we were victims of the PRI.
Hold on! Wait a minute!
We need to open our eyes and see that we are not victims.
The first level , the weakest level of civil response against violence , is denial and apathy.
It ' s like someone who has a serious illness and pretends it ' s the flu and it will just go away.
And if we don ' t do something about it , the cancer will end up killing it.
Many people in Mexico are afraid today.
Let ' s think about Mexican streets : they ' re unsafe because of violence , so people stay at home.
This vicious circle ends up with the whole population stuck inside their houses , scared to death -- even more afraid than when we were out on the streets.
For many people , acting involves rage.
Recently -- this is a sensitive figure -- 35 public lynchings have been recorded so far in 2010 in Mexico.
Unfortunately , violent action -- though action is better than no action -- but taking part in it only disguises violence.
It means it ' s determined and effective , but not violent.
In the end , Benjamín and Julián decided the best thing they could do was to organize the community and act together.
We ' ll be waiting for you right here. " 
Of course , criminals can respond.
And for over a year he has known that a price has been put on his head.
These heroic acts are present all over the country.
I was born in Mexico , I grew up in Mexico and along the way , I learned to love Mexico.
That devotion we show in helping victims of disasters , such as the earthquake in 1985 or this year ' s floods.
A mother is the most sacred thing in life.
What are we going to do ? 
Today in Mexico we ' re asking for Gandhis.
This is a call so that every single thing we love about Mexico -- the festivals , the markets , the restaurants , the cantinas , the tequila , the mariachis , the serenades , the posadas , El Grito , the Day of the Dead , San Miguel , the joy , the passion for life , the fight and everything it means to be Mexican -- doesn ' t disappear from this world.
Anyone can kill me , or you , or you.
He said ,  " Count it the greatest sin to prefer life to honor , and for the sake of living to lose what makes life worth living. " 
MacArthur grant,dance,entertainment,math,music,physics,sports
And as a golfer and as a kid , one of the things that really sort of seeped into my pores , that I sort of lived my whole life , is process.
Well , I learned a lot about interesting things that I knew nothing about at the time , but grew to know stuff about.
But Tod couldn ' t come and the project is sort of somewhere , I ' m not sure whether it ' s happening the way we thought , or not.
And you can turn the mike on now . I ' m going to do a couple of pieces.
You see , I think Richard said something about people that are against something.
So juggling gravity -- up , down.
Thanks . So , visual music : rhythm and complexity.
We ' re jugglers , OK . And remember , you ' re transposing , you ' re getting into a subculture here.
You can change the rhythm , if you get out of the lights.
So , you ' ve got to go after the space down there.
It ' s learning skills -- like being in a high-speed car crash.
So , complexity . Now , how many here are jugglers ? 
Well , that ' s what juggling is about , right ? 
And you could play with the rhythm.
Make it narrower.
I have no idea how computer-oriented or three-dimensionally-oriented you are , but let ' s try something.
Now , do me a favor : follow the ball that I ask you to follow.
White.
You want to do it ?  Yeah ?  OK.
Index finger , middle finger , ring , little.
All right . A lot of different learning processes going on in here.
Shake your hands out.
So what I want you to do is -- fingers.
So , we ' re going to start off looking at the white ball -- and I ' m going to tell you which color , and I ' m also going to tell you to go with your fingers . OK ? 
Finger , finger , finger , pink or finger.
It ' s a moment that you can ' t make sense of.
You know , what are you supposed to do ? 
I ' m going to change the script for one second . Just let me do this.
Now , I ' m going to start showing you some original techniques that come from the work that I ' ve developed . OK ? 
All right , I ' m going to get on my knees and do it.
Another moment.
And what do you dedicate it to , in exploring a particular thing ? 
And then it comes to rest . Just a little thing about time.
Are we ready to do that ?  Yes ? 
The only other thing is , it was a real shock.
Balance : making up the rules so you can ' t cheat , so you learn to approach stillness with different parts of your body.
The rhythm can get much smaller.
Thanks . That has a certain kind of balance to it , which is all about plumb.
Which is again exploring space , or the lines in space.
This is a little thing that I made because I really like the idea of curves and balls together.
This is exploring geometry and the rhythm of shape.
The next piece that I ' m going to do -- which is the cylinders piece , if you want to get that up -- it has to do with cylinder seals from about 5,000 years ago , which were stones with designs that were used to roll over wet clay with all sorts of great designs . I love ceramics and all of that.
Talking about geometry and everything , if you take the circle and you split it in half -- can you run  " S-Curve music ?  " 
They ' re not ideas , they ' re instincts.
And what it is , is working with both positive and negative space but also with these curves.
Because my attempt is to make visual instruments , not to just make -- I ' ll try one other thing.
But I really like it , it feels right.
And to change , and to change.
IDEO’s David Kelley says that product design has become much less about the hardware and more about the user experience . He shows video of this new , broader approach , including footage from the Prada store in New York.
There ' s a lot of exciting things happening in the design world and at IDEO this past year , and I ' m pleased to get a chance to share some of those with you.
And so it was great fun in those days , and some of those of you who are in the audience were my clients.
And if you were here last year , I probably wrestled you to the floor and tried to show you my new EyeModule 2 , which was a camera that plugged into the Handspring.
Maybe you ' ve seen them in the airports ?  They seem to be everywhere now.
But something ' s happened in the last 18 years since Richard started TED , and that ' s that people like us -- I know people in other places have caught onto this for a long time , but for us , we ' ve really just started .. . we ' ve kind of climbed Maslow ' s hierarchy a little bit -- and so we ' re now focused more and more on human-centered design , human-centeredness in an approach to design.
Then we ' d go and we ' d show those as communicating our ideas.
It ' s kind of like architects who show people in their houses , as opposed to them being empty.
He wanted a new kind of store -- a new one -- a store that had a cultural role as well as a retail one.
You can look at color , and sizes , and how it appeared on the runway , or whatever.
The last time I went to see this store , there was a huge buzz about people standing outside and wondering ,  " Am I going to actually get to see the people changing clothes here ?  " 
There ' s a big display in the mirror , and you can turn around -- but there ' s a three second delay.
I don ' t know if anybody ' s seen this -- it ' s pretty spectacular in the room.
And then when you get to a station , it ' s expanded so that you can actually read it.
And also , it ' s not shown in the video , but these are very beautiful.
Scott Adams ran into us and asked us if we wouldn ' t help to design the ultimate cubicle for Dilbert , which sounded like a fun thing and so we couldn ' t pass it up.
Narrator : Though they work in a wide-open office space spectacularly set under San Francisco ' s Oakland Bay Bridge , the team built their own little cubicles to fully experience the problems.
SA : So far it ' s chaos , but a lot of people are doing stuff , so that ' s good.
Behind the humor is the idea of making the cubicle more human. )  David Kelley : So here ' s the final thing , complete with orange lighting that follows the sun across -- that follows the tracks of the sun -- across the sky.
DK : And of course : a hammock for your afternoon nap that stretches across your cubicle.
The pavilion ' s design goal was to be kind of quiet and peaceful.
And then , if you saw , the panels actually rotate . So you can get the information on the front side , but as they rotate , you can see the actual recycling plant behind , with all the machines as they actually process the water.
It ' s called Spyfish , and it ' s a company called H2Eye , started by Nigel Jagger in London.
For us -- there ' s the object -- for us , it was two projects . One , to design the interface so that the interface doesn ' t get in your way.
 ( Narrator : The Spyfish is a revolutionary subaquatic video camera.
 ( Narrator : And this central box connects the whole system together.
ApproTEC is a company started by Dr . Martin Fisher , who ' s a good friend of mine . He ' s a Ph.D . from Stanford.
And to this date -- he ' s been gone for only a few years -- he ' s started 19,000 companies.
So we ' re in the process of helping them design deep-well , low-cost manual pumps in order for these people who have a quarter acre of land to be able to grow crops in the off-season.
We also were thinking about the experience of Richard , and so -- -- we designed this hat , because I knew I ' d be the last one in the day and I needed to deal with him . So I just have one more thing to say.
So we saw a lot of interesting things being designed today in this session , and from all the different presenters.
Nature ' s mysteries meet tack-sharp wit in this hilarious , 10-minute mix of quips and fun lessons , as comedian , writer and TV man John Lloyd plucks at the substance of several things not seen.
So the question is , what is invisible ? 
As in this cryptic sentence I found in The Guardian recently :  " The marriage suffered a setback in 1965 , when the husband was killed by the wife. " 
We can ' t see into the engine room.
Electrons disappear in a kind of fuzz , and there is only energy . And you can ' t see energy.
It ' s about an M.P . called Geoffrey Dickens.
A few days later he received a letter from a constituent saying how much she admired him , had met him at a fete and asking for a signed photograph.
A photo is not enough. " 
I wrote Horse Face on her , so you ' d remember who she was. " 
It ' s the least understood of all the four fundamental forces , and the weakest.
So , bright guy , could be wrong on that one , I don ' t know.
But we can touch each other , taste each other perhaps , if we get close enough.
So that ' s why we don ' t think it exists , the Sufi masters working on us.
Remind you of anyone ? 
I refuse to be drawn on the question of whether God exists , until somebody properly defines the terms.
We now think there are likely to be only just over 20,000 genes in the human genome.
You can ' t see these things , but they are very strange.
Time , nobody can see time.
And you can ' t see the past , except in your memory.
Because that ' s where all the stuff happens that makes you who you are.
But every cell in your body is replaced at some point.
The question is , who , then , are we ? 
Gas , you can ' t see that.
Quite good . He also invented a word called  " blas, "  meaning astral radiation.
You can ' t see light . When it ' s dark , in a vacuum , if a person shines a beam of light straight across your eyes , you won ' t see it . Slightly technical , some physicists will disagree with this.
Don ' t let anyone tell you they understand electricity.
Galaxies , 100 billion of them estimated in the universe.
Heinrich Hertz , when he discovered radio waves in 1887 , he called them radio waves because they radiated.
But I guess somebody will find a use for them someday. " 
Thomas Edison once said ,  " We don ' t know one percent of one millionth about anything. " 
But the point , what I ' ve got it down to , is there are only two questions really worth asking.
But I ' m pretty sure it ' s not in order to enjoy ourselves. " 
http://www.ted.com/talks/what_we_learned_from_5_million_books.html
What we learned from 5 million books
And we cogitated about this for about four years.
Jean-Baptiste Michel : So how did we get to this conclusion ? 
Now of course , if there ' s a scale for how awesome that is , that has to rank extremely , extremely high.
This is extremely practical , but not so awesome.
So what that means is , one could use computational methods to read all of the books in a click of a button.
These authors have been striving to write books.
Now when Google digitizes a book , they put it into a really nice format.
What we ' re left with is a collection of five million books , 500 billion words , a string of characters a thousand times longer than the human genome -- a text which , when written out , would stretch from here to the Moon and back 10 times over -- a veritable shard of our cultural genome.
We ' re going to try science. " 
Now Google , and Jon Orwant in particular , told us a little equation that we should learn.
We said , well instead of releasing the full text , we ' re going to release statistics about the books.
That gives us a time series of how frequently this particular sentence was used over time.
Well the individual n-grams measure cultural trends.
Well which one should I use ? 
And he ' d tell you ,  " Well most people say thrived , but some people say throve. " 
Two rows from this table of two billion entries.
JM : Now there are many other pictures that are worth 500 billion words.
JM : You might also want to have a look at this particular n-gram , and that ' s to tell Nietzsche that God is not dead , although you might agree that he might need a better publicist.
In 1700 , in 1800 , in 1900 , no one cared.
But nothing got people interested in 1950 like the year 1950.
Finally in 1954 , someone woke up and realized that 1950 had gotten somewhat passé.
We can say ,  " Well how fast does the bubble burst ?  " 
JM : Now a little piece of career advice.
But if you want to reach the very top , you should delay gratification and , of course , become a politician.
One mistake you should not do is become a mathematician.
For instance , here ' s the trajectory of Marc Chagall , an artist born in 1887.
And of course , what we ' re seeing is the fact Marc Chagall was a Jewish artist in Nazi Germany.
Well , a reasonable expectation is that somebody ' s fame in a given period of time should be roughly the average of their fame before and their fame after.
If the suppression index is very , very , very small , then you very well might be being suppressed.
What you expect is basically what you observe.
There are many people who end up on the far left on this distribution who are talked about 10 times fewer than they should have been.
It ' s kind of like genomics.
Here , instead of through the lens of a genome , through the lens of digitized pieces of the historical record.
We have to make this available for people. " 
So people want to be their best , put their best foot forward.
It ' s not that strove for mediocrity , it ' s just that the S used to be written differently , kind of like an F.
Actually , we ' re not going to have to talk , we ' re just going to show you all the slides and remain silent.
If the planet Earth is annihilated by the Vogons to make room for an interstellar bypass , that ' s an eight A  " aaaaaaaargh. " 
JM : There are many usages of this data , but the bottom line is that the historical record is being digitized.
There ' s much more in culture : there ' s manuscripts , there newspapers , there ' s things that are not text , like art and paintings.
In our louder and louder world , says sound expert Julian Treasure ,  " We are losing our listening. "  In this short , fascinating talk , Treasure shares five ways to re-tune your ears for conscious listening -- to other people and the world around you.
We are losing our listening.
Let ' s define listening as making meaning from sound.
So in a cocktail party like this , if I say ,  " David , Sara , pay attention, "  some of you just sat up.
We listen to differences , we discount sounds that remain the same.
But they actually create our reality in a way , because they tell us what we ' re paying attention to right now.
But it ' s a great intention to have in a relationship.
And you ' re aware of how many people are around you because of the micro-noises you ' re receiving.
I said at the beginning , we ' re losing our listening.
The premium on accurate and careful listening has simply disappeared.
We ' re becoming impatient.
We ' re becoming desensitized.
This is not trivial.
So I ' d like to share with you five simple exercises , tools you can take away with you , to improve your own conscious listening.
Just three minutes a day of silence is a wonderful exercise to reset your ears and to recalibrate so that you can hear the quiet again.
How many individual channels in that mix am I listening to ? 
It ' s a great exercise for improving the quality of your listening.
It ' s a waltz.
Wow!
The next exercise is probably the most important of all of these , if you just take one thing away.
It ' s starting to play with them as levers , to get conscious about them and to move to different places.
And finally , an acronym.
Now sound is my passion , it ' s my life.
That ' s why we need to teach listening in our schools as a skill.
So I invite you to connect with me , connect with each other , take this mission out and let ' s get listening taught in schools , and transform the world in one generation to a conscious listening world -- a world of connection , a world of understanding and a world of peace.
AI,brain,cognitive science,computers,intelligence,memory,science,technology
And today ' s talk is about brains and , yay , somewhere I have a brain fan out there.
Most of you know me from my Palm and Handspring days , but I also run a nonprofit scientific research institute called the Redwood Neuroscience Institute in Menlo Park , and we study theoretical neuroscience , and we study how the neocortex works.
And I ' ve done this because I really believe that mobile computing is the future of personal computing , and I ' m trying to make the world a little bit better by working on these things.
I was looking for a picture of graffiti , little text input language , and I found the website dedicated to teachers who want to make these , you know , the script writing things across the top of their blackboard , and they had added graffiti to it , and I ' m sorry about that.
In September 1979 , Scientific American came out with a single topic issue about the brain . And it was quite good.
Today is , I think , the 50th anniversary of the discovery of DNA.
He didn ' t say we didn ' t even have a theory . He says , we don ' t even know how to begin to think about it -- we don ' t even have a framework.
First , I went to MIT , the AI lab was there , and I said , well , I want to build intelligent machines , too , but the way I want to do it is to study how brains work first.
But I was a little disappointed -- pretty young -- but I went back again a few years later and this time was in California , and I went to Berkeley.
That ' s not something you do . You can ' t get funded for that.
That ' s when I designed all those computer products.
So why should we have a good brain theory ? 
Why do we study ants ?  Well , it ' s interesting.
Rarely , you know : evolution did this and Copernicus did this , where we have a new understanding of who we are.
Another thing is sometimes science leads to really big societal benefits and technologies , or businesses , or whatever , that come out of it . And this is one , too , because when we understand how brains work , we ' re going to be able to build intelligent machines , and I think that ' s actually a good thing on the whole , and it ' s going to have tremendous benefits to society , just like a fundamental technology.
This is normal science.
This works in physics . This works in geology . But if this is normal science , what does neuroscience look like ?  This is what neuroscience looks like.
A lot of data . But there ' s no theory . There ' s a little , wimpy box on top there.
Some people say , well , we don ' t still have enough data , we need to get more information , there ' s all these things we don ' t know.
Maybe we ' ll be lucky and discover some magic thing , but I don ' t think so.
I even think Chris said something like this yesterday.
That ' s always been the case . And so all we can say , well , my neocortex , which is the part of the brain I ' m interested in , has 30 billion cells.
Some people say , brains can ' t understand brains.
It ' s got a lot of cells in it too , right ? 
I can ' t be just a bunch of cells . Well , you know , people used to believe there was a life force to be living , and we now know that ' s really not true at all.
There ' s something we believe that just , it ' s obvious , but it ' s wrong.
First of all , they had a lot of unexplained data . A lot of it.
It just turns out it ' s really hard to think of things , but once you ' ve thought of them , it ' s kind of easy to understand it.
It was an intuitive , strong-held belief that was wrong.
Of course not . You know , and someone who said , well , it was spinning around in space and it ' s so huge , they would lock you up , and that ' s what they did back then.
This is what evolution tells us . And , it ' s true . It ' s kind of unbelievable.
Now I ' m going to tell it to you , and it ' s going to seem obvious that that is correct , and that ' s the point , right ?  Then I ' m going to have to make an argument why you ' re incorrect about the other assumption.
Engineers like to look at systems like this . Scientists like to look at systems like this.
A behavioral metric of what intelligence is , and this has stuck in our minds for a long period of time.
It ' s an eternal metric . There ' s an eternal metric about us sort of saying , do we understand the world ?  Am I making predictions ?  And so on.
The word came into you , and you ' re making these predictions all the time.
Well I ' ll argue a non-intelligent brain , we got hold of an old brain , and we ' re going to say it ' s like a non-mammal , like a reptile , so I ' ll say , an alligator ; we have an alligator.
It can attack . It can do all kinds of stuff.
First thing that happened in evolution with mammals , we started to develop a thing called the neocortex.
No , really , that ' s what it is . It ' s about the size of a table napkin.
It ' s all those things , and all those gut reactions you have.
It ' s sitting there saying , ah , I ' m going to memorize all the things that are going on : where I ' ve been , people I ' ve seen , things I ' ve heard , and so on.
And it ' s this feeding back into the old brain that ' ll allow you to make very more intelligent decisions.
In humans -- by the way , this is true for all mammals ; it ' s true for other mammals -- and in humans , it got a lot worse.
So we are now able to make very sophisticated motor planning , things like that.
And these things happen all the time . You ' re making these predictions.
It may take a second to figure out what it was , but something happened.
And as you go up to the door , you know , let ' s check them off one at time.
As I put my hand on this table , I expect to feel it stop.
And when you look at people , your eyes are caught over at two to three times a second.
And that ' s because you ' re making a prediction.
We test it by prediction . What is the next word in this , you know ? 
So what is the recipe for brain theory ? 
Then , if in that framework , you take a bunch of theoreticians.
Then they have to learn the anatomy , and they ' ve got to learn the physiology.
I would love to have more time to tell you we ' re making fantastic progress in this thing , and I expect to be back up on this stage , maybe this will be some other time in the not too distant future and tell you about it.
Not like computer memory . It ' s not at all like computer memory.
A song must be heard in sequence over time , and you must play it back in sequence over time.
If you don ' t build it , you don ' t understand it . So , one more slide here.
First of all , it ' s going to be built up , we ' re going to build the stuff out of silicon.
Now it ' s very unlikely the first things you ' re going to see are like robots.
So the first thing we ' re going to do are the things that don ' t require a lot of robotics.
Anywhere where we ' re basically using our brain , but not doing a lot of mechanics.
I know a lot of people who invented the microprocessor and if you talk to them , they knew what they were doing was really significant , but they didn ' t really know what was going to happen.
And I ' m most excited about how we ' re going to use them in science.
activism,global issues,humanity,nuclear weapons,peace
I know there have been many challenges made to people.
When I see the symbols of the rainbow and the dove , I think of personal serenity.
This is called human security.
Mom , I ' m really trying.
It is not getting other countries to arm themselves to the teeth with the weapons that we produce and we sell them.
But he ' s offering 84 billion dollars for the modernizing of nuclear weapons.
But it ' s going to modernize weapons we do not need and will not be gotten rid of in our lifetime , unless we get up off our ...
It is having access to medical equipment that can actually tell who does have cancer.
I was in Hiroshima a couple of weeks ago , and His Holiness -- we ' re sitting there in front of thousands of people in the city , and there were about eight of us Nobel laureates.
Your robe gives it away. " 
I don ' t follow that , but that ' s cool. " 
His Holiness , in his robes , is my new action hero.
She was just released a couple of weeks ago , and we ' re very concerned to see how long she will be free , because she is already out in the streets in Rangoon , agitating for change.
She said ,  " You know , we have a long road to go to finally get democracy in my country.
She ' s my friend , Dr . Shirin Ebadi , the first Muslim woman to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
She is traveling because she was out of the country at the time of the elections.
Wangari Maathai -- 2004 Peace laureate.
When she was planting those trees , I don ' t think most people understand that , at the same time , she was using the action of getting people together to plant those trees to talk about how to overcome the authoritarian government in her country.
The Women ' s League of Burma , 11 individual organizations of Burmese women came together because there ' s strength in numbers.
Mairead McGuire in the middle , Betty Williams on the right-hand side -- bringing peace to Northern Ireland.
The children were killed on the spot.
And they have been part of what brought peace to Northern Ireland , and they ' re still working on it , because there ' s still a lot more to do.
She is educating the indigenous people of her country about what it means to be a democracy , about how you bring democracy to the country , about educating , about how to vote -- but that democracy is not just about voting ; it ' s about being an active citizen.
They could maybe volunteer that much.
It ' s not a dirty word.
http://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_and_the_magic_washing_machine.html
Hans Rosling and the magic washing machine
And Grandma was even more excited.
And then , when she closed the door , Grandma said ,  " No , no , no , no.
Give me a chair! I want to see it, "  and she sat down in front of the machine , and she watched the entire washing program.
Look , the homes are full of machines.
Sometimes they don ' t even have enough food , and they live below the poverty line.
They have electricity , but the question is , how many have washing machines ? 
And the remaining five billion , how do they wash ? 
It ' s a hard , time-consuming labor , which they have to do for hours every week.
And there ' s nothing different in their wish than it was for my grandma.
How can we tell this woman that she ain ' t going to have a washing machine ? 
And no one raised their hand.
Here we are.
And it ' s 12 units used in the entire world , and the richest one billion , they use six of them.
And they also have electricity.
What are the trends ?  If we just prolong the trends , without any real advanced analysis , to 2050 , there are two things that can increase the energy use.
And [with] that you will get two extra , but that won ' t change the energy use very much.
And they will start to use as much as the Old West are doing already.
And we hope that the poor people will get into the electric light.
So what needs to be done ? 
They must change behavior in some way.
This is what we hope may happen.
And she became Dilma Rousseff , the president-elect of one of the biggest democracies in the world -- moving from minister of energy to president.
My mother explained the magic with this machine the very , very first day.
Because this is the magic : you load the laundry , and what do you get out of the machine ? 
And she also got books for herself.
And what we said , my mother and me ,  " Thank you industrialization.
http://www.ted.com/talks/erin_mckean_redefines_the_dictionary.html
Erin McKean redefines the dictionary
Here , I ' ll show it to you.
It ' s little discrete -- And those bits are words.
Right ?  It ' s a fun word to say , and I get to say it a lot.
Just to let you know , I do not have a lexicographical whistle.
And for another , deciding what words are good and what words are bad is actually not very easy.
But why do people want me to direct traffic , when I would much rather go fishing ? 
But secondly , I blame the Queen because dictionaries have really not changed.
James Murray , first editor of the Oxford English Dictionary.
And so , James Murray could get a job on any dictionary today.
The thing about computers is , I love computers.
They don ' t change the end result.
The design has not changed.
This is my favorite word , by the way.
This is flat . Look how many links there are in the actual entry : two!
And in fact , online dictionaries replicate almost all the problems of print , except for searchability.
Does everyone know the ham butt problem ? 
So she calls up mom , and she says ,  " Mom , why ' d you cut the butt off the ham , when you ' re making a ham ?  " 
We have a pan that ' s too small!
When they find a word that ' s not in the dictionary , they think ,  " This must be a bad word. "  Why ?  It ' s more likely to be a bad dictionary.
So , if you have a ham butt problem , and you ' re thinking about the ham butt problem , the conclusion that it leads you to is inexorable and counterintuitive : paper is the enemy of words.
Now they ' re going to think  " Oh , boy.
You know , there ' re still going to be paper dictionaries , but it ' s not going to be the dominant dictionary.
What if we made aesthetic judgments about animals , and only the ones we thought were cute were the ones that we could study ? 
Lexicography is really more about material science.
They ' re just the right tools for the job.
Being in the dictionary is an artificial distinction.
And any time one of those little parts of the mobile changes , is touched , any time you touch a word , you use it in a new context , you give it a new connotation , you verb it , you make the mobile move.
You can ask for help!
And I find an un-dictionaried word -- a word like  " un-dictionaried, "  for example -- in almost every book I read . What about newspapers ? 
There ' s a lot going on there.
Tiny , little word , 33 numbered definitions.
That ' s a lexicographical cop out , to say ,  " miscellaneous technical senses. " 
See , I just gave you a lot of words and a lot of numbers , and this is more of a visual explanation.
If this was the dictionary -- if this was the map of American English -- look , we have a kind of lumpy idea of Florida , but there ' s no California!
So again , lexicography is not rocket science.
For instance , there ' s eBird , where amateur birdwatchers can upload information about their bird sightings.
He ' s found more than 140 comets.
But he found 140 comets without a telescope.
Because I ' m going to the Internet , which is where everybody goes.
So there are a lot of really good word-collecting sites out there right now , but the problem with some of them is that they ' re not scientific enough.
Because a word is like an archaeological artifact.
It dies too fast.
And one of the problems of knowing a word like  " synecdochically "  is that you really want an excuse to say  " synecdochically. " 
If we get a bigger pan , then we can put all the words in.
You see , what I ' m really hoping for is that my son , who turns seven this month -- I want him to barely remember that this is the form factor that dictionaries used to come in.
It wasn ' t really what people needed.
Thank you very much for your kind attention.

They have what I called  " logorrhea dementia, "  which is they talk so much they drive themselves insane.
I once -- this was years ago -- I saw Ted Kennedy and Dan Quayle meet in the well of the Senate.
But they have those social skills.
And then he describes the home he owned in their village.
So in the course of my career , I have covered a series of failures.
For 30 years , I ' ve been covering school reform and we ' ve basically reorganized the bureaucratic boxes -- charters , private schools , vouchers -- but we ' ve had disappointing results year after year.
And so that ' s led to a question for me : Why are the most socially-attuned people on earth completely dehumanized when they think about policy ? 
And it ' s produced a great amputation , a shallow view of human nature.
And so this has led to a shallow path in politics , but also in a whole range of human endeavors.
You see these cars that drive up -- usually it ' s Saabs and Audis and Volvos , because in certain neighborhoods it ' s socially acceptable to have a luxury car , so long as it comes from a country hostile to U.S . foreign policy -- that ' s fine.
Babies flop out , they ' re flashing Mandarin flashcards at the things.
And they go to Whole Foods to get their baby formula , and Whole Foods is one of those progressive grocery stores where all the cashiers look like they ' re on loan from Amnesty International.
And sometimes you can see them at vacation places like Jackson Hole or Aspen.
So they ' ve got these furry 160-pound dogs -- all look like velociraptors , all named after Jane Austen characters.
They ' re cross-country skiing up the mountain with these grim expressions that make Dick Cheney look like Jerry Lewis.
And it ' s not based on theology or philosophy , it ' s in the study of the mind , across all these spheres of research , from neuroscience to the cognitive scientists , behavioral economists , psychologists , sociology , we ' re developing a revolution in consciousness.
The first insight is that while the conscious mind writes the autobiography of our species , the unconscious mind does most of the work.
Another finding is that the unconscious , far from being dumb and sexualized , is actually quite smart.
The second insight is that emotions are at the center of our thinking.
And so reading and educating your emotions is one of the central activities of wisdom.
They put them into a brain scan machine -- this is apocryphal by the way , but I don ' t care -- and they had them watch a horror movie , and then they had them describe their feelings toward their wives.
It tells us what to imprint.
We emerge out of relationships , and we are deeply interpenetrated , one with another.
And we see this when lovers walk down the street , when a crowd in Egypt or Tunisia gets caught up in an emotional contagion , the deep interpenetration.
But I think this research shows that the British Enlightenment , or the Scottish Enlightenment , with David Hume , Adam Smith , actually had a better handle on who we are -- that reason is often weak , our sentiments are strong , and our sentiments are often trustworthy.
What it really takes to do well , to lead a meaningful life , are things that are deeper , things we don ' t really even have words for.
Meltzoff , who ' s at the University of Washington , leaned over a baby who was 43 minutes old.
In the United States , 55 percent of babies have a deep two-way conversation with Mom and they learn models to how to relate to other people.
They are what we call avoidantly attached.
A second skill is equal poise , the ability to have the serenity to read the biases and failures in your own mind.
Time magazine asked Americans ,  " Are you in the top one percent of earners ?  " 
But some people have the ability and awareness of their own biases , their own overconfidence.
They are curious.
One of my colleagues at the Times did a great story about soldiers in Iraq who could look down a street and detect somehow whether there was an IED , a landmine , in the street.
And face-to-face groups are much smarter than groups that communicate electronically , because 90 percent of our communication is non-verbal.
It seems so elementary.
And these are skills , again , we can ' t count and measure.
The unconscious mind hungers for those moments of transcendence , when the skull line disappears and we are lost in a challenge or a task -- when a craftsman feels lost in his craft , when a naturalist feels at one with nature , when a believer feels at one with God ' s love.
He was married to a woman named Carol , and they had a wonderful relationship.
And here ' s what he wrote :  " I looked at her face , and I looked so deeply that I felt I was behind her eyes.
Through his suffering , Hofstadter understood how deeply interpenetrated we are.
Now we are discovering a more accurate vision of the unconscious , of who we are deep inside , and it ' s going to have a wonderful and profound and humanizing effect on our culture.

I ' d like to tell you the story of these three children , Pranitha , Shaheen and Anjali.
Shaheen ' s background I don ' t even know.
We still don ' t know who her parents are , who she is.
In this country , and across the globe , hundreds and thousands of children , as young as three , as young as four , are sold into sexual slavery.
They are sold in the name of forced labor , camel jockeying , anything , everything.
I was 15 when I was gang-raped by eight men.
But what lingered from then till now -- I am 40 today -- is this huge outrageous anger.
Right from the age of 15 , when I started looking around me , I started seeing hundreds and thousands of women and children who are left in sexual slavery-like practices , but have absolutely no respite , because we don ' t allow them to come in.
I had this I.S . officer ' s daughter , who is 14 years old , studying in ninth standard , who was raped chatting with one individual , and ran away from home because she wanted to become a heroine , who was trafficked.
Some pay the price for it.
Because the men who come to them are not men who want to make you your girlfriends , or who want to have a family with you.
We are living among those men : they ' re our brothers , fathers , uncles , cousins , all around us.
We think the person likes to do what she ' s doing.
She believes ,  " Yes , this is it , this is what my destiny is about. " 
It ' s in that context that I work.
Because I had lots of them who were already HIV infected.
Understanding my own self , understanding my own pain , my own isolation , was my greatest teacher.
She earns around 12,000 rupees.
They did not have any pardas inside their body , hijabs inside themselves ; they ' ve crossed the barrier of it.
These girls are also working in big construction companies like Ram-ki construction , as masons , full-time masons.
I can ' t hear from my right ear.
My biggest challenge is your blocks to accept these victims as our own.
And there is a long pause.
But it is not nice to bring them to our homes.
That ' s my biggest challenge.
They need your empathy.
And that ' s what I ' m here for , asking for your support , demanding for your support , requesting for your support.
I ' m not asking you all to become Mahatma Gandhis or Martin Luther Kings , or Medha Patkars , or something like that.
They are also part of this world.
I ' m asking you this because no child , no human being , deserves what these children have gone through.

Two years ago at TED , I think -- I ' ve come to this conclusion -- I think I may have been suffering from a strange delusion.
A magazine I ' d recently launched called Business 2.0 was fatter than a telephone directory , busy pumping hot air into the bubble.
And 15 years later , there are 100 of them and 2,000 people on staff and it was just such heady times.
The dotcom , ironically called Snowball , was the very last consumer web company to go public the next month before NASDAQ exploded , and I entered 18 months of business hell.
February 2001 -- in one day we laid off 350 people , and before the bloodshed was finished , 1,000 people had lost their jobs from my companies . I felt sick.
And I think what disgusts me more than anything , looking back , is how the hell did I let my personal happiness get so tied up with this business thing ? 
This has been a big , big transition time , and I believe that this conference can play a big part for all of us in taking us forward to the next stage to whatever ' s next.
And I discovered that while I ' d been busy playing business games , there ' d been this incredible revolution in so many areas of interest : cosmology to psychology to evolutionary psychology to anthropology to .. . all this stuff had changed.
We talk about this a lot , and I thought about trying to give an example of this . So , just one example : Madame de Gaulle , the wife of the French president , was famously asked once ,  " What do you most desire ?  " 
But something as basic as happiness , which 20 years ago would have been just something for discussion in the church or mosque or synagogue , today it turns out that there ' s dozens of TED-like questions that you can ask about it , which are really interesting.
You can view it as a computing problem , an artificial intelligence problem : do you need to incorporate some sort of analog of happiness into a computer brain to make it work properly ? 
And so on , and so on.
And at the end of the four days , your brain is humming and you feel energized , alive and excited , and it ' s because all these different bits have been put together.
Enough of the theory , Chris . Tell us what you ' re actually going to do , all right ? 
You ' re going to have to fuck up really badly to make it bad. " 
That ' s not going to be changed at all.
And I ' m getting fantastic help from the community ; this is just such a great community . And combined , our contacts reach pretty much everyone who ' s interesting in the country , if not the planet.
Books kind of saved me in the last couple years , and that ' s a gift that I would like to pass on.
And then , fourthly : I want to mention the Sapling Foundation , which is the new owner of TED.
I ' m incredibly excited about that.
Artist and TED Fellow Aparna Rao re-imagines the familiar in surprising , often humorous ways . With her collaborator Soren Pors , Rao creates high-tech art installations -- a typewriter that sends emails , a camera that tracks you through the room only to make you invisible on screen -- that put a playful spin on ordinary objects and interactions.
Hi . Today , I ' m going to take you through glimpses of about eight of my projects , done in collaboration with Danish artist Soren Pors.
And as I grew up , it became worse and worse , And I started to think of it as a form of control.
And so as a response and as a gift to my uncle , I made him  " The Uncle Phone. " 
And so I made him a golden typewriter through which he could dispense his commands to nephews and nieces around the world as an email.
So my uncle is only dealing with a mechanical interface.
So how it works is we have these panels , which we have on the wall , and behind them , we have these little creatures which hide.
So we had these panels on three walls of a room.
So when it ' s quiet , it ' s sort of coming out from behind the panels.
You ' ll hear a train in moment that they don ' t react to.
So this is a very early prototype.
And we were quite intrigued with playing with the notion of invisibility.
On the right side you can see my colleague Soren , who ' s actually in the space.
It ' s a very early video , so we haven ' t yet dealt with the overlap and all of that , but that got refined pretty soon , later.
And it was almost like a sheet of paper , like a cutout of a childlike drawing of an oil spill or a sun.
And it would get exhausted , and it would collapse every time.
And it ' s kind of constrained by that circle.
And it very slowly , over a few minutes , sort of painfully goes up , and then it gains momentum and it looks like it ' s almost about to fall.
And it was very important for us to establish the exact moment that it would fall , because if we made it in a way that it would topple over , then it would damage itself , and if it didn ' t fall enough , it wouldn ' t instill that fatalism , or that sense of wanting to go and help it.
But he doesn ' t need to , because it manages to lift itself up on its own.
And the idea was to sort of contrast something very cold and distant and abstract like the universe into the familiar form of a teddy bear , which is very comforting and intimate.
And so this object is constantly expanding and contracting to create a dynamic with people moving around it -- almost like it were trying to conceal a secret within its seams or something.
http://www.ted.com/talks/debate_does_the_world_need_nuclear_energy.html
Debate : Does the world need nuclear energy ? 
So those who are  " yes, "  raise your hand .  " For. " 
Which means we ' re going to take a vote at the end and see how that shifts , if at all.
The saying is that with climate , those who know the most are the most worried.
And Hansen is hard over for nuclear power , as are most climatologists who are engaging this issue seriously.
We are moving to cities . We are moving up in the world.
This is one of the most desired things by poor people all over the world , in the cities and in the countryside.
I would love to have something in the fourth place here , but in terms of constant , clean , scalable energy , [solar] and wind and the other renewables aren ' t there yet because they ' re inconstant.
But one day of coal adds up to one hell of a lot of carbon dioxide in a normal one-gigawatt coal-fired plant.
While the carbon dioxide , vast quantities of it , gigatons , goes into the atmosphere where we can ' t get it back -- yet -- and where it is causing the problems that we ' re most concerned about.
But one of the things we ' re discovering is that wind , like solar , is an actually relatively dilute source of energy.
The power lines are getting overloaded.
It ' s okay on frapped-out agricultural land.
A guy who ' s added it up all this very well is David Mackay , a physicist in England , and in his wonderful book ,  " Sustainable Energy, "  among other things , he says ,  " I ' m not trying to be pro-nuclear . I ' m just pro-arithmetic. " 
We haven ' t even started the American stockpile.
And that would be very interesting in the developing world.
Here is a commercial version from New Mexico called the Hyperion , and another one from Oregon called NuScale.
And here ' s the future.
His team have been making detailed calculations of the relative impacts of different energy sources.
And it also enhances nuclear weapons proliferation.
Nuclear -- there are two bars here.
And this is just the CO2 from the life cycle.
And in China , right now , they ' re putting up five gigawatts of nuclear.
Wind takes about two to five years on average , same as concentrated solar and photovoltaics.
If you look at the air pollution health effects , this is the number of deaths per year in 2020 just from vehicle exhaust.
And so , on the right , you see gasoline emissions , the death rates of 2020.
North Korea did that to some extent.
would be this.
That , because the footprint , as you can see , is just the pole touching the ground.
That ' s the footprint that is always being confused.
Now if we look at nuclear -- With nuclear , what do we have ? 
For example , cellulosic ethanol , to power the entire U.S . vehicle fleet , this is how much land you would need.
For wind , there ' s a larger area , but much smaller footprint.
To power the entire world with 50 percent wind , you would need about one percent of world land.
This is from real data in California , looking at wind data and solar data.
So then here ' s the final ranking.
And we can guarantee a clean , blue sky or an uncertain future with nuclear power.
If you ' re against , put up one.
These diagrams that show that nuclear is somehow putting out a lot of greenhouse gases -- a lot of those studies include ,  " Well of course war will be inevitable and therefore we ' ll have cities burning and stuff like that, "  which is kind of finessing it a little bit , I think.
There are two nations , North Korea and Israel , that have nuclear weapons and don ' t have nuclear power at all.
CA : Mark , 30 seconds , either on that or on anything Stewart said.
You can make it reliable , as I showed with that diagram.
There ' s absolutely no need for nuclear power.
I ' ve come around in the last 10 years.
And in the United States Senate , we need bipartisan support -- only one or two votes are needed -- to move global warming through the Senate , and this room can help.
The first is : be aware of the propaganda.
Secondly , think about this.
And then tell me that each and every one of those trucks and trains isn ' t a potential terrorist target.
Alex : Hi , I ' m Alex . I just wanted to say , I ' m , first of all , renewable energy ' s biggest fan.
However , there ' s a basic arithmetic problem here.
But we ' ve got an opportunity to recycle them into something more useful that enables us to get energy all of the time.
If we ' re going to keep the lights on , nuclear is that solution.
And so the fallacy that we need this resource and we can actually make it in a time frame that is meaningful is not possible.
Because five years from now , it will blow you away what we ' ll actually have as alternatives to this horrible , disastrous nuclear power.
SB : I loved your  " It all balances out "  chart that you had there.
None of those things were stirring.
I used to worry about the 10,000 year factor.
MJ : So we ' ve analyzed the hour-by-hour power demand and supply , looking at solar , wind , using data for California.
Fifteen percent of the entire U.S.
CA : Okay . So , thank you , Mark.
All those in favor , raise your hands.
Just put up .. . Hands up , people who changed their minds during the debate , who voted differently.
You both won . I congratulate both of you.

It ' s during our lifetime that we ' re going to take the Earth , take the people of Earth and transition off , permanently . And that ' s exciting.
In fact , the Earth is a crumb in a supermarket filled with resources.
And then we discovered these things -- gold and oil and fishing and timber -- and it became , you know , a trillion-dollar economy , and now we take our honeymoons there . The same thing will happen in space.
Some images from Mars , 1997.
And of course , the third motivator , one near and dear to my heart as an entrepreneur , is wealth.
But fear , curiosity and greed have driven us.
If you think about what happened at the turn of -- early 1960s , on May 25 , JFK said ,  " We ' re going to go to the moon. " 
They didn ' t know what couldn ' t be done.
But I put forward here , the government is not going to get us there.
We shouldn ' t be happy in standing for that.
The entrepreneurs in the space business are the furry mammals , and clearly the industrial-military complex -- with Boeing and Lockheed and NASA -- are the dinosaurs.
Arguably , it ' s about 100 million dollars a person on the space shuttle.
You know , one -- we have a very unique period in time today.
Let ' s go back to high school physics here.
If you go to one of Vijay ' s micro-power sources , and they sell it to you for seven cents a kilowatt hour -- anybody here fast in math ? 
I have no question that the physics , the engineering to get us down to the point where all of us can afford orbital space flight is around the corner.
And in fact , the large corporations , the governments , can ' t take the risk.
Number of commercial companies out there ?  12 to 15 companies.
We offered 10 million dollars in cash for the first reusable ship , carry three people up to 100 kilometers , come back down , and within two weeks , make the trip again.
Pilot : Release our fire.
Peter Diamandis : Probably the most difficult thing that I had to do was raise the capital for this . It was literally impossible.
I found a visionary family , the Ansari family , and Champ Car , and raised part of the money , but not the full 10 million.
So , they took a bet that no one would win by January of  ' 05 , and I took a bet that someone would win.
Isn ' t that great ? 
There are three or four other serious efforts that will bring the price down very rapidly , I think , to about 25,000 dollars for a suborbital flight.
We spent 11 years getting FAA approval to do zero gravity flights.
Narrator : For a chance to win the first free ticket to space , look for specially marked packages of Diet 7-Up.
Let me talk about the other thing I ' m excited about.
And this is something that we ' re very excited about.
If you put up a prize , you can get literally a 50 to one leverage on your dollars.
This is what happens when you put up a prize , when you announce it and teams start to begin doing trials.
That ' s our value proposition in a prize.
So , prizes work great.
Well , it must be a good idea.
We ' re looking at attacking energy , environment , nanotechnology -- and I ' ll talk about those more in a moment.
Craig Venter has just joined our board and we ' re doing a rapid genome sequencing prize with him , we ' ll be announcing later this fall , about -- imagine being able to sequence anybody ' s DNA for under 1,000 dollars , revolutionize medicine.
Inspired by cell division , Michael Hansmeyer writes algorithms that design outrageously fascinating shapes and forms with millions of facets . No person could draft them by hand , but they ' re buildable -- and they could revolutionize the way we think of architectural form.
As an architect , I often ask myself , what is the origin of the forms that we design ? 
What would these unseen forms look like ? 
I propose we look to nature.
Nature ' s main process of creation , morphogenesis , is the splitting of one cell into two cells.
And by doing so , we can differentiate the surfaces.
We can fold a million times faster , we can fold in hundreds and hundreds of variations.
And if we change where we make the folds , if we change the folding ratio , then this cube turns into this one.
We can apply different folding ratios to different parts of the form to create local conditions.
We can make folds that we otherwise could not make.
But in each case , I didn ' t design the form.
The forms that I showed before were made actually through very long trial and error.
White surfaces have long edges , black ones have short ones.
These forms look elaborate , but the process is a very minimal one.
I chose to design a column.
I started using four cylinders.
The closer one gets , the more new features one discovers.
An architect who ' s drawing them with a pen and a paper would probably take months , or it would take even a year to draw all the sections , all of the elevations , you can only create something like this through an algorithm.
There ' s no randomness involved at all , but it ' s not entirely predictable.
For one thing , one can design many variants of a form , in parallel , and one can cultivate them.
At one point I simply wanted to jump inside this image , so to say , I bought these red and blue 3D glasses , got up very close to the screen , but still that wasn ' t the same as being able to walk around and touch things.
So instead , we decided to take the column , and we decided to build it as a layered model , made out of very many slices , thinly stacked over each other.
And this is a photo now , it ' s not a rendering , and the column that we ended up with after a lot of work , ended up looking remarkably like the one that we had designed in the computer.
It took me several months to design the column , but ultimately it takes the computer about 30 seconds to calculate all of the 16 million faces.
Machines are getting faster , it ' s getting less expensive , and there ' s some promising technological developments just on the horizon.
You can see a different column in the mirror , if there ' s a mirror behind the column that creates a sort of an optical illusion.
In short , we have no constraints.
http://www.ted.com/talks/willard_wigan_hold_your_breath_for_micro_sculpture.html
Willard Wigan : Hold your breath for micro-sculpture
We all seem to think that , you know , if we look down on the ground , there ' s nothing there.
What made me do this work ?  I shall go into my story.
My world was seen as less.
Now , the one time I was in the shed , and my mother suspected something , thinking I was at school.
And all of a sudden ...
So I told her.
But I didn ' t get it.
And I thought ,  " These ants , are they looking for the queen ant ? 
And how I set about that , I got some splinters of wood.
And so they did.
And all I could hear was  " Is this for us ?  " 
It became part of me.
And as I got older , I continued . I showed my mother.
As you can see , that ' s a pinhead.
So I say ,  " How are you going to fit in there ?  " 
So , to cut a long story short , I went home , went underneath the microscope , and I crushed up a piece of glass , crushed it up.
And the actual roof is made up of a fiber , which I found in my sister ' s old teddy bear.
So I decided to slice these up with the tool that I make by -- I sharpen the end of a needle into a blade.
Because that has happened to me.
So I ' m thinking  " How can I do this ?  " 
And I built rubber around the end of the tweezer so it wouldn ' t crush the glass.
And as I was doing it , what happened ? 
Gone.
Because it ' s such a small sculpture , nothing can go wrong.
And the actual windows and the balcony had to be sort of constructed.
I noticed that the house was occupied.
And there you are.
So I didn ' t think he was going to throw Bart off.
I used the needle which has got a slight blade on the end.
Whenever you work on that level , things behave different.
But I had to make a little barrier , going around it , out of cellophane , to stop it moving.
So there is sweat dripping off my head , because I have to carve Homer Simpson like that , in that position.
I experimented with a -- I found a dead fly.
Because I ' ve heard a fly in pain.
And I looked at it underneath the microscope.
So I have to be very quick.
This one took me approximately , I would say , six to seven weeks.
I says ,  " I enjoyed your film . That ' s why. " 
a quarter of a millimeter.
And Charlton Heston is made of a floating fiber , which I took out of the air.
And there was a lady standing by the bus stop.
And then she went ,  " Hmm , OK , he ' s not mad. " 
And I bent it  ' round , and made it into the chariot.
When I did this one , a gentleman seen it and said to me ,  " There ' s no way you can do this , you must have used some kind of machine.
That one took me approximately six weeks.
That one is , more or less , the same type of process.
So it ' s sort of Ellis Island , and seeing America for the first time.
And we all know that is the Hulk.
And made a needle look like the Hulk ' s broken it.
And that ' s how I managed to do it.
That ship there , that ' s made from 24-karat gold.
And that ' s 24-karat gold . And it ' s constructed . I built it.
It ' s almost like doing a surgical operation to get this thing right.
And that was done with a particle from my shirt.
http://www.ted.com/talks/sheikha_al_mayassa_globalizing_the_local_localizing_the_global.html
Sheikha Al Mayassa : Globalizing the local , localizing the global
We have been reminiscing about the latest technologies and the iPods , and for me the abaya , my traditional dress that I ' m wearing today.
Her answer was quite the contrary.
My point is here , people have a choice -- just like the Indian lady could wear her sari or the Japanese woman could wear her kimono.
But at the same time we are reconnecting and reasserting our Arab heritage.
And for us young people , they ' re looking to become individuals and find their differences amongst themselves.
Life necessitates a universal world , however , we believe in the security of having a local identity.
And I think a lot of people in this room , I can see a lot of you are in the same position as myself.
In a time where the world is becoming personalized , when the mobile phone , the burger , the telephone , everything has its own personal identity , how should we perceive ourselves and how should we perceive others ? 
Yes , we do have all the resources that we need in order to develop new cultural institutions , but what I think is more important is that we are very fortunate to have visionary leaders who understand that this can ' t happen from outside , it has to come from within.
Is it because it ' s a soft option ; we have nothing else to do ? 
We ' re here , we ' re part of a community , sharing out ideas and discussing them.
Ask me.
So I think women in our society are becoming leaders , because they realize that for their future generations , it ' s very important to maintain our cultural identities.
In few hours , Shirin Neshat , my friend from Iran who ' s a very important artist for us will be talking to you.
In the same way , Qatar is trying to grow its national museums through an organic process from within.
We want to build our own identities , our own fabric , create an open dialogue so that we share our ideas and share yours with us.
We will open the museum in a few days , and I welcome all of you to get on Qatar Airways and come and join us.
And I think with time , in the years to come we ' ll be learning a lot about our Picassos , our Legers and our Cezannes.
In a similar way , we have created the Doha Film Institute.
Now if you ' ll allow me , I would love to share a one-minute film that has proven to show that a 60-sec film can be as powerful as a haiku in telling a big picture.
Girl : Uncle Khaled . Here , put on the headscarf.
Play by yourself then.
SM : Going back to straddling between East and West , last month we had our second Doha Tribeca Film Festival here in Doha.
It ' s important for two things.
Now over and over again , people have said ,  " Let ' s build bridges, "  and frankly , I want to do more than that.
 " Know thyself, "  that is the journey of self-expression and self-realization that we are traveling.
Familiarity destroys and trumps fear . Try it.
charter for compassion,compassion,global issues,religion
The truth of the matter is otherwise.
And the prophet , in one of his sayings , said ,  " Adorn yourselves with the attributes of God. " 
In every religious tradition , there is the outer path and the inner path , or the exoteric path and the esoteric path.
And they said ,  " Messenger of God , we are battle-weary.
The famous Sufi master Rumi , who is very well known to most of you , has a story in which he talks of a man who goes to the house of a friend , and he knocks on the door , and a voice answers ,  " Who ' s there ?  " 
With much greater humility , he knocks again on the door.
And Rumi ' s stories are metaphors for the spiritual path.
You want your employees to do what you ask them to do , and if they ' ve done that , then they can do extra.
It is this merging of our self with divinity that is the lesson and purpose of our spiritual path and all of our faith traditions.
All we have to do is to get our egos out of the way , get our egotism out of the way.
This is all you . And this is all us.
Our message today , and our purpose today , and those of you who are here today , and the purpose of this charter of compassion , is to remind.
Jung may have called it  " the subconscious. " 
God , Bokh , whatever name you want to call him with , Allah , Ram , Om , whatever the name might be through which you name or access the presence of divinity , it is the locus of absolute being , absolute love and mercy and compassion , and absolute knowledge and wisdom , what Hindus call  " satchidananda. " 
And they have a fight and an argument because --  " I want grapes. "   " I want eneb .  " I want angur. "  -- not knowing that the word that they ' re using refers to the same reality in different languages.
For what defines humanity , perhaps biologically , is our physiology , but God defines humanity by our spirituality , by our nature.
This is also expressed in biblical vocabulary when we are taught that we were created in the divine image.
This is what I understand from my faith tradition , and this is what I understand from my studies of other faith traditions , and this is the common platform on which we must all stand , and when we stand on this platform as such , I am convinced that we can make a wonderful world.
Thank you , and God bless you.
1062
We lived on Robert E . Lee Boulevard.
They were actually modeled on hotrod motorcycles of the 1960s , which I ' m sure my mom didn ' t know.
And I lay on the pavement stretching over that yellow line , and one of my neighbors came running over.
And for the next 38 years , that accident was the only medically interesting thing that ever happened to me.
I was , for all the world , the  " walking guy. " 
And one afternoon , I got a call from my doctor.
And to think that the tumor was in the same bone , in the same place in my body as the accident 38 years earlier -- it seemed like too much of a coincidence.
When they were born at 6:14 and 6:46 on April 15 , 2005 , our otherwise grim , humorless doctor looked at his watch , and was like ,  " Hmm , April 15th -- tax day.
Anyway -- so they had just turned three , and they came and they were doing this dance they had just made up where they were twirling faster and faster until they tumbled to the ground , laughing with all the glee in the world.
Would they yearn for my approval , my love , my voice ? 
 " They ' ll have loving families and welcoming homes , but they may not have me.
Now as soon as I had this idea , I decided I wouldn ' t tell my wife . Okay.
My wife , as I said , she grew up outside of Boston.
And actually , in her defense , if she were here right now , she would point out that , when we got married in Georgia , there were three questions on the marriage certificate license , the third of which was ,  " Are you related ?  " 
You don ' t need the 30-day waiting period.
She was like ,  " Well , I love him , but I would never ask him for advice. " 
We thought our family would already be there.
We kind of went through my personality and tried to get a dad who represented each different thing.
I sort of friend-married each of these guys.
And I snuck out behind , and there was a moat , a fence and a field of cows.
So if you approach them from behind , down wind , you can push them over and they go thud in the mud. " 
 " Will you help be their dad ?  " 
And frankly , although I keep getting asked this , it never occurred to me that anybody would turn me down under the circumstances.
Get off the bus . Seek out what ' s different.
He said ,  " I would approach this journey as a young child might approach a mud puddle.
Two weeks after my diagnosis , a biopsy confirmed I had a seven-inch osteosarcoma in my left femur.
Twenty years ago , doctors would have cut off my leg and hoped , and there was a 15 percent survival rate.
And then I had a 15-hour surgery in which my surgeon , Dr . John Healey at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital in New York , took out my left femur and replaced it with titanium.
And then he took out a third of my quadriceps muscle.
Because in those opening weeks , we all had nightmares.
And they put me in an infectious disease ward at the hospital.
And what you said , Dr . Nuland -- I don ' t know where you are -- made me think of this today.
Of course , I had no hair and no immune system.
People were incredibly drawn.
Instead , it was all-hands-on-deck.
And this also happened to my girls as they began to see , and , we thought , maybe became an ounce more compassionate.
And as I lifted my leg out of bed , she reached for my crutches and handed them to me.
And it made me think -- and I ' ll just note for the record -- one word that I ' ve only heard once actually was when we were all doing Tony Robbins yoga yesterday -- the one word that has not been mentioned in this seminar actually is the word  " friend. " 
And that particularly happened -- there was one in my life -- is this Council of Dads that Linda said , what we were talking about , it ' s like what the moms talk about at school drop-off.
And on kind of the manly-male front , he answers the phone -- I can say this I guess because you ' ve done it here -- he answers the phone ,  " Yo , motherfucker. " 
I was like ,  " David cries when you invite him to take a walk. " 
And he said ,  " A belief in themselves. " 
You may encounter one from time to time , but you ' ve got to find a way to get over it , around it , or through it.
So one day near the end of my journey , I said ,  " Come on girls , let ' s take a walk across the Brooklyn Bridge. " 
Walking upright , we are told , is the threshold of what made us human.
And the biggest consequence of walking on crutches -- as I did for a year and a half -- is that you walk slower.
200 years ago , a new type of pedestrian appeared in Paris.
And it ' s become my own motto for my girls.
There ' s a quote from Moses on the side of the Liberty Bell , and it comes from a passage in the book of Leviticus , that every seven years you should let the land lay fallow.
My lost year was my jubilee year.
And I said ,  " Dr . Healey , if my daughters come to you one day and say ,  ' What should I learn from my daddy ' s story ?  '  what would you tell them ?  " 
As I looked at this list -- to me it was sort of like a psalm book of living -- I realized , we may have done it for our girls , but it really changed us.
And as you all know , anybody with cancer has to get follow-up scans.
I got good news that day , and I stand here today cancer-free , walking without aid and hobbling forward.
So if you go to 23andMe , or if you go to councilofdads.com , you can click on a link.
And every now and then , find a friend , find a turtle , and take a long , slow walk.

I feel that I ' ve fitted in , in many ways , to some of the things that I ' ve heard.
The water was cleaned , but because they got a lot of batteries , they were able to store a lot of electricity.
We want to know about health care.
So there he is with his little laptop computer , but fighting against the might of the pressures -- because of the debt , the foreign debt of Ecuador -- fighting the pressure of World Bank , IMF , and of course the people who want to exploit the forests and take out the oil.
We ' ve talked earlier -- this wonderful talk by Wade Davis about the different cultures of the humans around the world -- but the world is not composed only of human beings ; there are also other animal beings.
I ' ve been studying chimpanzees in Tanzania since 1960.
So this opens up a whole new avenue of research.
So in many , many ways , we can do things today that we couldn ' t do when I began in 1960.
She loves her computer -- she ' ll leave her big group , and her running water , and her trees and everything.
If she has a bad run , and her score isn ' t good , she ' ll come and reach up and tap on the glass -- because she can ' t see the experimenter -- which is asking to have another go.
Chimpanzees , gorillas , orangutans also learn human sign language.
And not only that -- he would sometimes pick a leafy twig and strip the leaves -- modifying an object to make it suitable for a specific purpose -- the beginning of tool-making.
We now know that at Gombe alone , there are nine different ways in which chimpanzees use different objects for different purposes.
It ' s a very wuzzy line.
The long-term affectionate supportive bonds that develop throughout this long childhood with the mother , with the brothers and sisters , and which can last through a lifetime , which may be up to 60 years.
They kiss ; they embrace ; they hold hands.
We find that they show emotions , similar to -- maybe sometimes the same -- as those that we describe in ourselves as happiness , sadness , fear , despair.
They have a sense of humor , and these are the kind of things which traditionally have been thought of as human prerogatives.
They ' re disappearing for the reasons that all of you in this room know only too well.
And this has led in Congo basin , and other parts of the world , to what is known as the bush-meat trade.
And people will pay more for bush-meat , as it ' s called , than for domestic meat -- it ' s culturally preferred.
So , when the logging camp moves , there ' s nothing left.
Were the people that we heard about yesterday , on the Easter Island , who cut down their last tree -- were they stupid ? 
Maybe I can get just a few dollars from this last tree which will keep us going a little bit longer , and then we ' ll pray that something will happen to save us from the inevitable end. " 
We can do it by talking to each other ; we can do it through video ; we can do it through the written word.
And the air is harming them , and the food that ' s grown from the contaminated land is poisoning them.
We ' re harming ourselves around the world , as well as harming the animals , as well as harming nature herself -- Mother Nature , that brought us into being ; Mother Nature , where I believe we need to spend time , where there ' s trees and flowers and birds for our good psychological development.
And the more I talked about the chimpanzees '  plight , the more I realized the fact that everything ' s interconnected , and the problems of the developing world so often stem from the greed of the developed world , and everything was joining together , and making -- not sense , hope lies in sense , you said -- it ' s making a nonsense.
They were feeling despair , they were feeling ,  " Well , it doesn ' t matter what we do ; eat , drink and be merry , for tomorrow we die.
And I looked in the eyes of my little grandchildren , and think how much we ' ve harmed this planet since I was their age.
Roots make a firm foundation.
Hundreds and thousands of young people around the world can break through , and can make this a better world.
So , the Roots and Shoots program involves youth in three kinds of projects.
And the third kind of project : something for the local environment.
It ' s going to depend which part , say , of America they ' re in.
Because they ' re buying into it , and they ' re the ones who get to decide what they ' re going to do.
We want to go and spend time with the old people and hear their stories and record their oral histories.
Everywhere there are children with shining eyes saying ,  " Look at the difference we ' ve made. " 
And then , lo and behold , there ' s another group answering these kids who may be in America , or maybe this is a group in Israel , saying ,  " Yeah , you did it a little bit wrong . This is how you should do it. " 
That ' s not the way to solve problems.
Know the facts , but see how they fit in the big picture.
Jane Goodall : Two , two , I ' m going to take two.
And I believe that a group like this can have a very major impact , not just because you can share technology with us , but because so many of you have children.
But the kids do ask me -- and this won ' t take more than two minutes , I promise -- the kids say ,  " Dr . Jane , do you really have hope for the future ? 
And we ' ve talked a lot about that.
And thirdly , the last speaker talked about -- or the speaker before last , talked about the indomitable human spirit.
And then as I went around the country after that and felt the fear -- the fear that was leading to people feeling they couldn ' t worry about the environment any more , in case they seemed not to be patriotic -- and I was trying to encourage them , somebody came up with a little quotation from Mahatma Gandhi ,  " If you look back through human history , you see that every evil regime has been overcome by good. " 
So , yes , there is hope , and where is the hope ? 
It ' s really up to us.
In his lab , Martin Hanczyc makes  " protocells, "  experimental blobs of chemicals that behave like living cells . His work demonstrates how life might have first occurred on Earth .. . and perhaps elsewhere too.
So historically there has been a huge divide between what people consider to be non-living systems on one side , and living systems on the other side.
But it ' s very simple . It ' s very simplistic.
So what are these characteristics that I ' m talking about ?  These are them.
Life also has a kind of inheritable information.
So how do we do this ?  Well , we use a model system that we term a protocell.
Consider for a moment this quote by Leduc , a hundred years ago , considering a kind of synthetic biology :  " The synthesis of life , should it ever occur , will not be the sensational discovery which we usually associate with the idea. " 
This is how we can start to make a protocell.
And in this particular example , what I took is some membrane molecules , mixed those together in the right environment , and within seconds it forms these rather complex and beautiful structures here.
So that ' s just forming some body stuff , right ? 
We started with a natural occurring clay called montmorillonite.
Certain kind of molecules like to associate with the clay . For example , in this case , RNA , shown in red -- this is a relative of DNA , it ' s an informational molecule -- it can come along and it starts to associate with the surface of this clay.
But if you saw this protocell , you would not confuse this with something that was actually alive.
So some things that are missing is , for example , if you had a flow of energy through a system , what we ' d want is a protocell that can harvest some of that energy in order to maintain itself , much like living systems do.
It ' s a pool of water , and the protocell starts moving itself around in the system.
So it ' s acting , in a sense , like a living system trying to preserve itself.
It reconfigures itself and actually then is able to climb to the highest concentration of food in that system and stop there.
If we count the number of chemicals in that system , actually , including the water that ' s in the dish , we have five chemicals that can do this.
So now that you ' re all experts on protocells , we ' re going to play a game with these protocells.
The second protocell has a different chemistry inside , and when activated , the protocells all come together and they fuse into one big one . Right ? 
So , I added these protocells together to the system , and protocell A and protocell B fused together to form a hybrid protocell AB.
But then something even more interesting happens.
So the way this works is , you have a simple system of five chemicals here , a simple system here . When they hybridize , you then form something that ' s different than before , it ' s more complex than before , and you get the emergence of another kind of lifelike behavior which in this case is replication.
Think of it like a primordial ooze , okay ? 
If you let that go unregulated , you ' ll continue to make and break chemical bonds , forming an even more diverse mixture of molecules that then forms this kind of black tarry stuff in your pan , right , that ' s difficult to wash out . So that ' s what the origin of life would have looked like.
And we put them into one of these experiments , as you ' ve seen earlier , and then we watch lively movement that comes out.
They become very energetic , and able to find the resource in the environment , similar to what we saw before.
So , doing these artificial life experiments helps us define a potential path between non-living and living systems.
This is used in reference to a report in 2007 by the National Research Council in the United States , wherein they tried to understand how we can look for life elsewhere in the universe , okay , especially if that life is very different from life on Earth . If we went to another planet and we thought there might be life there , how could we even recognize it as life ? 
This is similar to having the Sun shining on the Earth , driving photosynthesis , driving the ecosystem.
Now today , I told you about very strange and weird protocells -- some that contain clay , some that have primordial ooze in them , some that have basically oil instead of water inside of them.

Natalie Jeremijenko : The art of the eco-mindshift
Because , really , what I ' m trying to do now is redefine what counts as health.
Because this idea that health is internal and atomized and individual and pharmaceutical is largely an error.
Number four and five were childhood obesity and diabetes-related issues.
People who come to the clinic are called , not patients , but impatients , because they ' re too impatient to wait for legislative change to address local and environmental health issues.
But , of course , affords greater throughput , fewer accidents , and an interesting model of social movement.
And we give them a couple of things to do that , to help them do companion animal devices while they ' re blogging and doing their email.
And then you have to introduce your tadpole and who it ' s named after.
And of course , these endocrine disruptors are things that are implicated in the breast cancer epidemic , the obesity epidemic , the two and a half year drop in the average age of onset of puberty in young girls and other related things.
Very lucky.
And they ' re geographically more limited than you are , because we don ' t know if you ' ve been exposed to persistent organic pollutants in your home , or occupationally or as a child.
Coping with environmental stressors is tricky.
So this was Prozac , this was Zoloft , this was a black jellybean and this was muscle relaxant , all of which were the medications that the impatient was taking.
This guy also liked plain water and the muscle relaxant.
So they drank as much vodka as they did plain water , which was interesting.
And I want to sort of point out the big advantage of framing health in this external way.
And that aggregating effect , that collective action effect , is actually something we can use to our advantage.
What we do is we take a fire hydrant , a  " no parking "  space associated with a fire hydrant , and we prescribe the removal of the asphalt to create an engineered micro landscape , to create an infiltration opportunity.
I just want to say it was sort of a rule of thumb though , there ' s about two or three fire hydrants on every city block.
That 99 percent of the time when a firetruck is not parking there , it ' s infiltrating pollutants.
This is one of the more ambitious ones.
What is the fallout shelter for the climate crisis ? 
Fallout shelter for the climate crisis , I would say , looks something like this , or this , which is an intensive urban agriculture facility that ' s due to go on my lab building at NYU.
It ' s built as a barn raising , using open source hardware.
You understand a solar chimney.
That actually removes about 95 percent of the carbon black , that stuff that , with ozone , is responsible for about half of global warming ' s effects , because it changes , it settles on the snow , it changes the reflectors , it changes the transmission qualities of the atmosphere.
And then I swap it out with the students and actually re-release that carbon black.
Okay , so I want to show you just two more interfaces , because I think one of our big challenges is re-imagining our relationship to natural systems , not only through this model of twisted personalized health , but through the animals with whom we cohabit.
It ' s happening all over the Developed World , probably for loss of habitat , but also because our cities are a little bit more livable than they have been.
This is communication technology for birds . I looks like this.
Recorded Voice : Here ' s what you need to do.
So there was several of these.
Recorded Voice : Tick , tick , tick.
It is in your interests that I ' m healthy , happy , well-fed.
The final project I ' d like to show you is a new interface for fish that has just been launched -- it ' s actually officially launched next week -- with a wonderful commission from the Architectural League.
This is what it looks like.
So there ' s business cards down there that ' ll give you contact details.
So updates from a beaver.
Instead of doing that actually , we ' ve developed some fish sticks that you can feed the fish.
They ' re nutritionally appropriate , not like Doritos.
But in that action , that interaction , by re-scripting that , by changing it into an opportunity to offer food that is nutritionally appropriate , that could augment the nutritional resources that we ourselves have depleted for augmenting the fish population and also adding chelating agent , which , like any chelating agent that we use medicinally , binds to the bioaccumulated heavy metals and PCBs that are in the fish living in this particular habitat and allows them to pass it out as a harmless salt where it ' s complexed by a reactive , effectively removing it from bioavailability.
By actually taking the opportunity that new technologies , new interactive technologies , present to re-script our interactions , to script them , not just as isolated , individuated interactions , but as collective aggregating actions that can amount to something , we can really begin to address some of our important environmental challenges.

They ' re a form of entertainment , they ' re a form of art , a pride of ownership.
He wrote about a car.
And you say , boy , that ' s a lot.
And if you look at projections over the next 10 to 15 to 20 years , it looks like the world car park could grow to on the order of 1.1 billion vehicles.
But the fact remains : the fundamental DNA of the automobile has stayed pretty much the same.
And we wanted to take advantage of Moore ' s Law with electronic controls and software , and we absolutely wanted our car to be connected.
We embodied all of the key components of a fuel cell propulsion system.
So if we would run the video -- But the real key question I ' m sure that ' s on your mind : where ' s the hydrogen going to come from ? 
And it can come from biofuels.
It ' s produced to get sulfur out of gasoline -- which I find is somewhat ironic.
We did an analysis where you would have a station in each city with each of the 100 largest cities in the United States , and located the stations so you ' d be no more than two miles from a station at any time.
But if you built the Alaskan pipeline today , that ' s half of what the Alaskan pipeline would cost.
What we ' ve targeted for ourselves -- and we ' re making great progress for this goal -- is to have a propulsion system based on hydrogen and fuel cells , designed and validated , that can go head-to-head with the internal combustion engine -- we ' re talking about obsoleting the internal combustion engine -- and do it in terms of its affordability , add skill volumes , its performance and its durability.
So since we can ' t predict the future , we want to spend a lot of our time trying to create that future.
that ' s a huge power-generating capability , a mobile power-generating capability.
We find that premise quite exciting.
And a lot of people say , how do you sleep at night when you ' re rustling with a problem of that magnitude ? 
Chris Anderson : Larry , Larry , wait , wait , wait , wait , Larry , wait , wait one sec.
Are you serious about it , and not just , you know , when the consumers want it , when the regulators force us to do it we will go there ? 
And secondly , it ' s a fundamental business proposition.
And there ' s a simple principle of strategy that says : Do unto yourself before others do unto you.
400 years after Hudson found New York harbor , Eric Sanderson shares how he made a 3D map of Mannahatta ' s fascinating pre-city ecology of hills , rivers , wildlife -- accurate down to the block -- when Times Square was a wetland and you couldn ' t get delivery.
The substance of things unseen.
My colleagues and I have been working for 10 years to rediscover this lost world in a project we call The Mannahatta Project.
So , I didn ' t grow up in New York.
Landscape ecology concerns itself with how the stream and the meadow and the forest and the cliffs make habitats for plants and animals.
And on my weekends I would go up , just like all the other tourists , to the top of the Empire State Building , and I ' d look down on this landscape , on these ecosystems , and I ' d wonder ,  " How does this landscape work to make habitat for plants and animals ? 
I started reading about the history and the geography in New York City.
It was once a beach . And this painting has John James Audubon , the painter , sitting on the rock.
And so I ' d go down to Greenwich Village and I ' d look for this hill , and I couldn ' t find it . And I couldn ' t find that palm tree.
It ' s held in a geographic information system which allows me to zoom in.
And if I zoom in to lower Manhattan you can see the extent of New York City as it was , right at the end of the American Revolution.
And just beyond it you can see features that have vanished , things that have disappeared.
They ' re mapping the roads , the buildings , these fortifications that they built.
Or Murray Hill . And this is the Murrays '  house on Murray Hill , 200 years ago.
So , after some work we were able to georeference it , which allows us to put the modern streets on the city , and the buildings , and the open spaces , so that we can zoom in to where the Collect Pond is.
If we take away the streets , and if we take away the buildings , and if we take away the open spaces , then we could take this map.
We can calculate the aspect.
And we built a probability map about where they might have been.
So , we built a model that explains where those fields might have been.
And they have become successional shrub lands , and these then mix in to a map of all the ecological communities.
It was really an extraordinary landscape that was capable of supporting an extraordinary biodiversity.
Where do they get their food ? 
So , we would read in field guides , the standard field guides that maybe you have on your shelves , you know , what beavers need is  " A slowly meandering stream with aspen trees and alders and willows , near the water. "  That ' s the best thing for a beaver.
Or the bog turtle , needing wet meadows and insects and sunny places.
Moreover , we realized that you can start out as being a beaver specialist , but you can look up what an aspen needs.
But you can also talk about sunny places.
And that you can put these on a grid that ' s 1,000 columns long across the top and 1,000 rows down the other way.
Each point is a different species or a different stream or a different soil type.
We call these Muir Webs after the Scottish-American naturalist John Muir , who said ,  " When we try to pick out anything by itself , we find that it ' s bound fast by a thousand invisible cords that cannot be broken , to everything in the universe. " 
Maybe a timber rattlesnake lived there.
You can zoom into any block on Manhattan , and see what might have been there 400 years ago.
So we would take the landscape and we would build up the topography.
So that we would actually take a photograph , flying above Times Square , looking toward the Hudson River , waiting for Hudson to come.
This is the view looking down the Hudson River , with Manhattan on the left , and New Jersey out on the right , looking out toward the Atlantic Ocean.
And we can see this in the geography of the city today.
There is such power in bringing science and visualization together , that we can create images like this , perhaps looking on either side of a looking glass.
But I wouldn ' t have you think that I don ' t like the place on the right , which I quite do . I ' ve come to love the city and its kind of diversity , and its resilience , and its dependence on density and how we ' re connected together.
So if you ' ll allow me a brief epilogue , not about the past , but about 400 years from now , what we ' re realizing is that cities are habitats for people , and need to supply what people need : a sense of home , food , water , shelter , reproductive resources , and a sense of meaning.
Well , what if we go to Madison Square Park , and we imagine it without all the cars , and bicycles instead and large forests , and streams instead of sewers and storm drains ?

Alex Steffen sees a sustainable future
Fill in the blanks.
And , you know , built the society that we now live in.
How much stuff goes through your life , how much waste is left behind you.
Clearly we don ' t have 10 planets.
North Americans , such as myself , you know , we ' re basically sort of wallowing , gluttonous hogs , and we ' re eating all sorts of stuff.
And there ' s more and more people on the way . Right ? 
A third of the people on this planet are kids.
They may not want to be Americans , or Brits , or Germans , or South Africans , but they want their own version of a life which is more prosperous , and more dynamic , and more , you know , enjoyable.
I don ' t need to go into that.
We don ' t know yet how to build a society which is environmentally sustainable , which is shareable with everybody on the planet , which promotes stability and democracy and human rights , and which is achievable in the time-frame necessary to make it through the challenges we face.
You know , what we ' re out there doing is looking for examples of tools , models and ideas , which , if widely adopted , would change the game.
Give you a little peek into our editorial notebook.
One of the biggest levers that we have in the developed world for changing the impact that we have on the planet is changing the way that we live in cities.
Here , for example , is Vancouver , which if you haven ' t been there , you ought to go for a visit . It ' s a fabulous city.
You leave aside what is natural to be natural.
Nature , city . Nothing changes.
This is the Beddington Zero Energy Development in London , which is one of the greenest buildings in the world . It ' s a fabulous place.
You can start to know where things are.
If you ' re somebody who drives , you know , one day a week , do you really need your own car ? 
We could just re-label things.
It takes its inspiration in form from life.
There ' s a lot of this stuff happening ; it ' s really pretty remarkable.
So this , for example , is hydrogen-generating algae.
And there ' s a statistic I often like to use , which is that we ' re adding a city of Seattle every four days , a city the size of Seattle to the planet every four days.
Most of those cites are growing incredibly quickly.
And this is one of the things that we are looking for everywhere.
All throughout the developing world , people are going directly to cell phones , skipping the whole landline stage.
So what we have , increasingly , is cell phones just permeating out through society.
And those solutions are accessible in a different way to people who don ' t have capital . Right ? 
This is a pretty remarkable program using free and open source software , cheap , sort of hacked-together machines , and basically sort of abandoned buildings -- has put together a bunch of community centers where people can come in , get high-speed internet access , learn computer programming skills for free.
So one of the things that that ' s leading to is a sort of southern cultural explosion.
It ' s doing something new . There ' s new things happening.
And it ' s all about this question , in a very artistic and indirect kind of way.
So you also have the ability for people to start coming together and acting on their own behalf in political and civic ways , in ways that haven ' t happened before.
And sort of the big motto of the anti-globalization movement . Right ? 
We need to start doing things like Lula , President of Brazil.
I would keep your eye on this fellow.
 " A Force More Powerful "  is a video game that , while you ' re playing it , it teaches you how to engage in non-violent insurrection and regime change.
And , you know , we don ' t hear those stories enough.
You get , for example , green power spread throughout the world.
You get barefoot solar engineers carrying solar panels into the remote mountains.
These are LED lights that help the roughly billion people out there , for whom nightfall means darkness , to have a new means of operating.
Here ' s a design for distilling water using sunlight.
I mean , that ' s a great design.
This is one of my favorite Worldchanging kinds of things ever.
We ' re expecting to have upwards of 200 million refugees by the year 2020 because of climate change and political instability.
New models for pedagogy for the displaced.

And I think that we will.
I hope that that turns out to be true.

This is a hand-lettered sign that appeared in a mom and pop bakery in my old neighborhood in Brooklyn a few years ago.
They liked to draw the Little Mermaid , they ' d like to draw a smurf , they ' d like to draw Micky Mouse.
If you ' re an amateur , you don ' t have access to our machine anymore.
SOPA stands for the Stop Online Piracy Act.
They want to raise the cost of copyright compliance to the point where people simply get out of the business of offering it as a capability to amateurs.
Now the problem with this model of censorship , of identifying a site and then trying to remove it from the domain name system , is that it won ' t work.
Now to understand how Congress came to write a bill that won ' t accomplish its stated goals , but will produce a lot of pernicious side effects , you have to understand a little bit about the back story.
Which meant that if you fielded average content , you got a third of the U.S . public for free -- tens of millions of users for simply doing something that wasn ' t too terrible.
Cassette tapes , video cassette recorders , even the humble Xerox machine created new opportunities for us to behave in ways that astonished the media business.
And this freaked the media businesses out -- it freaked them out every time.
And Congress did something.
Taping and remixing and sharing with your friends is okay.
But that wasn ' t what the media businesses wanted.
It took them a while to formulate plan B.
It would be , as Ed Felton once famously said ,  " Like handing out water that wasn ' t wet. " 
Every DVD player and game player and television and computer you brought home -- no matter what you thought you were getting when you bought it -- could be broken by the content industries , if they wanted to set that as a condition of selling you the content.
And the main reason it hasn ' t worked is the Internet has turned out to be far more popular and far more powerful than anyone imagined.
Some of the stuff we share is stuff we ' ve made.
But where the DMCA was surgical -- we want to go down into your computer , we want to go down into your television set , down into your game machine , and prevent it from doing what they said it would do at the store -- PIPA and SOPA are nuclear and they ' re saying , we want to go anywhere in the world and censor content.
Because in the end , the real threat to the enactment of PIPA and SOPA is our ability to share things with one another.
And if it costs even a dime to police a user , that will crush a service with a hundred million users.
The real effects of SOPA and PIPA are going to be different than the proposed effects.
The simple thing , the easy thing , is this : if you ' re an American citizen , call your representative , call your senator.
Because this seems like a national issue , but it is not.
That ' s the simple thing.
And the DMCA goes back to the Audio Home Recording Act , which horrified those industries.
They don ' t want legal distinctions between legal and illegal sharing.
And if we defeat these , as I hope we do , more is coming.
Because that ' s the real message of PIPA and SOPA.

And I ' d like to share a 45 year-old love story with the poor , living on less than one dollar a day.
The whole world was laid out for me.
So in 1965 , I went to what was called the worst Bihar famine in India , and I saw starvation , death , people dying of hunger , for the first time.
 " What is this ? 
It made me think.
I said ,  " I want to live and dig wells for five years. " 
But then , I was exposed to the most extraordinary knowledge and skills that very poor people have , which are never brought into the mainstream -- which is never identified , respected , applied on a large scale.
Elders came to me and said ,  " Are you running from the police ?  " 
 " You didn ' t get a government job ?  "  I said ,  " No. " 
Is there something wrong with you you ' re not telling us ?  " 
They said ,  " Please , don ' t bring anyone with a degree and qualification into your college. " 
You have to have a dignity of labor.
A professional is someone who has a combination of competence , confidence and belief.
These are professionals all over the world.
So the college works following the lifestyle and workstyle of Mahatma Gandhi.
And no one can get more than $100 a month.
Whatever idea you have , come and try it.
And it ' s the only college where we don ' t give a certificate.
This is all mumbo-jumbo if you can ' t show it on the ground. " 
They got the Aga Khan Award for Architecture in 2002.
I asked a forester -- high-powered , paper-qualified expert -- I said ,  " What can you build in this place ?  " 
I was in a bit of a spot.
The men should clear out because we don ' t want to share this technology with the men.
Since 1986 , it hasn ' t leaked.
45 kilowatts of panels on the roof.
He knows more about solar than anyone I know anywhere in the world guaranteed.
Unfortunately , they ' re almost half German , they ' re so precise.
We have a dentist -- she ' s a grandmother , illiterate , who ' s a dentist.
All the roofs are connected underground to a 400,000 liter tank , and no water is wasted.
Because the night schools of Tilonia , over 75,000 children have gone through these night schools.
This is what we teach in the night schools.
The prime minister is 12 years old.
She got the World ' s Children ' s Prize five years ago , and she went to Sweden.
And the Queen of Sweden , who ' s there , turned to me and said ,  " Can you ask this child where she got her confidence from ? 
Puppets is the way we communicate.
He ' s my donor.
The attendance must not drop. " 
And she thought for a minute and said ,  " It ' s the first time I can see my husband ' s face in winter. " 
All across the globe , you have this tendency of men wanting a certificate.
Television ?  No.
So we went to Afghanistan for the first time , and we picked three women and said ,  " We want to take them to India. " 
Of course , the women were much more intelligent than the men.
You don ' t choose the spoken word.
This woman went back and solar-electrified the first village , set up a workshop -- the first village ever to be solar-electrified in Afghanistan [was] by the three women.
She actually went and spoke to an engineering department in Afghanistan and told the head of the department the difference between AC and DC.
All these women sitting at one table from eight , nine countries , all chatting to each other , not understanding a word , because they ' re all speaking a different language.
Comes back , goes into the village , says ,  " Well what ' s the story ?  " 
He said ,  " Do you know there ' s a solar-electrified village in Sierra Leone ?  " 
I said ,  " I can ' t , Mr . President.
Gambia : we went to select a grandmother in Gambia.
I said ,  " No , I want to take this woman. " 
Called the husband , the husband came , swaggering , politician , mobile in his hand .  " Not possible. " 
That was his biggest fear.
She handled the national press , and she was a star.
I ' ll just wind up by saying that I think you don ' t have to look for solutions outside.
Don ' t even worry.
 " First they ignore you , then they laugh at you , then they fight you , and then you win. "

20 researchers can stand on a bridge suspended inside of the sphere , and be completely immersed in their data.
This is some of the research that you ' re going to see that we ' re undertaking at the AlloSphere.
Our scientist colleagues are finding new patterns in the information.
And it ' s our attempt to quantify beauty by finding which regions of the brain are interactive while witnessing something beautiful.
You see 12 intelligent computer agents , the little rectangles that are flying in the brain with you.
They ' re actually singing these densities to you with higher pitches mapped to higher densities.
These generative algorithms grow over time , and they interact and communicate as a swarm of insects.
They ' ve discovered a new bond , a new material for transparent solar cells.
You see the electron flow with the streamlines we as artists have generated for the scientists.
We ' ve mapped them into the audio domain , so they ' re singing to you.
What you ' re seeing here right now is a superposition of an electron in the lower three orbitals of a hydrogen atom.
And you ' re going to hear an undulation between the sound.
And they ' re understanding more about quantum mathematics.
We ' ve taken this information and we ' ve made a mathematical model out of it.
We hope that all of you will come to see the AlloSphere.

But evolutionarily , two million years is nothing.
And one of the main reasons our brain got so big is because it got a new part , called the  " frontal lobe. "  And particularly , a part called the  " pre-frontal cortex. " 
Human beings have this marvelous adaptation that they can actually have experiences in their heads before they try them out in real life.
I mean , you know , Ben and Jerry ' s doesn ' t have liver-and-onion ice cream , and it ' s not because they whipped some up , tried it and went ,  " Yuck. " 
Here ' s two different futures that I invite you to contemplate , and you can try to simulate them and tell me which one you think you might prefer.
You probably don ' t feel like you need a moment of thought.
These are the data . You failed the pop quiz , and you ' re hardly five minutes into the lecture.
For the simulator to make you believe that different outcomes are more different than in fact they really are.
Because happiness can be synthesized.
What kind of remarkable machinery does this guy have in his head ? 
Like Sir Thomas , you have this machine.
As a challenge to myself , since I say this once in a while in lectures , I took a copy of the New York Times and tried to find some instances of people synthesizing happiness.
Who are these characters who are so damn happy ? 
He lost his money ; he lost his power.
Vegetably ?  Minerally ?  Animally ?  He ' s pretty much covered them there.
He was ultimately exonerated , at the age of 78 , through DNA evidence.
It ' s  " glorious, "  a word we usually reserve for something like a religious experience.
Harry went back to New York , asked his brother who ' s an investment banker to loan him the 3,000 dollars , and his brother ' s immortal words were ,  " You idiot , nobody eats hamburgers. " 
Well , in 1994 , when Pete Best was interviewed -- yes , he ' s still a drummer ; yes , he ' s a studio musician -- he had this to say :  " I ' m happier than I would have been with the Beatles. " 
Second : spend as much of your life in prison as you possibly can.
 " Oh yeah , right . You really didn ' t have that much in common with her , and you figured that out just about the time she threw the engagement ring in your face. " 
And in our society , we have a strong belief that synthetic happiness is of an inferior kind.
I want to suggest to you that synthetic happiness is every bit as real and enduring as the kind of happiness you stumble upon when you get exactly what you were aiming for.
It ' s very simple.
Now we give you a choice :  " We happen to have some extra prints in the closet.
 " Tell us how much you like them now. " 
Would you like to see it again ?  Happiness!
Now what ' s the right response to that ?   " Yeah , right! " 
OK ?  They remember their childhood , but if you walk in and introduce yourself , and then leave the room , when you come back , they don ' t know who you are.
Like everybody else , they said ,  " Gee , thanks Doc! That ' s great! I could use a new print.
Back into the room , we say ,  " Hi , we ' re back. " 
 " Sorry , Doc , I just don ' t have a clue. " 
These are normal controls , where if I did this with you , all of you would know which print you chose.
Normal controls show -- that was the magic I showed you ; now I ' m showing it to you in graphical form --  " The one I own is better than I thought . The one I didn ' t own , the one I left behind , is not as good as I thought. " 
What these people did when they synthesized happiness is they really , truly changed their affective , hedonic , aesthetic reactions to that poster.
And some situations allow anybody to do it more effectively than other situations do.
Dilbert already knows , of course.
 " Why would you complain about getting free paper ?  " 
 " Ah! Now that you mention it , it does seem a little silkier! " 
This is the difference between dating and marriage , right ? 
You find a way to be happy with what ' s happened.
So we gave them cameras ; they went around campus ; they took 12 pictures of their favorite professors and their dorm room and their dog , and all the other things they wanted to have Harvard memories of.
 " Oh , yes . We need one as evidence of the class project.
In one case , the students are told ,  " But you know , if you want to change your mind , I ' ll always have the other one here , and in the next four days , before I actually mail it to headquarters , I ' ll be glad to "  -- -- yeah ,  " headquarters "  --  " I ' ll be glad to swap it out with you . In fact , I ' ll come to your dorm room and give -- just give me an email . Better yet , I ' ll check with you.
You will never see it again. " 
First of all , here ' s what students think is going to happen.
Both right before the swap and five days later , people who are stuck with that picture , who have no choice , who can never change their mind , like it a lot!
They don ' t like their picture , and in fact even after the opportunity to swap has expired , they still don ' t like their picture . Why ? 
We could do it so that when you take the two pictures , you ' d have four days to change your mind , or we ' re doing another course where you take the two pictures and you make up your mind right away and you can never change it . Which course would you like to be in ?  " 
The Bard said everything best , of course , and he ' s making my point here but he ' s making it hyperbolically :  "  ' Tis nothing good or bad / But thinking makes it so. " 
They can ' t be exactly the same.
In other words : yes , some things are better than others.
When our ambition is unbounded , it leads us to lie , to cheat , to steal , to hurt others , to sacrifice things of real value . When our fears are bounded , we ' re prudent ; we ' re cautious ; we ' re thoughtful.
Moneyman Steve Jurvetson takes TEDsters inside his awesome hobby -- launching model rockets –- by sharing some gorgeous photos , his infectious glee and just a whiff of danger.
By day , I ' m a venture capitalist . On weekends , I love rockets.
Night shots are beautiful , piercing the Big Dipper and the Milky Way.
And the boys get bigger , and the rockets get bigger.
They use solid propellant most frequently.
This one was great : it went to 100,000 feet , but didn ' t quite . Actually , it went 11 feet into the solid clay ; and it became a bunker-buster , drilling down into the clay . It had to be dug out.
Sometimes they just explode before your eyes or come down supersonic.
Steve Jurvetson : This is rare . Here ' s where they realized the computer ' s failed.
SJ : And I ' ll just be quiet.
Things often go wrong.
It ' s a cadence you can ' t quite imagine.

Carmen Agra Deedy spins stories
You still with me ? 
 " You ' re talking to me already . What ' s the matter ?  " 
And I told her I was coming to TED , and she said ,  " What ' s the problem ?  " 
I said ,  " You ' re a peach , ma . Pop there ?  " 
Camaguey is a province in Cuba.
My father is at once quick-witted , wickedly funny , and then poignancy turns on a dime and leaves you breathless.
My whole life , my father ' s been there.
Great story is the art of letting go.
When Lexus wants to sell you a car , they ' re telling you a story.
There ' s stories that you may tell in a small group of people with some good wine.
I ' m telling you this one.
I was born in 19 -- I forget , and I came to this country with them in the aftermath of the Cuban revolution.
But this story only happened a few years ago.
It ' s delicious . It ' s savory.
I called my mother , and she said ,  " Carmen , I need you to come , please.
Any vehicular outing with that woman from the time I was a young child , guys , naturally included flashing , blue lights.
 " No. " 
And that meant that everyone in the family had to sign up to take her to have her hair dyed , you know , that peculiar color of blue that matches her polyester pants suit , you know , same color as the Buick.
That ' s why they call them that.
I show up . She ' s in the carport.
 " I got a surprise for you , baby! " 
Somebody ' s storytelling . Interactive art . You can talk to me.
I said ,  " Is that thing real ?  " 
 " Oh , Jesus. " 
Her daughter , me , the village idiot with the ice cream cone in the middle of her forehead , is still standing there , slack-jawed.
 " How are you doing it ?  " 
I am buckling in seatbelts from the front.
And she ' s whistling , and finally I do the kind of birth breathing -- you know , that one ? 
I said ,  " Ma , pick a lane! " 
So , I think , hey , we can talk . It ' ll be a diversion.
 " You have a license . How long have you been driving ?  " 
I said ,  " Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , but come on , come on , come on. " 
 " Come on . You got a ticket ?  " 
 " If it works , it works , baby.
He gave you a ticket ?  He didn ' t give you a ticket ?  What ?  " 
Now , you have all been at a mall during the holidays , yes ? 
But that doesn ' t happen most of the time , right ? 
It ' s Saturday . It ' s the holidays. " 
But you know.
 " It won ' t upset me . Why ?  What ?  Is something wrong with him ?  " 
 " I read it on the Intersnet . You cannot have children. " 
I ' m an immigrant . We make a space . What I tell you ?  Right there. " 
 " Look , the Chevy -- he ' s coming this way. " 
OK , I want a vote . Come on , come on . No , no.
We ' re doing great . We ' re doing fine.
Of course , her comeback is ,  " When have I embarrassed you ?  " 
 " I ' m coming. "  Italian hand signals follow.
I start , and this is where a child says to me -- and the story doesn ' t work if I tell you about her before , because this is my laconic child.
She carries a mean spiral notebook and a pen.
When she writes the expose in about 20 years , don ' t believe a word of it.
Now , when this kid says I got to look , you know.
 " No , mama , you got to look. " 
I look in bewildered awe : she ' s standing , those Rockports slightly apart , but grounded.
 " No , my daughter , she ' s coming in the Buick.
I don ' t know what part of the country you live in.
Come on , honey , tell it to me. " 
 " I ' m with the little lady . Damn! " 
Like you ' ve never thought that in your life ?  Right ?  Yeah.
 " I ' m not going anywhere. " 
 " Que ?  "  Which means  " what, "  and so much more.
Secret of the trade.
After I say -- let me refresh you --  " have you no shame ?  " 
Intrepid soul.
It ' s a beautiful hierarchy , and it works.
I said ,  " No , I follow little old women around parking lots to see if they ' ll stop . Yes , it ' s my mother! " 
And the girl goes ,  " I know , but , I mean , I swear to God , she reminds us of our mother. " 
They turn then , shoulder to shoulder , and walk away , lost in their own reverie.
 " I ' m going to drive you crazy probably for about 14 , 15 more years , if you ' re lucky , but after that , honey , you ' re going to miss me. "

And the other is that there is an incredible opportunity if we choose the right wireless technologies ; how we can generate a new engine for economic growth and dramatically reduce C02 in the other sectors.
What are catastrophic effects ?  A three degree centigrade climate change rise that will result in 50 percent species extinction.
That is not enough.
What Zipcar does is we park cars throughout dense urban areas for members to reserve , by the hour and by the day , instead of using their own car.
It means that I can choose a car exactly for that particular trip.
And the other remarkable thing is it ' s , I think , the highest status of car ownership.
So , what is the social result of this ? 
People adore the company . And it ' s better , you know ?  They like it.
Maybe I would have bought the ice cream when I did some other errand. " 
And for me , as a service provider , I would never be able to provide you a car for an hour if the transaction cost was anything.
Today , 75 percent of the trips are single-occupancy vehicles , yet 12 percent of trips to work are currently carpool.
How fabulous . Why would you ever want to go by yourself in your own car ? 
Those are the types of things that you will look at and feel.
And it ' s the cost of driving that ' s making people want to be able to do this.
In London , the day they turned the congestion pricing on , there was a 25 percent decrease in congestion overnight , and that ' s persisted for the four years in which they ' ve been doing congestion pricing.
We ' ve tripled the miles that we drive since 1970 and doubled them since 1982.
And what congestion pricing is is that it ' s a technology trial and a psychological trial for something called road pricing.
Why do we travel too much ? 
And wireless technologies make this real-time loop possible.
And what kind of wireless technology are we going to use ? 
You guys are going to be the handsome young guy and I ' m going to be the wise businessman.
These are also called mesh networks.
These laptops , when a child opens them up , they communicate with every single child in the classroom , within that school , within that village.
When the hurricane happened , the only communication system standing was the mesh network.
You can look at the terminal and be able to see precisely where your bus is on the street and when it ' s coming , and you can buy your tickets in real time.
They ' re resilient ; their redundancy is built into this fabulous decentralized design.
How do we create a big network ? 
 " Where did you do it ?  "   " In his car. " 
I guess I just want you to think about that.
Maybe we should use a good one . When are we going to do it ? 
Right now in the transportation sector , we ' re creating these wireless devices -- I guess you guys might have Fast Pass here or Easy Lane -- that are single-purpose devices in these closed networks.
So , we can provide the lowest-cost means of going wireless coast-to-coast , we can have resilient nationwide communication systems , we have a new tool for creating efficiencies in all sectors.
I think this is a more powerful tool than the Interstate Highway Act , and I think this is as important and world changing to our economy as electrification.
Imagine if every one of these buses in Lagos was part of the mesh network.
So , let ' s take control of this nightmare : implement a gas tax immediately ; transition across the nation to road-tolling with this wireless mesh ; require that the mesh be open to all , with open standards ; and , of course , use mesh networks.

My mom left Nairobi , Kenya.
They saw their first dentist , they ate their first hamburger , and they had their first kids.
We grew up , and we grew older.
Life was pretty good.
I graduated from school , and I went on a road trip with two of my closest friends.
2008 and 2009 were a little tougher.
2008 , 2009 were heavy years for me for another reason , too.
And she said ,  " I don ' t love you anymore, "  and it was one of the most painful things I ' d ever heard and certainly the most heartbreaking thing I ' d ever heard , until only a month later , when I heard something even more heartbreaking.
on a Sunday night.
And it was a really heavy time.
And slowly over time , I started putting myself in a better mood.
And then I got excited when it started getting tens of hits , and then I started getting excited when it started getting dozens and then hundreds and then thousands and then millions.
Which African country do you want me to wire all my money to ? 
Flash-forward to the next year and  " The Book of Awesome "  has now been number one on the bestseller list for 20 straight weeks.
Over the last few years , I haven ' t had that much time to really think.
I ' d love to just talk about each one briefly.
It ' s sad , and it ' s not pleasant to talk about , but your husband might leave you , your girlfriend could cheat , your headaches might be more serious than you thought , or your dog could get hit by a car on the street.
One , you can swirl and twirl and gloom and doom forever , or two , you can grieve and then face the future with newly sober eyes.
I love the way that they see the world , because they ' re seeing the world for the first time.
I love the way that they see the world , because they ' re seeing the world for the first time.
That three-year-old girl is still part of you.
There was the first time you walked by the open door of a bakery and smelt the bakery air , or the first time you pulled a 20-dollar bill out of your old jacket pocket and said ,  " Found money. " 
Roosevelt Grier , or Rosey Grier , as people used to call him , grew up and grew into a 300-pound , six-foot-five linebacker in the NFL.
They were tough football players doing what they love , which was crushing skulls and separating shoulders on the football field.
He said that it calmed him down , it relaxed him , it took away his fear of flying and helped him meet chicks.
It ' s a great cover.
And I think when you ' re authentic , you end up following your heart , and you put yourself in places and situations and in conversations that you love and that you enjoy.
So those are the three A ' s.
I would imagine that you ' d have to be pretty aware of your surroundings and appreciating the small wonders that you ' re starting to see in your new world.
And I just wanted to say thank you to you guys.
And my dad says he got off the plane and he went to this lunch and there was this huge spread.
There was lasagna , there was casseroles , there was brownies , there was butter tarts , and there was pies , lots and lots of pies.

Can you believe they ' ve got a date from Morocco ?  " 
And he ' d say ,  " I don ' t know where Morocco is either , but let ' s find out. " 
And I ' d say ,  " I don ' t believe that. " 
There are so many things to be happy about.
We ' ve got airplanes , highway lanes , interior design and horoscope signs.
We ' ve got books , buffets and radio waves , wedding brides and rollercoaster rides.
We ' ve got all that , but we ' ve only got 100 years to enjoy it.
And that moment is right now , and those moments are counting down , and those moments are always , always , always fleeting.
In this emotionally charged conversation with journalist Kurt Andersen , designer David Rockwell discusses the process of building a viewing platform at Ground Zero shortly after 9/11.
Kurt Andersen : Like many architects , David is a hog for the limelight but is sufficiently reticent -- or at least pretends to be -- that he asked me to question him rather than speaking.
Now , as CBS ' s Jim Axelrod reports , they ' re putting the finishing touches on a new way for people to visit and view the scene.
This was -- out of all the tourist sites in New York City -- this was her number-one pick.
To honor and remember.
Tourist : I think that people are very frustrated that they ' re not able to get closer to see what ' s going on.
JA : If you think about it , Ground Zero is unlike most any other tourist site in America.
Tourist : From our hearts , it affected us just as much.
KA : This is not an obvious subject to be in the sensuality segment , but certainly David you are known as -- I know , a phrase you hate -- an entertainment architect.
How did the shock that all of us -- and especially all of us in New York -- felt on the 11th of September transmute into your desire to do this thing ? 
We were really paralyzed.
And I thought it was astonishing to speculate , as if this were a competition , on something that was such a fresh wound.
And that was the mission that we came up with.
There was a school , PS 234 , that had been evacuated down at Ground Zero.
Tom Otterness contributed , Maira Kalman contributed and it became this cathartic experience for us.
DR : Well , it ' s a funny thing.
And there were the most circuitous grand plans that had to do with long-term infrastructure and rebuilding the entire city.
DR : It was not an inclusive group.
So Rick and Liz and Kevin and I came up with the idea.
The families -- the victims of the families -- were going to this pier that was incredibly dehumanizing.
It was devastating to see the simple plywood platform with a rail around it , where the families of the victims had left notes to them.
And then everyone was up on the roof , so I ran up there.
So we went back to the city and said we ' re not particularly interested in the upgrade of this as a VIP platform , but we ' ve spent some time down there.
So dealing with it is just an immediate master plan.
DR : Well , we knew that if it wasn ' t privately funded , it wasn ' t going to happen.
DR : Yeah . So the first thing we had to do was find a way to get this -- we had to work with the families of the victims , through the city , to make sure that they knew this was happening.
There needed to be a foundation in place.
The prices from the contractors were between five to 700,000 dollars.
And I think this was the 21st , and we knew this had to be built and up by the 28th.
DR : In fact , it was as if this was going to be window-washing scaffolding.
And I think people were amazed at two things -- I think they were amazed at the destruction , but I think there was a sense of disbelief about the heroics of New Yorkers that I found very moving.
We ' d have to go back to the beginning to do this. " 
We emailed out letters to as many people as we could -- several people in the audience here -- who were very helpful.
We knew that one way or another this was going to happen.
It seems to me with this , that it was the opposite of that.
That this was a place for people to reflect , to remember -- a kind of quiet place.
And it allows -- by sort of the procession of the movement , up by Saint Paul ' s and down the other side -- it gives you about 300 feet to go up 13 feet from the ground to where you get the 360 degree view.
KA : Your work -- I mean , we ' ve talked about this before -- a lot of your work , I think , is informed by your belief in , or your focus on the temporariness of all things and the evanescence of things , and a kind of  " Eat , drink , and be merry , for tomorrow we die, "  sort of sense of existence.
To think of it as this purely temporary installation ? 
And Kevin Kennon , Rick Scofidio , Liz Diller and all the people within the city -- Norman Lear , who I spoke to four hours before our deadline for funding , offered to give us a bridge loan to help us get through it.
And a day or two before it opened was Giuliani ' s farewell address , where he proposed the idea of all of Ground Zero being a memorial.
So that , very much , is in the realm of things I ' ve been interested in before.
Do you have -- having been as physically involved in the site as you have been doing this project -- have any ideas about what should or shouldn ' t be done ? 
DR : And it also felt a little bit like a kind of competition of ideas , where I think the focus of ideas should be on master planning and uses.
KA : Well , I think that ' s interesting.
And why do we live in places where such dissimilar people collide up against us each day ? 
KA : Which was the building just north of the Towers ? 
KA : Whether it ' s arts , whether it ' s housing , whether it ' s what amount of shopping ? 
And find other ways to encourage the discussion to be against sort of monolithic , single solutions , and more about a multiplicity of things.
DR : We ' re looking from Fulton Street , west.
But were you conscious of memorials ?  The Vietnam Memorial ? 
It ' s 350 people on the committee for Oklahoma City , which is why we thought of this as a sort of ad-hoc , spontaneous solution that expanded on Union Square and the places that were ad-hoc memorials in the city already.
KA : I just want to thank you on behalf of New Yorkers for making this happen and getting this done.

Ellen  ' t Hoen : Pool medical patents , save lives
They were not the only ones.
The U.S . government decided to take action , and forced those patent holders to make their patents available to share with others to enable the production of airplanes.
AIDS , he heard , was lethal , and treatment was not offered . This was at a time that treatment actually existed in rich countries.
Nelson decided to become a treatment activist and join up with other groups.
When you have a patent , you can exclude anyone else from making , from producing or making low-cost versions , for example , available of those medications.
Treatment programs became possible , funding became available , and the number of people on antiretroviral drugs started to increase very rapidly.
People who have access to these drugs stop dying.
What that means is we have the tools to break the back of this epidemic.
Today , all countries are obliged to provide patents for pharmaceuticals that last at least 20 years.
Here you see the patent practices before the World Trade Organization ' s rules , before  ' 95 , before antiretroviral drugs.
There ' s something else that can really scare generic manufacturers away.
Again , deliberate action is needed.
And this is how it works : Patent holders , inventors that develop new medicines patent those inventions , but make those patents available to the Medicines Patent Pool . The Medicines Patent Pool then license those out to whoever needs access to those patents.
They pay royalties over the sales to the patent holders , so they are remunerated for sharing their intellectual property.
They were forced to do so.
He has access to antiretroviral drugs.
Already , I ' ll give you an example.
This has never been done before.
Now we count on the willingness of drug companies to make that happen . We count on those companies that understand that it is in the interest , not only in the interest of the global good , but also in their own interest , to move from conflict to collaboration , and through the Medicines Patent Pool they can make that happen.
Studies show that sketching and doodling improve our comprehension -- and our creative thinking . So why do we still feel embarrassed when we ' re caught doodling in a meeting ?  Sunni Brown says : Doodlers , unite! She makes the case for unlocking your brain via pad and pen.
So I just want to tell you my story.
So I was curious about why there was a disconnect between the way our society perceives doodling and the way that the reality is.
In the 18th century , it became a verb , and it meant to swindle or ridicule or to make fun of someone.
Doing nothing at work is akin to masturbating at work ; it ' s totally inappropriate.
And unfortunately , the press tends to reinforce this norm when they ' re reporting on a doodling scene -- of an important person at a confirmation hearing and the like -- they typically use words like  " discovered "  or  " caught "  or  " found out, "  as if there ' s some sort of criminal act being committed.
Now it turned out to be Bill Gates '  doodle.
I think that our culture is so intensely focused on verbal information that we ' re almost blinded to the value of doodling.
So here ' s a new definition for doodling.
Here ' s another interesting truth about the doodle : People who doodle when they ' re exposed to verbal information retain more of that information than their non-doodling counterparts.
They are visual , auditory , reading and writing and kinesthetic.
This is so nerdy , but this made me cry when I discovered this.
I think that means doodling is native to us and we simply are denying ourselves that instinct.
On the contrary , doodling should be leveraged in precisely those situations where information density is very high and the need for processing that information is very high.
In reality , it is one of its greatest allies.

Sorry , TED.
So in the spirit of full disclosure , I brought some pictures to share.
Water wings -- an inch of water.
And , despite being cursed with my athletic inability , he plays soccer.
Because this is what I do . This is what I teach.
And so when kids sustain a concussion , we talk about them getting dinged or getting their bell rung , but what is it that we ' re really talking about ? 
Forty miles an hour into a fixed barrier -- 35 Gs.
What would you say ? 
Would it be crazy to know , 103 Gs.
How do we know if he or she has sustained a concussion ? 
So given all of that and given how darn neurotic I am , how do I get any sleep at all ? 
But kids are more vulnerable to brain injury.
And here ' s the really alarming part : we don ' t fully understand the long-term impact of multiple injuries.
What you may not be familiar with is that this research was spearheaded by NFL wives who said ,  " Isn ' t it weird that my 46-year-old husband is forever losing his keys ? 
So it ' s going to be really important that he be able to drive me around some day.
If only.
Should your kid play football ?  I don ' t know.
There are some great resources out there.
The second is a resource I ' m personally really proud of.
The second thing is : speak up.
Speak up also with coaching staff.
Maybe offer to spearhead a fundraiser to buy new gear -- which brings us to suit up.
And Tom knows that that little bit of foam in a bike helmet can reduce the G-force of impact by half.
I can ' t say no , but I can guarantee that every time he leaves the house that kid ' s wearing a helmet -- like to the car , or at school.
global issues,technology
where we are looking to find alternate visions of how to create a digitally inclusive society.
So before I start , I want to talk about a little anecdote , a little story about a man I met once in Mumbai.
He has this little 10-square-meter store , where so much is being done.
But then , in the backside , he ' s got this little nook with a few of his employees where they can fix almost anything.
I was a bit skeptical , but then , I decided to give him a Nokia instead.
But then we were wondering whether this is a local phenomenon , or is truly global ? 
Even here in Doha I found this little nook where you can get alarm clocks and watches fixed , and it ' s a lot of tiny little parts . It ' s not easy.
Basically , you don ' t have to necessarily buy brand new things . You have condemned computers that are stripped apart , and you can buy salvaged components and things that you can reassemble in a new configuration.
There ' s the traditional crafts , and then there ' s the technology crafts.
It ' s not taught in universities.
The main thing is a fix-it-locally culture , which is fantastic because it means that your product or your service doesn ' t have to go through a huge bureaucratic system to get it fixed.
So , what we call this is a silicon cottage industry.
So one of the first things we did is this thing called a multimedia platform . We call it a lunch box.
The only thing that they don ' t have is access to resources . They don ' t even have a textbook sometimes , and they don ' t even have a proper curriculum.
How do you make this teacher into a digital gateway , and how do you design an inexpensive multimedia platform that can be constructed locally and serviced locally ?  " 
We went a bought a flashlight with a very big battery , and a bunch of small speakers.
Believe me , those little classrooms are really noisy.
Out comes this , a little lunch box -- form factor.
Often the roofs are broken , so you don ' t have enough darkness in the classroom to do these things.
So we made this box , and we tested it again and again and again , and we ' re going through multiple iterations to do these things.
It ' s basically a little health care screening tool that we developed.
But the problem with that is that we realized after a bunch of research that they are amazing at referring people to the nearest clinic or the public health care system , but what happens at the public health care system is this : these incredibly long lines and too many people who overload the system simply because there ' s not enough doctors and facilities for the population that ' s being referred.
So the real key question was , how do we empower this woman ? 
So what we did was that we converted this device into a medical device.
So , what we ' re going to do is that we ' re going to measure a few basic parameters on you , including your pulse rate and the amount of oxygen that ' s there in your blood.
VV : So I ' m going to start it up . I hope it works.
So it ' s taking a little reading from you.
BG : Great . Good news.
So that was a very simple three-step screening process that could basically change the equation of how public health care works in so many different ways.
Basically this is a micro-controller with a few extra components that can be shipped for very little cost across the world , and that ' s what is all required with a little bit of local tinkering talent to convert the device into something else.

And I was observing what happened to people and their families over the course of their terminal illness.
And in this case , unlike this couple , she was being cared for by her daughter.
So here I get this call from this random guy that ' s having an experience that ' s being influenced by people at some social distance.
And then I realized that these individuals would be connected into foursomes with other pairs of people nearby.
I became obsessed with how it might be that we ' re embedded in these social networks , and how they affect our lives.
And how do they effect us ? 
So this is a slide of some of our initial results.
So , if you look at this image , right away you might be able to see that there are clusters of obese and non-obese people in the image.
Is there more clustering than would be due to chance alone ? 
This here shows , on the Y-axis , the increase in the probability that a person is obese given that a social contact of theirs is obese and , on the X-axis , the degrees of separation between the two people.
And then the next line over says if your friend ' s friend ' s friend , someone you probably don ' t even know , is obese , your risk of obesity is 10 percent higher.
A kind of induction , a kind of spread from person to person.
When we studied these data , we found evidence for all of these things , including for induction.
Another more subtle possibility is that they start gaining weight , and it changes your ideas of what an acceptable body size is.
Blame your fat friends. " 
Our next questions was : Could we actually visualize this spread ? 
Lots of people are doing things at the same time.
We ' re going to put this into motion now , taking daily cuts through the network for about 30 years.
And , by the end , you ' re going to see clusters of obese and non-obese individuals within the network.
And we started exploring all kinds of other phenomena.
Why do we show our emotions ? 
And , not only can they read them , but they copy them.
Now , we ' re accustomed to thinking about emotions in this way , in simple , sort of , brief periods of time.
And so there ' s a very instinctive way in which we briefly transmit emotions to each other.
Maybe there ' s a kind of below the surface , quiet riot that animates us all the time.
Again , a social network , but now we color the people yellow if they ' re happy and blue if they ' re sad and green in between.
So to invoke another metaphor , if you imagine social networks as a kind of vast fabric of humanity -- I ' m connected to you and you to her , on out endlessly into the distance -- this fabric is actually like an old-fashioned American quilt , and it has patches on it : happy and unhappy patches.
But they never look like this.
And notice first of all -- so , to understand this , though , we need to dissect network structure a little bit first -- and notice that every person in this network has exactly the same structural location as every other person.
If you look here at the dots , compare node B in the upper left to node D in the far right ; B has four friends coming out from him and D has six friends coming out from him.
Compare node B in the upper left to node A in the lower left.
And , finally , compare nodes C and D : C and D both have six friends.
But now we , with a bird ' s eye view looking at this network , can see that they occupy very different social worlds.
And now who would you rather be if a juicy piece of gossip -- not about you -- was spreading through the network ? 
And this is not surprising . We know that some people are born shy and some are born gregarious . That ' s obvious.
And we think the reason for this is that some people like to introduce their friends to each other -- you know who you are -- and others of you keep them apart and don ' t introduce your friends to each other.
Now , what is the point of this ? 
They are a kind of social capital.
But if you take the same carbon atoms and interconnect them a different way , you get diamond , which is clear and hard.
And so it is not just what ' s happening to these people -- whether they ' re losing weight or gaining weight , or becoming rich or becoming poor , or becoming happy or not becoming happy -- that affects us ; it ' s also the actual architecture of the ties around us.
Like , for example , a hive of bees that ' s finding a new nesting site , or a flock of birds that ' s evading a predator , or a flock of birds that ' s able to pool its wisdom and navigate and find a tiny speck of an island in the middle of the Pacific , or a pack of wolves that ' s able to bring down larger prey.
I think we form social networks because the benefits of a connected life outweigh the costs.
I think , in fact , that if we realized how valuable social networks are , we ' d spend a lot more time nourishing them and sustaining them , because I think social networks are fundamentally related to goodness.
aging,culture,science
You hear about it all the time.
But make no mistake , longer lives can and , I believe , will improve quality of life at all ages.
So if you ever feel like you don ' t have this aging thing quite pegged , don ' t kick yourself.
Because what that means is that for the first time in the history of the species , the majority of babies born in the Developed World are having the opportunity to grow old.
Through cultural changes , our ancestors largely eliminated early death so that people can now live out their full lives.
Aging brings some rather remarkable improvements -- increased knowledge , expertise -- and emotional aspects of life improve.
The CDC recently conducted a survey where they asked respondents simply to tell them whether they experienced significant psychological distress in the previous week.
Now social scientists call this the paradox of aging.
That is that younger people today may not typically experience these improvements as they grow older.
Originally the sample was aged 18 to 94.
How sad are you right now ? 
And there is a slight downturn.
And other research has shown that older people seem to engage with sadness more comfortably.
And all things being equal , older people direct their cognitive resources , like attention and memory , to positive information more than negative.
In day-to-day life , this translates into greater enjoyment and satisfaction.
Maybe our neural centers in our brain are degraded such that we ' re unable to process negative emotions anymore.
So how can this be ? 
We might spend time with people we don ' t even like because it ' s somehow interesting.
People over 50 don ' t go on blind dates.
We savor life.
By 2015 , there will be more people in the United States over the age of 60 than under 15.
If we invest in science and technology and find solutions for the real problems that older people face and we capitalize on the very real strengths of older people , then added years of life can dramatically improve quality of life at all ages.
The LXD electrify the TED2010 stage with an emerging global street-dance culture , revved up by the Internet . In a preview of Jon Chu’s upcoming Web series , this astonishing troupe show off their superpowers.
I ' m Jon M . Chu . And I ' m not a dancer , I ' m not a choreographer -- I ' m actually a filmmaker , a storyteller.
I mean , this is literally human beings with super-human strength and abilities.
When I was growing up , my heroes were people like Fred Astaire , Gene Kelly , Michael Jackson.
Those guys made me want to , like ,  " I ' m going to do that moonwalk at that bar mitzvah tonight for that girl. " 
And dance has progressed.
dancers have created a whole global laboratory online for dance , where kids in Japan are taking moves from a YouTube video created in Detroit , building on it within days and releasing a new video , while teenagers in California are taking the Japanese video and remixing it with a Philly flair to create a whole new dance style in itself.
So , we created the LXD , sort of a -- the Legion of Extraordinary Dancers , a justice league of dancers that believe that dance can have a transformative effect on the world.
Please be excited , have fun , yell , scream.
And , I don ' t know , I kind of get a kick out of that a little bit.
Kid David : It ' s kind of like , honestly a lot of times I don ' t really know what ' s going on when I ' m dancing.
I got my name just because I was so young.
And instead of throwing it out , people would think that ' s a krump move , that ' s a krump move.
You know , you create power , then you tame it.

The Lakota are one of many tribes that were moved off their land to prisoner of war camps now called reservations.
So I ' ve been asked to talk a little bit today about my relationship with the Lakota , and that ' s a very difficult one for me.
But on Pine Ridge , I will always be what is called  " wasichu, "  and  " wasichu "  is a Lakota word that means  " non-Indian, "  but another version of this word means  " the one who takes the best meat for himself. " 
We are at a private school in the American West , sitting in red velvet chairs with money in our pockets.
The following is a time-line of treaties made , treaties broken and massacres disguised as battles.
According to the treaty , those lands are a sovereign nation.
The execution was ordered by President Lincoln only two days after he signed the Emancipation Proclamation.
In response , three tribes led by the Lakota chief Red Cloud attacked and defeated the U.S . army many times over.
The government also promises land and hunting rights in the surrounding states.
1869 : The transcontinental railroad was completed.
All western Indians at that point in time were now prisoners of war.
1874 : General George Custer announced the discovery of gold in Lakota territory , specifically the Black Hills.
1876 : On July 26th on its way to attack a Lakota village , Custer ' s 7th Cavalry was crushed at the battle of Little Big Horn.
A new agreement was presented to Sioux chiefs and their leading men under a campaign known as  " sell or starve: "  Sign the paper , or no food for your tribe.
1887 : The Dawes Act.
The American dream of individual land ownership turned out to be a very clever way to divide the reservation until nothing was left.
1890 , a date I believe to be the most important in this slide show.
To this day , this is the most Medals of Honor ever awarded for a single battle.
The holy man , Black Elk , said ,  " I did not know then how much was ended.
Everything can be measured before Wounded Knee and after.
They were tired of ghost dances.
1900 : the U.S . Indian population reached its low point -- less than 250,000 , compared to an estimated eight million in 1492.
The court stated that the Black Hills were illegally taken and that the initial offering price plus interest should be paid to the Sioux Nation.
Unemployment on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation fluctuates between 85 and 90 percent.
At least 60 percent of the homes on the reservation are infested with black mold.
Cervical cancer is five times higher than the U.S . national average.
50 percent of the population over the age of 40 suffers from diabetes.
They ' re killing themselves while we watch them die. " 
These are the bones left after the best meat has been taken.
What is the connection between these images of suffering and the history that I just read to you ? 
There must be some call to action.
It ' s not something everyone can get behind the way they get behind helping Haiti , or ending AIDS , or fighting a famine.
The United States continues on a daily basis to violate the terms of the 1851 and 1868 Fort Laramie Treaties with the Lakota.

Sendhil Mullainathan : Solving social problems with a nudge
So , that ' s really the goal of my talk , is to A , communicate that moment to you and B , have you leave this session a little dumber than when you entered.
That ' s why there ' s a glass of water up there.
And so , as a result , there is a lot of death , a lot of death.
This solution has been called , by some ,  " potentially the most important medical advance this century. " 
It ' s brilliant . It ' s a way to get sodium and glucose together so that when you add it to water the child is able to absorb it even during situations of diarrhea.
Still a big number , but a big drop.
Well the easy answer is , we just haven ' t gotten those salts to those people.
Maybe these are the deaths that simple rehydration alone doesn ' t solve . That ' s not true either.
But in this case we cracked it , but a big part of the problem still remains.
Well , it turns out -- and this is where things get really disconcerting -- it ' s not unique to diarrhea.
I ' ll start with insulin , diabetes medication in the U.S.
Massive technological advance : took an incredibly deadly disease , made it solvable.
Here I have a bunch of other examples , all suffer from the last mile problem.
Well , look at some old ways , some ways that we ' d already cracked.
This is the last mile.
This machine is really strange , and one of the consequences is that people are weird.
See , when we were dealing with our biology , bacteria , the genes , the things inside here , the blood ? 
That ' s not as manageable , and that ' s what we ' re struggling with.
Just so you don ' t embarrass yourselves , I ' ll give you the right answer : It ' s increase.
So , if you think of Roman comparative advantage part of it was the breast shields , the breastplates , but part of it was drinking the right water.
Thirty-five to 50 percent of women forget oral rehydration therapy , they are increasing -- they are actually making their child more likely to die through their actions.
I think there is something very profoundly right in what these women are doing.
Now , the model is intuitively right.
This first challenge is what I refer to as the persuasion challenge.
I ' m going to give you a little math problem , and I want you to just yell out the answer as fast as possible.
So , somebody out there says ,  " Five. " 
this is easy , $1.10.
The combination of that produces something that is actually , you got this thing wrong.
Let ' s go back to kindergarten . OK ? 
Let ' s move to kindergarten . Let ' s see if we can beat five-year-olds.
I want you to do it fast , and say it out loud with me , and do it quickly . I ' ll make the first one easy for you.
Audience : Red . Green.
What is all this telling us ? 
I found a problem , a specific problem that actually found an error with that.
You read  " blue "  and you wanted to say  " blue, "  even though you knew your task was red.
BMW is a pretty safe car.
But the truth of the matter is , you look at that car , it doesn ' t look like a Volvo , and it doesn ' t look like a Hummer.
Here ' s another puzzle for all of you.
And they say ,  " You know what ?  Do I need turbo ?  Do I need this heavyweight car ?  " 
See , you have a mental model.
Think about how powerful that is if you ' re trying to encourage fuel efficiency.
Okay , back to BMW . What should they do ? 
They showed a BMW driving down the street.
You can be safe because when you ' re hit , you survive , or you can be safe because you avoid accidents.
You all probably intended to wake up , I don ' t know , 6:30 , 7 a.m.
So far , I ' ve been pretty negative.
Maybe the last mile problem really should be thought of as the last mile opportunity.
You gotta carry the bottle , you gotta carry the syringe.
Here is an innovation , a design innovation.
It ' s much easier to use , much less painful.
But the human innovation , the human problem still remains , and that ' s a great frontier that we have left.
This is about energy efficiency.
And what they find is just this letter , nothing else , has a two to three percent reduction in electricity use.
I think this tells us there is an opportunity.
See what ' s really puzzling and frustrating about the last mile , to me , is that the first 999 miles are all about science.
 " Oh , this is a good idea . People will like this . Let ' s put it out there. " 
Now , I think that we ' re on the verge of something big.
And those vistas will both create new science , and fundamental change in the world as we see it , in the next hundred years.
I mean , it sometimes feels , listening to behavioral economists that they are kind of putting into place academically , what great marketers have sort of intuitively known for a long time.
Forty percent of it is about what marketing is.
That ' s just a caveat . That ' s different from actually having an effective ad campaign.
We work closely with companies that have operational capacity , or nonprofits that have operational capacity.
If you have biological problems we try and fix it , see if it works , and then work the scale.
art,design,education,happiness,humor,work
At the very end of it , I showed a list under that title.
 " Drugs are fun in the beginning but become a drag later on. " 
All of these things are pieces of graphic design.
These are 65,000 coat hangers in a street that ' s lined with fashion stores.
When the magazine -- actually , when I got the subscription -- it was 12 following pages.
It just says  " Money, "  and if you look down the side street , it says ,  " does not make me happy. " 
Singapore was quite in discussion.
If it ' s -- see it for a long enough time , I actually do something about it.
We let that lie around in the sun.
Thank you so much.

If I ' m going to teach my daughter about electronics , I ' m not going to give her a soldering iron.
And these recipes probably look really familiar to any of you who have made homemade play-dough -- pretty standard ingredients you probably have in your kitchen.
You see that really salty Play-Doh ? 
But our homemade play-dough actually has half the resistance of commercial Play-Doh.
Well it means if you them together you suddenly have circuits -- circuits that the most creative , tiny , little hands can build on their own.
If I push these together , the light turns off.
It ' s like a wall to the electricity.
And once you have the basics , we can make a slightly more complicated circuit.
I can start plugging in lots of lights.
We can even add microprocessors and have this as an input and create squishy sound music that we ' ve done.
We have a website , it ' s all there . These are the home recipes.
So I would encourage you all to grab some Play-Doh , grab some salt , grab some sugar and start playing.
Like your uncle at a family party , the rumpled Swedish doctor Lennart Green says ,  " Pick a card , any card. "  But what he does with those cards is pure magic -- flabbergasting , lightning-fast , how-does-he-do-it ?  magic.
My favorite topic is shortcuts.
If you do this , the common , the logic says you must turn the wrist.
You can do it immediately , right ? 
That was a joke , actually , and I -- OK.
Up , don ' t move the wrist . Over the heart , don ' t move the wrist.
But it was six moves . Now with one move.
One move . OK.
She has left . No! A big hand.
I think it ' s enough with water for me . The other guys can talk about -- cheers.
I work with a special method to do it , quick.
Officially , I don ' t gamble but ...
Which one shall have a good poker hand ? 
If a card shark gathers the cards together , immediately when he -- before he deals the card . Now , so I think , number three , I have arranged them in a full house.
I start with three queens.
But also the other hand is good , if all the other guys have good hands too.
These look in order , I ' m probably -- hopefully -- yeah . Three , four , five , six , seven and ...
So the hand that looks so good from the beginning , number three , at the end was actually the lowest hand.
Yes ? 
Here , I can estimate exactly how many cards are put between my royal flush.
So here , I can make a bet , and this is actually one of the points where I get my money.
So here , I think I know about where the cards are.
And that ' s the stealing cards , which I did.
This is a little risky.
Come to -- no , no , no , no.
I work direct with the right brain.
OK . Now , I drop the cards , and you say stop anyway , right ? 
Ah , not in order , it -- that was a mistake.
Yeah , last night I forgot that . That was a mistake.
This deck is bought here in America.
So , but here , and -- is the camera getting too much ?  No.
Then you have to push it down again.
And then , I will demonstrate a thing from Russian satellite , stealen -- stolen , probably copied from America but we will see.
But you know , I think you are familiar with fractals -- the Mandelbrot spirals and all these things.
So now , different persons , older , tap.
I think jack of spades is number 12 from the top.
My fault . Don ' t applaud , this was clubs.
One , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 -- ah , 25 , yes.
When I lift the heap , I peek.
LG : Seven of diamonds . Perfect , my favorite , yeah , seven.
Good , thank you.
LG : Pardon ? 
But now I do it the regular speed , right ? 
LG : Pardon ? 
Five of clubs.
LG : Very good.
And now a card with a contrast of five of clubs.
For example , you are sitting in Las Vegas , and you ' re betting , and you let the other guys peek this card by mistake . Feel , it ' s just the regular , one card.
So here , I grab -- you know this ?  Five of clubs ...
Which card shall I use ?  Queen or five ? 
Eight , nine , 10.
Now some hard stuff.
This is high-frequency laser , and it ' s enough with a fraction of a second to destroy the retina completely.
Did the camera got it ? 
LG : OK , I ' ll take another group.
Ah , good , good , good . But now.
Now -- -- one guy laughed . So now , to find the queen , do it this way : take back the other one , take back the queen.
LG : Spades ?  Spades , good.
Then I arrange them so I can get them quick.
So -- I arrange the spades -- the clubs.
And now and then , I get some extra sympathy points , right ? 
And we switch this to the king.
king of spades.
Maybe you think I have the cards in order already , so you help me to shuffle again.
I like this guy , yeah.
Which size ?  It ' s a piece of cake . I like challenges.
LG : Yeah , Armani . OK.
So , in this case , I try to locate diamonds . I look at the cards , and OK.
Do with both hands , and quick . Yes , good , good.
No ?  Now ? 
Maybe it ' s important -- yeah -- nine of diamonds , OK.
I think I will do it ...
Duct tape.
But it was -- did you hear ? 
Right ?  Good.
But I like her , yeah . I said , be a little tough.
All right.
Diamonds . Ah , I memorized hearts.
Just kidding , warming up -- king of hearts.
I never ever miss two . This is interesting.
Sorry , two of diamonds . I ' ll do it quick now.
Chris Anderson : You ' re peeking.
Try that.
We will try.
Zoe : Five of diamonds , yeah.
LG : Yes ?  You see that in the screen ? 
Yes ?  Zoe : Yeah.
Right ? 
Yesterday -- the day before yesterday , I was in Vegas , and I used this actually.
Yeah . Jack -- you [unclear] with Jack ? 
Misdirection.
One , two , three , four -- mmm!
Good . Oh.
Benjamin Zander has two infectious passions : classical music , and helping us all realize our untapped love for it -- and by extension , our untapped love for all new possibilities , new experiences , new connections.
Probably a lot of you know the story of the two salesmen who went down to Africa in the 1900s.
And the other one wrote ,  " Glorious opportunity.
And rather than go into statistics and trends , and tell you about all the orchestras that are closing , and the record companies that are folding , I thought we should do an experiment tonight -- an experiment.
Maybe you have this child at home.
Then he practices for another year and takes lessons -- now he ' s nine.
Now , what happened was not maybe what you thought , which is , he suddenly became passionate , engaged , involved , got a new teacher , he hit puberty , or whatever it is.
You can see it by looking at my head.
I know -- I don ' t know how we got into this position.
You know , a gentleman was once watching a presentation I was doing , when I was working with a young pianist.
And I moved his body like that , while he was playing.
He said ,  " I was so moved.
My estimation is that probably 45 of you are absolutely passionate about classical music.
You can ' t imagine your life without classical music.
You know , you ' ve come home from a long day , and you take a glass of wine , and you put your feet up.
These are the people who never listen to classical music.
And then there ' s a very small group.
Actually , you cannot be tone-deaf . Nobody is tone-deaf.
You have a fantastic ear . Everybody has a fantastic ear.
But even between those three categories , it ' s too wide a gulf.
It ' s one of the characteristics of a leader that he not doubt for one moment the capacity of the people he ' s leading to realize whatever he ' s dreaming.
This is a beautiful prelude by Chopin . Some of you will know it.
It ' s funny , isn ' t it ?  It ' s funny how those thoughts kind of waft into your head.
Did anybody think while I was playing ,  " Why is he using so many impulses ?  " 
We have a B . This is a B . The next note is a C.
Now , it goes down to A . Now to G . And then to F.
You know , every village in Bangladesh and every hamlet in China -- everybody knows : da , da , da , da -- da . Everybody knows , who ' s expecting that E.
And the critics , all of whom are sitting in the back row there , they have to have an opinion , so they say ,  " Hamlet is a procrastinator. " 
That ' s in order to delay -- until act five , he can kill him.
Now , he gets to F-sharp , and finally he goes down to E , but it ' s the wrong chord -- because the chord he ' s looking for is this one , and instead he does ...
Now , he tries E again . That chord doesn ' t work.
There was a gentleman in the front row who went ,  " Mmm. " 
Almost goes to E , but otherwise the play would be over.
And what you ' re going to see is one-buttock playing.
No , he was thinking about the vision for South Africa and for human beings . That ' s what kept -- this is about vision . This is about the long line.
Would you think of somebody who you adore , who ' s no longer there ? 
Well , I did this at a school in Boston with about 70 seventh graders , 12-year-olds.
Finally , I said ,  " Why am I clapping ?  " 
Now , am I sure that every single person followed that , understood it , was moved by it ?  Of course , I can ' t be sure.
But last night , when you played that piece , he was the one I was thinking about.
Now , how would you walk -- because you know , my profession , the music profession doesn ' t see it that way.
If you thought , three percent of the population likes classical music , if only we could move it to four percent . How would you walk ? 
Now , I had an amazing experience . I was 45 years old , I ' d been conducting for 20 years , and I suddenly had a realization.
And that changed everything for me . It was totally life changing.
And you know how you find out ?  You look at their eyes.
If the eyes are not shining , you get to ask a question.
That ' s a totally different world.
For me , it ' s very simple . It ' s not about wealth and fame and power.
She went to Auschwitz when she was 15 years old , and her brother was eight , and the parents were lost.
And so when she came out of Auschwitz , she made a vow.
Thank you , thank you.

They ' re little . They ' re five years old.
That ' s Sage and Annalisa and Rider.
I want to talk about how the things we ' ve been taught to think about giving and about charity and about the nonprofit sector are actually undermining the causes we love and our profound yearning to change the world.
But it always leaves behind that 10 percent or more that is most disadvantaged or unlucky.
And that ' s where the nonprofit sector and philanthropy come in.
But it doesn ' t seem to be working.
We have two rulebooks.
But we don ' t like nonprofits to use money to incentivize people to produce more in social service.
We ' ll put you on the cover of Wired magazine.
Meanwhile , for the same year , the average salary for the CEO of a $5 million-plus medical charity in the U.S.
Not necessarily . They might be smart.
But we don ' t like to see our donations spent on advertising in charity.
As if the money invested in advertising could not bring in dramatically greater sums of money to serve the needy.
But they have to be asked.
That ' s an important fact , because it tells us that in 40 years , the nonprofit sector has not been able to wrestle any market share away from the for-profit sector.
So Disney can make a new $200 million movie that flops , and nobody calls the attorney general.
If you kill innovation in fundraising , you can ' t raise more revenue.
So Amazon went for six years without returning any profit to investors , and people had patience.
So the for-profit sector can pay people profits in order to attract their capital for their new ideas , but you can ' t pay profits in a nonprofit sector , so the for-profit sector has a lock on the multi-trillion-dollar capital markets , and the nonprofit sector is starved for growth and risk and idea capital.
So we ' re dealing with social problems that are massive in scale , and our organizations can ' t generate any scale.
The Puritans came here for religious reasons , or so they said , but they also came here because they wanted to make a lot of money.
Well , this created a real problem for these people , right ? 
Well , charity became their answer.
Now this ideology gets policed by this one very dangerous question , which is ,  " What percentage of my donation goes to the cause versus overhead ?  " 
But it absolutely is , especially if it ' s being used for growth.
But if it ' s a logical world in which investment in fundraising actually raises more funds and makes the pie bigger , then we have it precisely backwards , and we should be investing more money , not less , in fundraising , because fundraising is the one thing that has the potential to multiply the amount of money available for the cause that we care about so deeply.
Within just five years , we had multiplied that 554 times into 194 million dollars after all expenses for breast cancer research.
And then we went out of business , suddenly and traumatically.
Our sponsor went and tried the events on their own.
We ' ve all been taught that the bake sale with five percent overhead is morally superior to the professional fundraising enterprise with 40 percent overhead , but we ' re missing the most important piece of information , which is , what is the actual size of these pies ? 
Here ' s how all of this impacts the big picture.
The rest goes to religion and higher education and hospitals and that 60 billion dollars is not nearly enough to tackle these problems.
But it ' s never going to happen by forcing these organizations to lower their horizons to the demoralizing objective of keeping their overhead low.
Ask about the scale of their dreams , their Apple- , Google- , Amazon-scale dreams , how they measure their progress toward those dreams , and what resources they need to make them come true regardless of what the overhead is.

So , it can balance on a point.
The bronze is nice hard , durable material that could roll on the ground.
But if you put something on top of it , it disbalances it . And so it would tip over.
And I thought up a lot of ideas.
But it ' s uh -- let ' s see if I can manipulate it a little bit without , um -- oops.
And that ' s what supports the object and keeps it stable.
Representing that eight and a half minutes that it takes light and gravity to connect the two.
And then in a series of 55 balls , it reduces , proportionately -- each ball and the spaces between them reduce proportionately , until they get down to this little Earth.
As you can see the little tether , that it ' s also magnetically levitated.
It ' s made up of 16 concentric shells . Each one has 92 spheres.
And then the Moon in the center , and it ' s floating . And this is in France.
It weighs about a ton or over a ton.
This is another species of work that I do.
So as you turn around you ' re seeing different colors.
And so I placed one more element of each one of them.
This is something I did of a tactile communication system.
It has Buckminster Fuller ' s Dymaxion Map edited here.
So it ' s a floating island with water , fresh water , that can fly from place to place.
And I had a lot of -- always interested in the concept of a crystal ball.
So if we could roll the next film here.
I came with a plan.
The idea of this air genie is , it ' s something that can just transform and become anything.
Here the legs are retracting.
It can generate about a million kilowatts , in order to be bright enough to be visible in daylight.
It ' s completely silent and nonpolluting.
The default image on the object would probably be a high-resolution Earth image.
Or this could represent a college green.
It would be forum for people ' s ideas about what they would like to see on a giant screen of this type.
Career analyst Dan Pink examines the puzzle of motivation , starting with a fact that social scientists know but most managers don ' t : Traditional rewards aren ' t always as effective as we think . Listen for illuminating stories -- and maybe , a way forward.
I need to make a confession at the outset here.
And when I got to law school , I didn ' t do very well.
But today , against my better judgment , against the advice of my own wife , I want to try to dust off some of those legal skills -- what ' s left of those legal skills.
So , ladies and gentlemen of the jury , take a look at this.
Karl Duncker created this experiment that is used in a whole variety of experiments in behavioral science.
Now many people begin trying to thumbtack the candle to the wall.
And eventually , after five or 10 minutes , most people figure out the solution , which you can see here.
Now I want to tell you about an experiment using the candle problem , done by a scientist named Sam Glucksberg , who is now at Princeton University in the U.S.
To one group he said ,  " I ' m going to time you to establish norms , averages for how long it typically takes someone to solve this sort of problem. " 
Now this is several years ago . Adjusted for inflation , it ' s a decent sum of money for a few minutes of work.
Three and a half minutes longer . Now this makes no sense right ? 
Bonuses , commissions , their own reality show.
It dulls thinking and blocks creativity.
But for a lot of tasks , they actually either don ' t work or , often , they do harm.
If you look at the science , there is a mismatch between what science knows and what business does.
Let me show you what I mean.
You : we ' re incentivizing.
If-then rewards work really well for those sorts of tasks , where there is a simple set of rules and a clear destination to go to.
The solution is not over here . The solution is on the periphery.
In western Europe , in many parts of Asia , in North America , in Australia , white-collar workers are doing less of this kind of work , and more of this kind of work.
So what really matters are the more right-brained creative , conceptual kinds of abilities.
The rules are mystifying.
Now , I mean it makes me crazy.
This is not a philosophy.
Let me marshal the evidence here , because I ' m not telling you a story , I ' m making a case.
Okay ?  If you do really well you get the large reward , on down.
Lets go to Madurai , India and test this. " 
What happens ? 
Is this some kind of touchy-feely socialist conspiracy going on here ? 
That ' s the American experience.
Here ' s what the economists there said :  " We find that financial incentives can result in a negative impact on overall performance. " 
We need a whole new approach.
And to my mind , that new operating system for our businesses revolves around three elements : autonomy , mastery and purpose.
These are the building blocks of an entirely new operating system for our businesses.
Management is like -- it ' s not a tree , it ' s a television set.
Traditional notions of management are great if you want compliance.
Let me give you some examples.
And they do something incredibly cool.
Then they present all of the stuff that they ' ve developed to their teammates , to the rest of the company , in this wild and wooly all-hands meeting at the end of the day.
It ' s pretty . It ' s not bad . It ' s a huge trademark violation , but it ' s pretty clever.
Okay ?  Radical amounts of autonomy.
They show up when they want.
Meetings in these kinds of environments are optional.
And I say ,  " Nope . I have proof. " 
A few years later another encyclopedia got started.
Now if you had , just 10 years ago , if you had gone to an economist , anywhere , and said ,  " Hey , I ' ve got these two different models for creating an encyclopedia.
This is the Ali-Frazier of motivation . Right ? 
Intrinsic motivation , autonomy , mastery and purpose , in a knockout . Let me wrap up.
Two : Those if-then rewards often destroy creativity.
We already know this . The science confirms what we know in our hearts.
An orchestra conductor faces the ultimate leadership challenge : creating perfect harmony without saying a word . In this charming talk , Itay Talgam demonstrates the unique styles of six great 20th-century conductors , illustrating crucial lessons for all leaders.
The magical moment , the magical moment of conducting.
You know , this little office of the conductor.
And suddenly , out of the chaos , order.
Not really . If it were that , I would just save you the talk , and teach you the gesture.
And then speak a little bit about how it comes about.
I mean , obviously the orchestra musicians playing beautifully , the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra.
This is the closest to an Oriental bellydancing feast that you will ever get in Vienna.
So that ' s a sort of a tradition.
But what about the conductor ?  What can you say the conductor was doing , actually ? 
 " You come to work . How come you ' re so happy ?  " 
You have the story of the orchestra as a professional body.
People who build this wonderful concert hall.
That ' s a reason to go out of home . Yeah ? 
Yeah , that was very short , but you could see it ' s a completely different figure . Right ? 
Can you sing , please , the first note of Don Giovanni ? 
So please , wait for the conductor.
But -- -- you could see that you could stop an orchestra with a finger.
When Muti is asked ,  " Why do you conduct like this ?  " 
So he says ,  " If I ' m -- if I ' m responsible for Mozart , this is going to be the only story to be told.
 " Why ?  Because you don ' t let us develop.
He ' s a nice guy . He ' s a really nice guy.
It ' s not true . When he was a young man of about 30 , he wrote what he called  " The Ten Commandments for Conductors. " 
So , the whole idea is really to let it happen by itself.
Or he is actually transferring a very strong message to them , saying ,  " Come on guys . You have to play by the book.
So , no , he doesn ' t want that . That ' s a different kind of control.
Did you see this kind of movement ?  Let me conduct you . Twice.
Okay ?  Ready ?  Let ' s do it.
Because you didn ' t know when to play.
They look at Karajan . And then they look at each other.
Because that would prevent the ensemble , the listening to each other that is needed for an orchestra. " 
And he cues in a flute player like this.
Oh yeah . He says ,  " You start when you can ' t stand it anymore. " 
So it ' s a different kind of , a very spiritual but yet very firm control.
No , it ' s not , because he is not telling them what to do.
That is another story.
That ' s what he does.
You have the plan in your head.
This is very exciting for those players.
But of course it ' s not only about motivation and giving them a lot of physical energy.
You ' ll see what happens when there is a mistake.
See , second time for the same player.
You know , when it ' s needed , the authority is there . It ' s very important.
He ' s conducting Mozart.
Rather enjoying what the soloist is doing.
First of all , it ' s a kind of a compliment we all like to get.
When Kleiber does -- did you see the eyes , going from here ? 
And the level in which Kleiber is in control is in a different level.
Kleiber is about conditions in the world.
Do you remember the face of Muti , at the beginning ? 
And you ' re playing a painful sound.
But you can see the music on his face.
And even briefly , you become the storyteller to which the community , the whole community , listens to.
My friend Peter says ,  " If you love something , give it away. "  So , please.

Other stories are that everything is on the verge of unraveling.
I lived in Ireland , built the first straw-bale houses in Ireland , and some cob buildings and all this kind of thing.
And it ' s something so astounding and so astonishing that I think maybe as I remove this cloth a suitable gasp of amazement might be appropriate.
We can turn it into a dazzling array of materials , medicine , modern clothing , laptops , a whole range of different things.
But as we straddle the top of this energy mountain , at this stage , we move from a time where our economic success , our sense of individual prowess and well-being is directly linked to how much of this we consume , to a time when actually our degree of oil dependency is our degree of vulnerability.
There is also the fact that the amount of energy that we get back from the oil that we discover is falling.
And that ' s why , now , the new breakthroughs , the new frontiers in terms of oil extraction are scrambling about in Alberta , or at the bottom of the oceans.
And there is an emerging case that maybe that was what happened last July when the oil prices were so high.
But the thing that I notice , as I talk to climate scientists , is the increasingly terrified look they have in their eyes , as the data that ' s coming in , which is far ahead of what the IPCC are talking about.
We have no choice other than deep and urgent decarbonization.
We had stories like  " The Seven-League Boots "  : the giant who had these boots , where , once you put them on , with every stride you could cover seven leagues , or 21 miles , a kind of travel completely unimaginable to people without that kind of energy at their disposal.
The people who make shoes go to sleep , wake up in the morning , and all the shoes are magically made for them.
And we have the elves in the form of China.
But as we ' ve seen over the last year , I think that ' s an idea that is increasingly coming into question.
The third story is the idea that technology can solve everything , that technology can somehow get us through this completely.
And as we sit , exchanging free ideas with each other , there are still people mining coal in order to power the servers , extracting the minerals to make all of those things.
Energy and technology are not the same thing.
And it is something which has several characteristics.
It ' s solutions-focused . It ' s very much looking at what people can do where they are , to respond to this.
It learns very much from its mistakes.
One of the things that underpins it is this idea of resilience.
When they encounter shock from the outside that they don ' t just unravel and fall to pieces.
Resilience runs much deeper : it ' s about building modularity into what we do , building surge breakers into how we organize the basic things that support us.
So how does this transition idea work ? 
They show films , they give talks , and so on.
There are now over 200 formal transition projects.
But what do they actually do ?  You know , it ' s a kind of nice idea , but what do they actually do on the ground ? 
But all of those things are going to be much easier if we have communities that are vibrant and coming up with ideas and leading from the front , making unelectable policies electable , over the next 5 to 10 years.
Newent in the Forest of Dean : big polytunnel they built for the school ; the kids are learning how to grow food.
This is Lewes in Sussex , who have recently launched the Lewes Pound , a currency that you can only spend within the town , as a way of starting to cycle money within the local economy.
Most of our local authorities , when they sit down to plan for the next five , 10 , 15 , 20 years of a community , still start by assuming that there will be more energy , more cars , more housing , more jobs , more growth , and so on.
From three years ago , it just being an idea , this has become something that has virally swept around the world.
And the head of the council said ,  " If we didn ' t have Transition Stroud , we would have to invent all of that community infrastructure for the first time. " 
But the key to transition is thinking not that we have to change everything now , but that things are already inevitably changing , and what we need to do is to work creatively with that , based on asking the right questions.
And one of the key things that transition does is to pull those stories out of what people are doing.
Personally , I feel enormously grateful to have lived through the age of cheap oil.
And by loving and leaving all that oil has done for us , and that the Oil Age has done for us , we are able to then begin the creation of a world which is more resilient , more nourishing , and in which , we find ourselves fitter , more skilled and more connected to each other.
Bill Gates : How state budgets are breaking US schools
State budgets are big , big money -- I ' ll show you the numbers -- and they get very little scrutiny.
Most education funding -- whether it ' s K through 12 , or the great universities or community colleges -- most of the money for those things is coming out of these state budgets.
Now out of that pie , the government spends 36 percent.
Well what are we taking in ? 
And some of that , in fact , is due to the fact that we ' ve had an economic recession.
There are various things in here : I could say we might raise more revenue , or medical innovation will make the spending even higher.
How could you have a problem like this ? 
There ' s no real , true balancing going on , and in a sense , the games they play to hide that actually obscure the topic so much that people don ' t see things that are actually pretty straight-forward challenges.
But even so , as you go out into those future years , various pension costs , health costs go up enough , and the revenue does not go up enough.
And these were somewhat noticed.
It ' s riddled with gimmicks. " 
They borrow money.
They defer the payments.
So it ' s systemic across the entire country.
And everybody looked at that and knew that that was headed toward a huge problem.
It really is this young versus the old to some degree.
Within the education community there ' s this discussion of ,  " Should it just be the young teachers who get laid off , or the less good teachers who get laid off ?  " 
There ' s ways , if it ' s temporary , to minimize the impact , but it ' s a problem.
There ' s the idea of paying teachers for effectiveness , measuring them , giving them feedback , taking videos in the classroom.
Or even if you ' re flat , you might shift money into it.
Well there really is no brain trust.
The amount of IQ in good numeric analysis , both inside Google and Microsoft and outside , with analysts and people of various opinions -- should they have spent on that ? 
And the numbers are used to make decisions.
We can get some things out on the Internet.
We need better accounting.
It ' s the gold standard.
In fact , there are some like these : Erskine Bowles , Alan Simpson and others , who have gone through and given proposals for this overall federal health-spending state-level problem.
Now I think this is a solvable problem.
And that ' s the kind of thing -- the investment in the young -- that makes us great , allows us to contribute.

James Hansen : Why I must speak out about climate change
I was lucky to grow up at a time when it was not difficult for the child of a tenant farmer to make his way to the state university.
Or was Venus extremely hot ? 
Our instrument took this image of the veil of Venus , which turned out to be a smog of sulfuric acid.
The greenhouse effect had been well understood for more than a century.
In 1981 , we published an article in Science magazine concluding that observed warming of 0.4 degrees Celsius in the prior century was consistent with the greenhouse effect of increasing CO2.
That paper was reported on the front page of the New York Times and led to me testifying to Congress in the 1980 ' s , testimony in which I emphasized that global warming increases both extremes of the Earth ' s water cycle.
So I decided to go back to strictly doing science and leave the communication to others.
But energy policies continued to focus on finding more fossil fuels.
I gave the talk at the University of Iowa in 2004 and at the 2005 meeting of the American Geophysical Union.
I had been using the first line of the NASA mission statement ,  " To understand and protect the home planet, "  to justify my talks.
Adding CO2 to the air is like throwing another blanket on the bed.
Is there more energy coming in than going out ? 
The biggest reservoir , the ocean , was the least well measured , until more than 3,000 Argo floats were distributed around the world ' s ocean.
The total energy imbalance now is about six-tenths of a watt per square meter.
That ' s how much extra energy Earth is gaining each day.
But the measured energy imbalance occurred during the deepest solar minimum in the record , when the Sun ' s energy reaching Earth was least.
These curves for global temperature , atmospheric CO2 and sea level were derived from ocean cores and Antarctic ice cores , from ocean sediments and snowflakes that piled up year after year over 800,000 years forming a two-mile thick ice sheet.
But that lag is exactly what is expected.
A warmer ocean releases CO2 , just as a warm Coca-Cola does.
The physics does not change.
Precise measurements by GRACE , the gravity satellite , reveal that both Greenland and Antarctica are now losing mass , several hundred cubic kilometers per year.
The last time CO2 was 390 ppm , today ' s value , sea level was higher by at least 15 meters , 50 feet.
The important point is that we will have started a process that is out of humanity ' s control.
Hundreds of New Orleans-like devastations around the world.
The Texas , Oklahoma , Mexico heatwave and drought last year , Moscow the year before and Europe in 2003 , were all exceptional events , more than three standard deviations outside the norm.
An important impact , if global warming continues , will be on the breadbasket of our nation and the world , the Midwest and Great Plains , which are expected to become prone to extreme droughts , worse than the Dust Bowl , within just a few decades , if we let global warming continue.
Here at age two and a half years , he thinks he can protect his two and a half-day-old little sister.
This fee and dividend would stimulate the economy and innovations , creating millions of jobs.
Does not enlarge government.
This path , if continued , guarantees that we will pass tipping points leading to ice sheet disintegration that will accelerate out of control of future generations.
That is the equivalent of what we face now.
If we wait 10 years , it is 15 percent per year -- extremely difficult and expensive , perhaps impossible.
The science is clear.
At his day job , Steve Truglia flips cars , walks through fire and falls out of buildings -- pushing technology to make stunts bigger , safer , more awesome . He talks us through his next stunt : the highest jump ever attempted , from the very edge of space.
I ' m extremely excited to be given the opportunity to come and speak to you today about what I consider to be the biggest stunt on Earth.
What I ' d like to do first is take you through a very brief helicopter ride of stunts and the stunts industry in the movies and in television , and show you how technology has started to interface with the physical skills of the stunt performer in a way that makes the stunts bigger and actually makes them safer than they ' ve ever been before.
It ' s critical now that when a car crash happens it isn ' t just the stunt person we make safe , it ' s the crew.
In the old days of the silent movies -- Harold Lloyd here , hanging famously from the clock hands -- a lot of these guys did their own stunts . They were quite remarkable.
You can see from the slide , very very strong.
He worked with John Wayne and most of those old punch-ups you see in the Westerns . Yakima was either there or he stunt coordinated.
Talking of dangerous stunts and bringing things slightly up to date , some of the most dangerous stunts we do as stunt people are fire stunts.
Highly dangerous , but also you ' ll notice it doesn ' t look as though I ' m wearing anything underneath the suit.
One of the things that a stuntman often does , and you ' ll see it every time in the big movies , is be blown through the air.
It ' s a frightening piece of equipment for the novice stunt performer , because it will break your legs very , very quickly if you land on it wrong.
Which I ' m sure you wouldn ' t want.
Being run over is never easy.
Showing how stunts work in different areas , really.
And you can ' t see it from there , but the engine was in the driver ' s lap.
We used to have to drive up a ramp , and we still do sometimes.
We can flip lorries , coaches , buses , anything over with a nitrogen cannon with enough power.
 " Well , we can flip the bus over , we can have it burst into flames , and how about someone , you know , big explosion. " 
A loop-the-loop , biggest in the world.
Well , you ' d die if you did that.
So again , science helps us , and with the engineering too -- the modifications to the car and the wheel.
It ' s a bouncy castle with slats in the side to allow the air to escape.
They used to use cardboard boxes years ago and we still use them.
Not the cardboard box , but the green screen.
With the green screen we can put any background in the world on it , moving or still , and I can assure you , nowadays you can ' t see the joint.
We fly people on wires , like this.
And again , technology meant that I could do the fastest abseil over 100 meters , and stop within a couple of feet of the ground without melting the rope with the friction , because of the alloys I used in the descender device.
And aerial stunts . No aerial stunt would be the same without skydiving.
And I ' d just like to show you a little footage of what he did back then.
They first dropped some dummies.
These are the dummies being dropped from 100,000 feet , and there is the camera that ' s strapped to them.
So it ' s an extremely hostile place to be.
I spoke with him on the phone a few months ago.
This is him in a pressure suit.
You need a pressure suit.
Not even a jet engine.
And it ' s made of polyethylene , so it ' s very thin.
And what must that feel like ? 
You can just see them there , popping open.
Now just to give you some perspective of this balloon , the little black dots are people.
And they ' ve made a dummy of him . That ' s exactly what it looked like.
This is Morocco last year in the Atlas mountains , training in preparation for some high altitude jumps.
Trying to find a space suit to do this has led me to an area of technology that I never really expected when I set about doing this.
And it weighs 300 pounds and you can ' t skydive in it.
It was made by a Russian that ' s designed most of the suits of the past 18 years for the Soviets.
In six seconds you ' ve lost consciousness . In 10 seconds you ' re dead.
We expect , and others expect , that perhaps the FAA , the CAA might say ,  " You need to put someone in a suit that ' s not inflated , that ' s connected to the aircraft. " 
I was going to wear it , but I thought I ' d get Costa to do it , my lovely assistant.
This is a very lightweight suit . It weighs about 15 pounds.
And it doesn ' t look far different when it ' s inflated , as you can see from the picture down there.
I ' m confident that we ' ll find one.
http://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity.html
Ken Robinson says schools kill creativity
There have been three themes , haven ' t there , running through the conference , which are relevant to what I want to talk about.
If you ' re at a dinner party , and you say you work in education -- actually , you ' re not often at dinner parties , frankly , if you work in education.
and you say you work in education , you can see the blood run from their face . They ' re like ,  " Oh my God, "  you know ,  " Why me ?  My one night out all week. " 
We have a huge vested interest in it , partly because it ' s education that ' s meant to take us into this future that we can ' t grasp.
What you have there is a person of extraordinary dedication who found a talent . And my contention is , all kids have tremendous talents.
Thank you very much . So , 15 minutes left.
And the girl said ,  " I ' m drawing a picture of God. " 
If we ' re being strict about it , wherever he went , he was four that year.
You may have seen it :  " Nativity II. "  But James got the part of Joseph , which we were thrilled about.
This really happened . We were sitting there and I think they just went out of sequence , because we talked to the little boy afterward and we said ,  " You OK with that ?  "  And he said ,  " Yeah , why ?  Was that wrong ?  " 
And the third boy said ,  " Frank sent this. " 
Now , I don ' t mean to say that being wrong is the same thing as being creative.
We stigmatize mistakes . And we ' re now running national education systems where mistakes are the worst thing you can make.
I lived in Stratford-on-Avon until about five years ago.
You don ' t think of Shakespeare having a father , do you ? 
And stop speaking like that . It ' s confusing everybody. " 
He didn ' t want to come to Los Angeles . He loved it , but he had a girlfriend in England . This was the love of his life , Sarah.
And we were rather pleased about that , frankly , because she was the main reason we were leaving the country.
At the top are mathematics and languages , then the humanities , and the bottom are the arts.
Why not ?  I think this is rather important.
Truthfully , what happens is , as children grow up , we start to educate them progressively from the waist up . And then we focus on their heads.
They ' re the people who come out the top.
There ' s something curious about professors in my experience -- not all of them , but typically -- they live in their heads.
It ' s a way of getting their head to meetings.
And there ' s a reason.
Number one , that the most useful subjects for work are at the top . So you were probably steered benignly away from things at school when you were a kid , things you liked , on the grounds that you would never get a job doing that . Is that right ? 
If you think of it , the whole system of public education around the world is a protracted process of university entrance.
More people , and it ' s the combination of all the things we ' ve talked about -- technology and its transformation effect on work , and demography and the huge explosion in population.
And I didn ' t want one , frankly.
We know three things about intelligence.
If you look at the interactions of a human brain , as we heard yesterday from a number of presentations , intelligence is wonderfully interactive.
Following off from Helen yesterday , I think this is probably why women are better at multi-tasking.
But you know , she ' s doing -- no , she ' s good at some things -- but if she ' s cooking , you know , she ' s dealing with people on the phone , she ' s talking to the kids , she ' s painting the ceiling , she ' s doing open-heart surgery over here.
I saw a great t-shirt really recently which said ,  " If a man speaks his mind in a forest , and no woman hears him , is he still wrong ?  " 
She ' s wonderful . I used to be on the board of the Royal Ballet in England , as you can see.
Anyway , she went to see this specialist . So , this oak-paneled room , and she was there with her mother , and she was led and sat on this chair at the end , and she sat on her hands for 20 minutes while this man talked to her mother about all the problems Gillian was having at school . And at the end of it -- because she was disturbing people ; her homework was always late ; and so on , little kid of eight -- in the end , the doctor went and sat next to Gillian and said ,  " Gillian , I ' ve listened to all these things that your mother ' s told me , and I need to speak to her privately. " 
Take her to a dance school. " 
People who had to move to think. "  Who had to move to think.
I believe our only hope for the future is to adopt a new conception of human ecology , one in which we start to reconstitute our conception of the richness of human capacity.
If all human beings disappeared from the earth , within 50 years all forms of life would flourish. " 
By the way -- we may not see this future , but they will . And our job is to help them make something of it . Thank you very much.
Jamil Abu-Wardeh : The Axis of Evil Middle East Comedy Tour
I think humor is a great way to celebrate our differences.
Now is the time for us to laugh at ourselves , before others can laugh with us.
An unfortunate connection for us maybe , but it reminds me that we ' d like to thank one man for , over the past decade , working tirelessly to support comedians all around the world , specifically comedians with a Middle Eastern background.
And wherever they went , they killed.
Now , the American head of programming wanted new local Arabic comedy.
And I had every intention of taking this tribe from being outliers in the Middle East and pushing them over the tipping point towards success.
Then I ' d bring my friends , and we ' d show local amateurs how it ' s done.
Now , fast forward two years , to early 2007.
Our new French CEO believed in the power of positive PR ...
I invited our new CEO , and as soon as he realized we had a room packed full of laughing infidels , his reaction was very simple :  " Let ' s make this happen.
This is all true.
Oh course , you might think , what ' s left without bolitics , sex and religion , how can you make people laugh ? 
We had millions see them on TV and on TV news.
So everywhere we went , we auditioned amateurs.
And all this TV and Internet exposure has led to a great many recruits to our cause.
20 years ago , no one had heard of it.
These comics are now going to the New York festival.
The reporter did a great job , and I thank her , but somebody forgot to send the positive PR email to the person operating the automatic news ticker that appears at the bottom.
Enough.
Here are three questions that I like to use to test the truthiness of our representation in any media story.
Clearly , there are wrongs that need to be righted.
Let ' s change the narrative together and let ' s start righting writing wrongs.
http://www.ted.com/talks/shukla_bose_teaching_one_child_at_a_time.html
Shukla Bose : Teaching one child at a time
I was 26 years in the corporate world , trying to make organizations profitable.
We couldn ' t go to all the slums , but we tried to cover as much as we could.
We were all excited to start , but the numbers hit us then : 200 million children between four to 14 that should be going to school , but do not ; 100 million children who go to school but cannot read ; 125 million who cannot do basic maths.
Those numbers were absolutely mind-boggling , overwhelming , and we were constantly asked ,  " When will you start ?  How many schools will you start ? 
It was very difficult not to get scared , not to get daunted.
The first Parikrma school started in a slum where there were 70,000 people living below the poverty line.
Indian academic year begins in June.
Then came the second school , the third school , the fourth school and a junior college.
And so all our schools are English medium schools.
But how wrong it is.
I mean like once I pick up one book I cannot put it down until I finish the whole book.
Shukla Bose : Well , that girl that you saw , her father sells flowers on the roadside.
You know , when we started with our English medium schools we also decided to adopt the best curriculum possible , the ICSE curriculum.
You should just come across to see how well our children do.
Video : SB : We have 80 percent attendance for all our parents-teachers meeting.
Now they have started writing their signature.
Can you teach us ?  "  So , we started an afterschool for our parents , for our mothers.
So , you can imagine how traumatized and how dysfunctional the houses are where our children come from.
We have helped them set up the kitchen and now they are supplying food to all our children.
Vocational skill program for the older siblings so the younger ones are not stopped from coming to school.
Everybody was very friendly , especially I got a lot of friends.
They were very friendly.
Before that I feel like I wasn ' t like this.
And I wouldn ' t want to go to Bangalore . Let me stay here.
And today she wants to be a neurologist.
We ' ve got the best school award for three years successively.
Why is this happening ?  Why this confidence ? 
It is not the infrastructure , not the toilets , not the libraries , but it is what actually happens in this school that is more important.
But we know for sure that what we want to do today is take one child at a time , not get bogged with numbers , and actually see the child complete the circle of life , and unleash his total potential.
This is five-year-old Parusharam.
We have a model by which kids can speak English and understand English in three month ' s time.
And if you ask him what he wants to do , he will say ,  " I want to horsing. " 
When I started Parikrma I began with a great deal of arrogance of transforming the world.
Parusharam is Parikrma with a simple beginning but a long way to go.

And it comes out in January , and I hope you all buy it in triplicate.
And by profession , he ' s a psychophysicist.
And Howard is very interested in measuring things.
We ' d like you to figure out how much aspartame we should put in each can of Diet Pepsi , in order to have the perfect drink. "  Right ? 
Now , if I gave you this problem to do , you would all say , it ' s very simple.
It ' s a mess . It ' s all over the place.
You know , let ' s just make an educated guess , and they simply point and they go for 10 percent , right in the middle.
And he would think it through and say , what was wrong ? 
And that is , that when they analyzed the Diet Pepsi data , they were asking the wrong question.
And Howard immediately went on the road , and he would go to conferences around the country , and he would stand up and he would say ,  " You had been looking for the perfect Pepsi . You ' re wrong.
Tried to get business , nobody would hire him -- he was obsessed , though , and he talked about it and talked about it and talked about it.
And he came back to them and he said ,  " You don ' t just need to improve your regular ; you need to create zesty. " 
Campbell ' s made Prego , and Prego , in the early  ' 80s , was struggling next to Ragu , which was the dominant spaghetti sauce of the  ' 70s and  ' 80s.
You ' d have a plate of spaghetti , and you would pour it on , right ? 
So they came to Howard , and they said , fix us.
Every conceivable way you can vary spaghetti sauce , he varied spaghetti sauce.
Ten small bowls of pasta , with a different spaghetti sauce on each one.
Now , did he look for the most popular brand variety of spaghetti sauce ?  No!
And sure enough , if you sit down , and you analyze all this data on spaghetti sauce , you realize that all Americans fall into one of three groups.
And Prego then went back , and completely reformulated their spaghetti sauce , and came out with a line of extra chunky that immediately and completely took over the spaghetti sauce business in this country.
And today , if you go to the supermarket , a really good one , and you look at how many Ragus there are -- do you know how many they are ?  36!
It is , in fact , enormously important . I ' ll explain to you why.
And for all those years -- 20 , 30 years -- through all those focus group sessions , no one ever said they wanted extra-chunky.
It ' s a mystery!
What do you like ?  Dark , rich , hearty roast!
But you will never , ever say to someone who asks you what you want that  " I want a milky , weak coffee. " 
What were they obsessed with in the early  ' 80s ?  They were obsessed with mustard.
Yellow mustard seeds , turmeric , and paprika . That was mustard.
And instead of charging a dollar-fifty for the eight-ounce bottle , the way that French ' s and Gulden ' s did , they decided to charge four dollars.
And everyone ' s take-home lesson from that was that the way to get to make people happy is to give them something that is more expensive , something to aspire to . Right ? 
And Howard looked to that and said , that ' s wrong!
There is no perfect mustard or imperfect mustard.
Third thing that Howard did , and perhaps the most important , is Howard confronted the notion of the Platonic dish.
They don ' t give you five options on the reduction , right ? 
And she serves it that way time and time again , and if you quarrel with her , she will say ,  " You know what ?  You ' re wrong! This is the best way it ought to be in this restaurant. " 
Italian tomato sauce is what ?  It ' s blended ; it ' s thin.
That ' s what it was . And why were we attached to that ? 
They were looking for one way to treat all of us.
What is the great revolution in science of the last 10 , 15 years ? 
Genetics has opened the door to the study of human variability.
Howard not only believed that , but he took it a second step , which was to say that when we pursue universal principles in food , we aren ' t just making an error ; we are actually doing ourselves a massive disservice.
If , however , you allowed me to break you into coffee clusters , maybe three or four coffee clusters , and I could make coffee just for each of those individual clusters , your scores would go from 60 to 75 or 78.
In this unmissable look at the magic of comics , Scott McCloud bends the presentation format into a cartoon-like experience , where colorful diversions whiz through childhood fascinations and imagined futures that our eyes can hear and touch.
Of the five senses , vision is the one that I appreciate the most , and it ' s the one that I can least take for granted.
They handed out these dark plastic viewers that allowed us to look directly at the sun without damaging our eyes.
What I didn ' t know at the time was that my father had actually been born with perfect eyesight.
So , Dad graduated Harvard in 1946 , married my mom , and bought a house in Lexington , Massachusetts , where the first shots were fired against the British in 1775 , although we didn ' t actually hit any of them until Concord.
But to us he was just Dad , and our home life was pretty normal.
So , here ' s my dad : he ' s a scientist , he ' s an engineer and he ' s a military contractor.
Right , it ' s true.
Now , faith in things which cannot be seen , which cannot be proved , is not the sort of faith that I ' ve ever really related to all that much.
Nobody really understood what it was that he had in mind , except for Ada Lovelace , and he went to his grave trying to pursue that dream.
So did J.C.R . Licklider and his notions for computer-human interaction.
Or even the people who actually pulled it off , who just would sketch out these structures of what would eventually become a worldwide network , and sketching things on the back of napkins and on note papers and arguing over dinner at Howard Johnson ' s -- on Route 128 in Lexington , Massachusetts , just two miles from where I was studying the Queen ' s Gambit Deferred singing  " Midnight Train to Georgia, "  while -- -- in my dad ' s big easy chair , you know ? 
And this third kind of vision , of something which can be , which may be , based on knowledge , but is as yet unproven.
And it ' s that third one , especially , where visions of the future begin to manifest themselves.
Another one which believes in the pure transparency of content.
Interestingly , it seemed to correspond more or less to Jung ' s four subdivisions of human thought.
So -- so this was my nature . The thing was , I saw that the route that I took to discovering this focus in my work and who I was , I saw it as just this road to discovery.
And one of the most important things about comics , I discovered , was that comics are a visual medium , but they try to embrace all of the senses within it.
And if you move to the right you also get language , because that ' s abstracting even further from resemblance , but still maintaining meaning.
Comics is a kind of call and response in which the artist gives you something to see within the panels , and then gives you something to imagine between the panels.
And this temporal map was something that energizes modern comics , but I was wondering if perhaps it also energizes other sorts of forms , and I found some in history.
And within 100 years , you already start to see word balloons and captions , and it ' s really just a hop , skip and a jump from here to here.
So , one of the first things that were proposed was that we could mix the visuals of comics with the sound , motion and interactivity of the CD-ROMs that were being made in those days.
The problem was , that if you go with this idea -- this basic idea that space equals time in comics -- what happens is that when you introduce sound and motion , which are temporal phenomena that can only be represented through time , then they break with that continuity of presentation.
The distance from Abraham Lincoln to a Lincoln penny , the Penny Marshall to the Marshall Plan to  " Plan 9 "  to nine lives : it ' s all the same.
Each of them has a single unbroken reading line , whether it ' s going zigzag across the walls or spiraling up a column or just straight left to right , or even going in a backwards zigzag across those 88 accordion-folded pages.
Now , the monitor is just as limited as the page , technically , right ? 
We could do circular narratives that were literally circular.
So I had all these notions . This was back in the late  ' 90s , and other people in my business thought I was pretty crazy , but a lot of people then went on and actually did it.
What I ' m searching for is a durable mutation -- that ' s what all of us are searching for.
But even though we ' re only experiencing it one piece at a time , that ' s just where the technology is right now.
See what ' s going on here as we draw these stories on an infinite canvas is you ' re creating a more pure expression of what this medium is all about.
Just one more.
I think this is important because media , all media , provide us a window back into our world.
And when media evolve so that the identity of the media becomes increasingly unique.
One of many reasons , but I ' ve got to go now.

When I arrived off the plane , after a very long journey from the West of England , my computer , my beloved laptop , had gone mad , and had -- oh! -- a bit like that! -- and the display on it -- anyway , the whole thing had burst.
Anyway , so you ' re in for a treat , because he ' s fantastic , and his name ' s Mark.
http://www.ted.com/talks/chris_bliss_comedy_is_translation.html
Chris Bliss : Comedy is translation
Now I was a comparative literature major in college , which is like an English major , only instead of being stuck studying Chaucer for three months , we got to read great literature in translation from around the world.
It ' s called apropos of the Italian adage that I lifted from his forward ,  " If This Be Treason. " 
Now maybe that ' s been obvious to all of you for a long time , but for me , as often as I ' d encountered that exact difficulty on a daily basis , I had never seen the inherent challenge of communication in so crystalline a light.
It ' s funny , my wife , Daisy , whose family is littered with schizophrenics -- and I mean littered with them -- once said to me ,  " Chris , I already have a brother who thinks he ' s God.
Interestingly , when your opening line of communication is ,  " Hey , listen up , because I ' m about to drop some serious knowledge on you, "  it ' s amazing how quickly you ' ll discover both ice and the firing squad.
If I had to place it on an arbitrary spectrum , I ' d say it falls somewhere between poetry and lies.
Because that ' s what I take from the theme of this conference : Gained in Translation.
It ' s part of our survival package , and that ' s why it ' s become so important for us , and that ' s why we ' re always listening at that level.
Fey demonstrated far more effectively than any political pundit the candidate ' s fundamental lack of seriousness , cementing an impression that the majority of the American public still holds today.
Now that ' s honesty and integrity , and it ' s also why Fey ' s performances left such a lasting impression.
And guess what ? 
Now whether this says more about the conflict between integrity and profitability of corporate journalism than it does about the attentiveness of Stewart ' s viewers , the larger point remains that Stewart ' s material is always grounded in a commitment to the facts -- not because his intent is to inform . It ' s not.
Now this is doubly ironic when you consider that what gives comedy its edge at reaching around people ' s walls is the way that it uses deliberate misdirection.
This is the exact opposite of the way that anger and fear and panic , all of the flight-or-fight responses , operate.
I have some material about the so-called radical gay agenda , which starts off by asking , how radical is the gay agenda ? 
And that ' s followed by these lines about gay adoption : What is the problem with gay adoption ? 
Remove it from your household.
There are few phrases that pack a more concentrated dose of subject and symbol than the perfect punchline.
And one last powerful attribute that comedy has as communication is that it ' s inherently viral.
Back in 1980 when comedian Richard Pryor accidentally set himself on fire during a freebasing accident , I was in Los Angeles the day after it happened and then I was in Washington D.C . two days after that.
First there were drums and then knock-knock jokes.
I was visiting with Joel the weekend before the Copenhagen conference on climate change opened in December of 2009.
Because first of all , there ' s this false premise that such a thing as complete science exists.
But back in 2009 , the question Joel and I kept turning over and over was why this late in the game so much energy was being spent talking about the science when the policies necessary to address climate change were unequivocally beneficial for humanity in the long run regardless of the science.
How about that ?  How about we create a better world for nothing ? 
And not long after that , he got another request for a copy from the head of the EPA in California who used it as part of her presentation at an international conference on climate change in Sacramento last year.
That is a lot of punch for 14 words.
culture,global issues,history,language,physics
In fact , mostly now in other things.
They don ' t like that . They think it ' s crank . I don ' t think it ' s crank.
How far back does that go ?  How far back does modern language go ? 
I can ' t believe they did all those things and didn ' t also have a modern language.
You may just know more about everything than anyone.
art,arts,design,entertainment,happiness
And I play when I design.
And I think that if you ' re not , there ' s probably something inherently wrong with the structure or the situation you ' re in , if you ' re a designer.
He ' s a wonderful humorist . And I ' m going to read you this essay , or an excerpt from it because it really hit home for me.
Being solemn is easy.
In politics , the rare candidate who is serious , like Adlai Stevenson , is easily overwhelmed by one who is solemn , like Eisenhower.
Washington , D.C . is solemn.
Now , when I apply Russell Baker ' s definition of solemnity or seriousness to design , it doesn ' t necessarily make any particular point about quality.
Serious design , serious play , is something else.
Serious design is imperfect.
Perfection happens during solemn play.
That ' s because you don ' t know anything and you have a lot to learn , and so that anything you do is a learning experience and you ' re just jumping right up there.
I ' m hired to be solemn , but I find more and more that I ' m solemn when I don ' t have to be.
Now , when I was in my early 20s , I worked in the record business , designing record covers for CBS Records , and I had no idea what a great job I had.
I thought the typeface Helvetica was the cleanest , most boring , most fascistic , really repressive typeface , and I hated everything that was designed in Helvetica.
So -- so , my goal in life was to do stuff that wasn ' t made out of Helvetica.
You had to go places and find the stuff.
I mixed up Victorian designs with pop , and I mixed up Art Nouveau with something else.
And there ' s something wonderful about that form of youth , where you can let yourself grow and play , and be really a brat , and then accomplish things.
And first I was praised for it , then criticized for it , but the fact of the matter was , I had become solemn.
There ' s a Paul Newman movie that I love called  " The Verdict. " 
And in the depth of despair , in the midst of the movie , when it looks like he can ' t pull this thing off , and he needs this case , he needs to win this case so badly.
And that is a wonderful position to be in to create some serious play.
This is what was in the newspapers and in the New York Times.
And George Wolf had taken over from another director and he wanted to change the theater , and he wanted to make it urban and loud and a place that was inclusive.
There was no in-house department that these things were pushed to.
It enabled me to really express myself and grow.
I ' m on their board , and I still am involved with it.
And what happened was that New York City , to a degree , ate my identity because people began to copy it.
Now -- and I think since the Public Theater , I must have done more than a dozen cultural identities for major institutions , and I don ' t think I ever -- I ever grasped that seriousness again -- I do them for very big , important institutions in New York City.
That doesn ' t happen very often , but it happened to me in the year 2000 , when for some reason or another , a whole pile of different architects started to ask me to design the insides of theaters with them , where I would take environmental graphics and work them into buildings.
I said ,  " Why can ' t the signage be on the floor ?  " 
They ran around corners , they went up sides of buildings , and they melded into the architecture.
This is the children ' s museum in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , made out of completely inexpensive materials.
Donors '  walls made out of Lucite.
This is the building that -- they had no money , and they had to recast it , and they said , if we give you 100,000 dollars , what can you do with it ? 
I hired guys who paint flats fixed on the sides of garages to do the painting on the building , and they loved it.
By the time I did Bloomberg ' s headquarters my work had begun to become accepted.
But it became the end of the seriousness of the play , and it started to , once again , become solemn.
A neighborhood has a thing -- it ' s got a landmark , it ' s got a place , it ' s got a restaurant . It doesn ' t have a logo . I mean , what would that be ? 
But I was so utterly unqualified for this project , and so utterly ridiculous , and ignored the brief so desperately that I think they just embraced it with wholeheartedness , just completely because it was so goofy to begin with.
And I actually am amused by them and like them , and think that as a very , very , very , very , very big corporation they actually keep their graphics very nice.
I thought I was going to go crazy at the end of this year.
So during this time I needed some kind of counterbalance for this crazy , crazy existence of going to these long , idiotic meetings.
Every single city of the United States is on here.
One of my favorites was this painting I did of Florida after the 2000 election that has the election results rolling around in the water.
And they sold quickly , and became rather popular.
We began doing these big silkscreen prints , and they started selling , too.
I was actually in this solemn landscape of fulfilling an expectation for a show , which is not where I started with these things.
So , I ' m plugging along here -- and I ' m just going to have to blow up the staircase.

And it ' s a lively and a lovely place , but we ' re rapidly changing the oceans with our -- not only with our overfishing , our irresponsible fishing , our adding of pollutants like fertilizer from our cropland , but also , most recently , with climate change , and Steve Schneider , I ' m sure , will be going into greater detail on this.
About 100 grams of jellyfish equals four calories.
And that predator is the giant ocean sunfish , the Mola mola , whose primary prey are jellyfish.
So it ' s kind of nice , the sun and the moon getting together this way , even if one is eating the other.
Their other name , Mola mola , is -- it sounds Hawaiian , but it ' s actually Latin for millstone , and that ' s attributable to their roundish , very bizarre , cut-off shape.
And this is just so elegantly mysterious , it ' s just -- it really kind of holds its cards a lot tighter than say , a tuna.
They appeared shortly after the dinosaurs disappeared , 65 million years ago , at a time when whales still had legs , and they come from a rebellious little puffer fish faction -- oblige me a little Kipling-esque storytelling here.
They look -- maybe they look kind of prehistoric and unfinished , abridged perhaps , but in fact , in fact they are the -- they vie for the top position of the most evolutionarily-derived fish in the sea , right up there with flat fish.
A single four-foot female had 300 million eggs , can carry 300 million eggs in her ovaries -- imagine -- and they get to be over 10 feet long . Imagine what a 10 foot one has.
They ' re in  " The Guinness World Book of Records "  again for being the vertebrate growth champion of the world.
Now I don ' t know how you ' d feed a child like that but -- we don ' t know how fast the Molas grow in the wild , but captive growth studies at the Monterey Bay Aquarium -- one of the first places to have them in captivity -- they had one that gained 800 lbs in 14 months.
If we ' re going to save the world from total jellyfish domination , then we ' ve got to figure out what the jellyfish predators -- how they live their lives , like the Mola.
And how do you do that ? 
How do you seduce an open ocean creature like that to spill its secrets ? 
And it can record this data for up to two years , and keep it in that tag , release at a pre-programmed time , float to the surface , upload all that data , that whole travelogue , to satellite , which relays it directly to our computers , and we ' ve got that whole dataset . And we didn ' t even have -- we just had to tag the animal and then we went home and you know , sat at our desks.
They ' re just parasite hotels ; even their parasites have parasites.
They don ' t seem to mind , so far.
We ' d love to tag in Monterey.
The California sea lion takes the Molas as soon as they come into the bay , rips off their fins , fashions them into the ultimate Frisbee , Mola style , and then tosses them back and forth.
Not so many California sea lions down there.
And they come and give the Molas -- you can see they strike this funny little position that says ,  " I ' m not threatening , but I need a massage. " 
You truly can swim up to a Mola -- they ' re very gentle -- and if you approach them right , you can give them a scratch and they enjoy it.
We were served a nine-course meal of Mola after we tagged.
And you ' re just wondering , oh , I hope the fish is safe , I hope , I hope it ' s going to be able to actually live its life out during the course that the tag is recording.
And it hasn ' t been published , so it ' s totally privy information just for TED.
They ' re not big migrators . This is their track : we deployed the tag off of Tokyo , and the Mola in one month kind of got into the Kuroshio Current off of Japan and foraged there.
So that ' s a very important piece of data.
As the sun comes up , you see in the blue , they start their dive.
And they ' re hitting a layer down there ; it ' s called the deep scattering layer -- which a whole variety of food ' s in that layer.
And what ' s exciting -- you all travel , and you know the best thing about traveling is to be able to find the locals , and to find the great places by getting the local knowledge.
I set up a website because I was getting so many questions about Molas and sunfish.
I was getting reports from Catholic nuns , Jewish Rabbis , Muslims , Christians -- everybody writing in , united by their love of life.

And today , 45 years later , we clearly have no less need for this kind of clarity and perspective , but what we do have is improved technology.
Most importantly for this , they ' re faster.
The equator ' s speed is actually about 60 miles per hour.
In addition to higher resolution versions of this display , my father and I are working on a new patent-pending design for a fully volumetric display using the same phenomenon.
And so you could see that as this disc rotates about this axis , it will create a disc of light that we can control.
Now this piece is currently in process -- due out in May -- but what we ' ve done is we ' ve put together a small demo , just to show the geometric translation of points into a sphere.
And here you can see it ' s rotating about the vertical axis only , creating circles.
It ' ll be on display at the Interactive Telecommunications Spring Show in Greenwich Village in New York City -- that ' s open to the public , definitely invite you all to come and attend -- it ' s a fantastic show.
It ' s an honor to be here . Thanks very much.

Mallika Sarabhai : Dance to change the world
She was the wife of an even more famous Brahmin.
Indra saw the woman , a Sekhri.
Then Indra disappeared.
So , the god Vishnu arrived.
Vishnu gave his judgment.
And so it transpired that a horse was killed , a god was made sin-free , a Brahmin ' s ego was appeased , a woman .. . was ruined , and a one-eyed monkey was left ...
That ' s a lot of women who don ' t get justice.
If you ' re in Australia , it ' s mostly aboriginals who are in jail.
And the Brahmins and the gods , like in my story , always get to tell their truth as The Truth.
Now , if I were to go into the same crowd and say ,  " I want to lecture you about justice and injustice, "  they would say ,  " Thank you very much , we have other things to do. " 
No . It breaks through those.
And Mr . Berlusconi knows it , as he sits atop this huge empire of media and television and so on and so forth.
It was a phenomenon where young brides were committing suicide in rural Gujarat , because they were being forced to bring more and more money for their in-laws '  families.
Imagine a dance piece for the first inquiry into something that even today kills thousands of women.
And then aboriginal women in Africa would come and say ,  " This is it! " 
And that ' s because there is no clean water to drink , or in countries like India , people don ' t know that they need to soap their hands before defecation.
They try and build it . They try and build pipelines ; it doesn ' t happen.
And it was a simple idea . It was an idea that could not profit anybody but would help health in every field.
Why isn ' t it on every poster across the third world ? 
And here is one of the ways we get it to people.
Woman : What solution ? 
Woman : Here father . Woman : Yes , of course.
Man : One , two , three , four folds we make.
Our drinking water safe we make.
I think it ' s safe to say that all of us here are deeply concerned about the escalating violence in our daily lives.
Well , here is one such way.
So much peace in one place ? 
One little gene in you has been trying to get through ? 
It ' s the feeling that wells up from deep inside , when your husband comes home drunk and you wanna tan his hide.
Too small for detection , it ' s your built-in protection.
Cause you ' re either a victim , or on top , like me.
Hello , gangs from this neighborhood killing gangs from that neighborhood.
look what they ' ve done.
And when , onscreen , Crystal got breast cancer , 75,000 more young women went to have mammographies done.
What I need to say to the planners of the world , the governments , the strategists is ,  " You have treated the arts as the cherry on the cake.
So , what is it that we require ?  What is it that we need ? 
There are more people dying of simple things.
Her father the king said ,  " Don ' t whistle. " 
Her father the king said ,  " Who will marry a whistling princess ?  " 
He invited all the princes to come and defeat his daughter at whistling.
Some whistled well.
But the princess said ,  " Father , Mother , don ' t worry.
And they said ,  " Me ?  Defeated by a woman ? 
 " Father , mother , this man shall be my wife. "

So it didn ' t happen . It was a dream that did not happen.
And it was a technology that was inevitable.
It ' s the universe in which these machines are now doing all these things , including changing biology.
So , he wasn ' t only thinking about them ; he built one . This is the machine he built.
Leibniz , who came a little bit later -- this is 1679 -- showed that you didn ' t even need subtraction.
He talked about doing it with marbles , having gates and what we now call shift registers , where you shift the gates , drop the marbles down the tracks.
So June 1945 -- actually , the bomb hasn ' t even been dropped yet -- and Von Neumann is putting together all the theory to actually build this thing , which also goes back to Turing , who , before that , gave the idea that you could do all this with a very brainless , little , finite state machine , just reading a tape in and reading a tape out.
And that ' s really the simplest computer.
The instructions which govern this operation must be given in absolutely exhaustive detail.
Such a computer would open up universes , which are , at the present , outside the range of any instruments.
But the first meetings , November 1945 , were at RCA ' s offices.
When RCA said no , that ' s when they decided to build it in Princeton , where Freeman works at the Institute.
And this is Von Neumann and Morgenstern , who wrote the  " Theory of Games. " 
And Julian Bigelow , who took Zworkykin ' s place as the engineer , to actually figure out , using electronics , how you would build this thing . The whole gang of people who came to work on this , and women in front , who actually did most of the coding , were the first programmers.
You can read the text.
And we take it for granted now , that each of these machines has billions of transistors , doing billions of cycles per second without failing.
Reports were issued , so that this machine was cloned at 15 other places around the world.
So , there ' s 40 of these tubes , like a V-40 engine running the memory.
Then they switched to a magnetic drum.
So , Von Neumann was already off in a theoretical cloud , doing abstract sorts of studies of how you could build reliable machines out of unreliable components.
This includes a large amount of human error.
He had to focus the memory -- seems OK.
So , already , they ' re complaining about the manuals :  " before closing down in disgust .. .  "   " The General Arithmetic : Operating Logs. " 
 " Aha! "  So , they figured out it ' s a code problem.
 " And the dawn came. "  So they ran all night.
 " Something ' s wrong with the air conditioner -- smell of burning V-belts in the air. " 
Here ,  " A mouse has climbed into the blower behind the regulator rack , set blower to vibrating . Result : no more mouse. " 
 " Picked a lightning bug off the drum. "   " Running at two kilocycles. " 
 " I have now duplicated both results.
 " We ' ve duplicated errors before. " 
 " Machine a thing of beauty , and a joy forever. "   " Perfect running. " 
So , that was the result . It was Mike , the first thermonuclear bomb , in 1952.
He ' s still ahead of some of the stuff that ' s being done now.
And he saw everything in terms of -- he could read the binary code straight off the machine.
 " Dr . Barricelli claims machine is wrong , code is right. " 
And he published it . It wasn ' t locked up and disappeared.
And he found all these , sort of -- it was like a naturalist coming in and looking at this tiny , 5,000-byte universe , and seeing all these things happening that we see in the outside world , in biology.
You have a genotype and you have to have a phenotype.
Every time there was a new , fast machine , he started using it , and saw exactly what ' s happening now.
And he went out of his way to say that he was not saying this was lifelike , or a new kind of life.
So , when I went into these archives looking at this stuff , lo and behold , the archivist came up one day , saying ,  " I think we found another box that had been thrown out. " 
 " There must be something about this code that you haven ' t explained yet. " 
And the question is , should we run them or not ? 
My laptop is 10 thousand million times the size of the universe that they lived in when Barricelli quit the project.
We ' ve been doing that since , you know , since we started PCR and synthesizing small strings of DNA.
It took really three people : Barricelli had the concept of the code as a living thing ; Von Neumann saw how you could build the machines -- that now , last count , four million of these Von Neumann machines is built every 24 hours ; and Julian Bigelow , who died 10 days ago -- this is John Markoff ' s obituary for him -- he was the important missing link , the engineer who came in and knew how to put those vacuum tubes together and make it work.
That ' s the last entry in the logbook when the machine was shut down , July 1958.
Despite multibillion-dollar investments in cybersecurity , one of its root problems has been largely ignored : who are the people who write malicious code ?  Underworld investigator Misha Glenny profiles several convicted coders from around the world and reaches a startling conclusion.
Now this is a very un-TED-like thing to do , but let ' s kick off the afternoon with a message from a mystery sponsor.
We do not forgive . We do not forget.
You never know when they ' re going to attack next , who or what the consequences will be.
 " What do we do now ? 
Sometimes you turn on the news and you say ,  " Is there anyone left to hack ?  " 
Is nothing sacred anymore , for heaven ' s sake ? 
They say that governments are trying to take over the Internet and control it , and that they , Anonymous , are the authentic voice of resistance -- be it against Middle Eastern dictatorships , against global media corporations , or against intelligence agencies , or whoever it is.
But one thing is true : we are at the beginning of a mighty struggle for control of the Internet.
And unfortunately , for mortals like you and me , we probably can ' t understand it very well.
But in order to try and explain the whole thing , I would need another 18 minutes or so to do it , so you ' re just going to have to take it on trust from me on this occasion , and let me assure you that all of these issues are involved in cybersecurity and control of the Internet one way or the other , but in a configuration that even Stephen Hawking would probably have difficulty trying to get his head around.
And so I thought to myself ,  " Well , these are the guys who I want to talk to. " 
Instead , we prefer these really dazzling technological solutions , which cost a huge amount of money.
But because they ' re a U.N . operation , maybe that ' s why governments and corporations are not that interested in them.
Now , so far I ' ve mentioned the hackers Anonymous who are a politically motivated hacking group.
Well real organized crime on the Internet goes back about 10 years when a group of gifted Ukrainian hackers developed a website , which led to the industrialization of cybercrime.
Cybercriminals would go there to buy and sell stolen credit card details , to exchange information about new malware that was out there.
And its creators were incredibly smart and entrepreneurial , because they were faced with one enormous challenge as cybercriminals.
They appointed an officer who would mediate between the vendor and the purchaser.
And if they did , he then passed on the money to the vendor and the stolen credit card details to the purchaser.
Now I spoke to one of these Carders who we ' ll call RedBrigade -- although that wasn ' t even his proper nickname -- but I promised I wouldn ' t reveal who he was.
But that ' s a slightly different story , which I won ' t go into now.
And this is because hackers are only one element in a cybercriminal enterprise.
Now he developed his social and moral compass on the Black Sea port during the 1990s.
You have to understand though that from his ninth birthday , the only environment he knew was gangsterism.
At 11 , he was interrogated by the Sri Lankan military , accused of being a terrorist , and his parents sent him on his own to Britain as a refugee seeking political asylum.
Born in Southern Germany to a stable and well-respected middle class family , his obsession with gaming as a teenager led him to hacking.
Max Vision , aka ICEMAN -- mastermind of cardersMarket.
But also , because he was an inveterate hacker , he left a tiny digital wormhole through which he alone could crawl.
Adewale Taiwo , aka FeddyBB -- master bank account cracker from Abuja in Nigeria.
He combined the tremendous skills of a geek with the suave social engineering skills of the master criminal.
They are all people who learned their hacking skills in their early to mid-teens.
And the other thing is the high incidence of hackers like these who have characteristics which are consistent with Asperger ' s syndrome.
Now I think we ' re missing a trick here , because I don ' t think people like Max Vision should be in jail.
We need to engage and find ways of offering guidance to these young people , because they are a remarkable breed.
How would someone get over that kind of fear that the hacker they hire might preserve that little teensy wormhole ? 
We just never knew how to get there , what we were doing.
Sharing powerful stories from his anti-obesity project in Huntington , W . Va. , TED Prize winner Jamie Oliver makes the case for an all-out assault on our ignorance of food.
Sadly , in the next 18 minutes when I do our chat , four Americans that are alive will be dead from the food that they eat.
I use information , education.
This is one of the most unhealthy countries in the world.
Most of you . OK.
You lot , you ' re all right , but we ' ll get you eventually , don ' t worry.
Look at homicide at the bottom , for God ' s sake.
Fact : Diet-related disease is the biggest killer in the United States , right now , here today.
England is right behind you , as usual.
Think about smoking.
And let ' s be honest , guys , you ain ' t got that cash.
I ' ve been doing this for seven years.
I went to West Virginia , the most unhealthy state in America.
Beautiful town.
She ' s 16 years old.
She ' s eating her liver to death.
The family ' s obese.
She ' s obese before she even gets to primary school.
Pastor Steve : an inspirational man , one of my early allies in Huntington , West Virginia.
Come winter , three times as many people die.
We ' re not geared up to do this.
I need you to understand it.
Let ' s start with the Main Street.
Big companies . Big companies.
Labeling is a massive problem.
What , in this kind of climate ?  They don ' t deserve it.
That ain ' t happening anymore.
Jamie Oliver : Let ' s have a talk.
Stacy : Just feeling really sad and depressed right now.
But we can stop that.
School was always invented to arm us with the tools to make us creative , do wonderful things , make us earn a living , etc. , etc. , etc.
School food is something that most kids -- 31 million a day , actually -- have twice a day , more than often , breakfast and lunch , 180 days of the year.
The lunch ladies , the lunch cooks of America -- I offer myself as their ambassador.
But they ' re doing what they ' re told , and what they ' re being told to do is wrong.
Now , the reality is , the food that your kids get every day is fast food , it ' s highly processed , there ' s not enough fresh food in there at all.
They have scissors in the classroom , but knives and forks ?  No.
We ' re not teaching our kids.
Video : Who knows what this is ? 
JO : What about this ?  Our good old friend.
Video : JO : Who knows what that is ?  Child : Uh , pear ? 
Guess what fixed that . Guess what fixed that : Two one-hour sessions.
Every kid has the right to milk at school.
But milk ain ' t good enough anymore.
Do you know what I mean ? 
It ' s in everything . Even the milk hasn ' t escaped the kind of modern-day problems.
We ' ve got one kid , here , having , you know , eight tablespoons of sugar a day.
Now , I don ' t know about you guys , but judging the circumstances , right , any judge in the whole world , would look at the statistics and the evidence , and they would find any government of old guilty of child abuse . That ' s my belief.
So , let ' s just think about , we got a problem here , we need to reboot.
So , supermarkets.
Love them . They just sell us what we want . All right.
It is done in some , and it needs to be done across the board in America soon , and quick.
Fast food . With the fast-food industry you know , it ' s very competitive.
So , these guys are going to be part of the solution.
There needs to be a new standard of fresh , proper food for your children . Yeah ? 
If you can cook , time doesn ' t matter.
Marissa , her father died in her hand , I think she ' d be quite happy if corporate America could start feeding their staff properly.
Absolutely.
Romantic , yes , but most importantly , it ' s about trying to get people to realize that every one of your individual efforts makes a difference.
Huntington ' s Kitchen . I work with a community.
This can do 5,000 people a year , which is 10 percent of their population , and it ' s people on people.
Around America , if we just look back now , there is plenty of wonderful things going on.
Businesses of America need to support Mrs . Obama to do the things that she wants to do.
When I was in Huntington , trying to get a few things to work when they weren ' t , I thought  " If I had a magic wand , what would I do ?  "  And I thought ,  " You know what ? 
So , my wish.

Eve Ensler : happiness in body and soul
I was worried about my own vagina.
In the first place , it ' s not so easy to even find your vagina.
 " You ' ve got to get down there on your back , in front of a mirror , full-length preferred . You ' ve got to get in the perfect position , with the perfect light , which then becomes shadowed by the angle you ' re at.
They began as casual vagina interviews , and they turned into vagina monologues.
Women love to talk about their vaginas -- they do.
 " Hurry , nurse , bring the vagina. " 
I ' m worried what we call them and don ' t call them.
In Westchester they call it a  " pooky, "  in New Jersey a  " twat. " 
This is how the  " Vagina Monologues "  begins.
And so I said to a friend casually ,  " Well , what do you think about your vagina ?  " 
But I want to talk a little bit about happiness and the relationship to this whole vagina journey because it has been an extraordinary journey that began eight years ago.
And what happened through the course of the  " Vagina Monologues "  and this journey is I think I have come to understand a little bit more about happiness.
And that ' s where the deepest happiness has actually come from.
And I started this piece , particularly with stories and narratives , and I was talking to one woman and that led to another woman and that led to another woman , and then I wrote those stories down and I put them out in front of other people.
What women lined up to tell me was how they were raped , and how they were battered , and how they were beaten , and how they were gang-raped in parking lots , and how they were incested by their uncles.
And it turned out , after thinking and investigating , that I discovered -- and the UN has actually said this recently -- that one out of every three women on this planet will be beaten or raped in her lifetime.
And within five years , this extraordinary thing began to happen.
What I have learned is two things . One : that the epidemic of violence towards women is shocking ; it ' s global ; it is so profound and it is so devastating , and it is so in every little pocket of every little crater , of every little society , that we don ' t even recognize it because it ' s become ordinary . This journey has taken me to Afghanistan , where I had the extraordinary honor and privilege to go into parts of Afghanistan under the Taliban -- I was dressed in a burqa -- and I went in with an extraordinary group called the Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan , and I saw firsthand how women had been stripped of every single right that was possible to strip women of -- from being educated , to being employed , to being actually allowed to eat ice cream.
And women lifted their burqas and ate this ice cream , and I don ' t think I ever understood pleasure until that moment , and how women have found a way to keep their pleasure alive.
I have seen terrible , terrible , terrible violence.
What has also happened is in the course of these travels -- and it ' s been an extraordinary thing -- is that every single place that I have gone to in the world , I have met a new species.
But every single country I have been to -- and in the last six years I ' ve been to about 45 countries , and many tiny little villages and cities and towns -- I have seen something what I ' ve come to call  " vagina warriors. " 
And this is a very heady place.
I want to talk about three particular people that I ' ve met , vagina warriors , who really transformed my understanding of this whole principle and species , and one is a woman named Marsha Lopez.
And at that time we did this extraordinary V-Day at Madison Square Garden where we sold out the entire testosterone-filled dome , 18,000 people standing up to say  " yes "  to vaginas , which was really a pretty incredible transformation.
I was beaten by my husband for five years.
She went to Juarez to take care of an ailing aunt , and over the course of it , she began to discover what was happening to the murdered and disappeared women of Juarez.
She began to document it ; she opened a center called Casa Amiga ; and in six years , she has literally brought this to the consciousness of the world.
So when she got older she created this incredible thing : it ' s an anatomical sculpture of a woman ' s body ; it ' s half a woman ' s body.
And she said ,  " Well , if you got me a Jeep , I could get around a lot faster. " 
And everyone was supposed to be happy in that community and , in fact , my life was hell . I lived with an alcoholic father who beat me and molested me , and it was all inside that.
Now , Mr . Alligator never did come , but the idea of Mr . Alligator coming actually saved my sanity and made it OK for me to keep going because I believed , in the distance , there would be someone coming to rescue me.
And in the Masai community , goats and cows are the most valued possession.
And it was a gorgeous day in the African sun , and the dust was flying and the girls were dancing , and there was this house , and it said ,  " V-Day Safe House for the Girls. " 
And I feel that knowledge and that journey has been an extraordinary privilege , and I feel really blessed to have been here today to communicate that to you.

I said somebody here must surely know , because despite the fact that there aren ' t that many Hungarians to begin with , and the further fact that , so far as I know , there ' s not a drop of Hungarian blood in my veins , at every critical juncture of my life there has been a Hungarian friend or mentor there beside me.
And as a consequence of that presumption , my hometown was burned to the ground by an invading army , an experience that has befallen many a Hungarian town and village throughout its long and troubled history.
Well , it seems to me that this Hungarian presence in my life is difficult to account for , but ultimately I ascribe it to an admiration for people with a complex moral awareness , with a heritage of guilt and defeat matched by defiance and bravado.
Never mind the fact that they were slow to acknowledge they needed saving.
He was a puckish widower whose wife and children were dead and whose grandchildren lived far away.
He went to the commercial business high school as a young man in Budapest , and there he was as smart as he was modest and he enjoyed a considerable success . And after graduation when he went into textile engineering , the success continued.
The night watchman had caught an employee who was stealing socks -- it was a hosiery mill , and he simply backed a truck up to the loading dock and was shoveling in mountains of socks.
He will not steal from us again. " 
In those early days of the Final Solution , it was handcrafted brutality ; people were beaten to death and their bodies tossed into the river.
And the Gauleiter , who afterwards vanishes from this story , leaned down and whispered into Mr . Teszler ' s ear ,  " No , do not take the capsule . Help is on the way. " 
Probably , Mr . Teszler had gotten some money into Swiss bank accounts because he managed to take his family first to Great Britain , then to Long Island and then to the center of the textile industry in the American South.
And he called his top assistant to him and asked ,  " Where would you say , in this region , racism is most virulent ?  " 
Now , you should know that at that time , the textile industry in the South was notoriously segregated.
He got the same answer :  " You bring the best workers that you can find , and if they are good enough , I will hire them. " 
He had installed the heavy equipment for his new process in an abandoned store in the vicinity of Kings Mountain , and for two months these 16 men would live and work together , mastering the new process.
 " No , I reckon I don ' t. " 
Do you have any other questions ?  " 
To me , it was immensely reassuring that the presiding spirit of this little Methodist college in upstate South Carolina was a Holocaust survivor from Central Europe.
But it was music that was his greatest passion , especially opera.
And it was at his house that I heard for the first time Bartok ' s Third Piano Concerto and learned from Mr . Teszler that it had been composed in nearby Asheville , North Carolina in the last year of the composer ' s life.
And just as clearly , it is saying ,  " It ' s okay . It was all so beautiful.
I delivered a lecture in which I described history as , on the whole , a tidal wave of human suffering and brutality , and Mr . Teszler came up to me afterwards with gentle reproach and said ,  " You know , Doctor , human beings are fundamentally good. " 
I thought my skein of Hungarian mentors had come to an end , but almost immediately I met Francis Robicsek , a Hungarian doctor -- actually a heart surgeon in Charlotte , North Carolina , then in his late seventies -- who had been a pioneer in open-heart surgery , and , tinkering away in his garage behind his house , had invented many of the devices that are standard parts of those procedures.
On the occasion of my first visit , we toured his house and we saw hundreds of works of museum quality , and then we paused in front of a closed door and Dr . Robicsek said , with obvious pride ,  " Now for the piece de resistance. " 
They would not leave me alone until I let them have a piece , but it was not a good one. " 
And afterwards we convened at the President ' s House with Dr . Robicsek on one hand , Mr . Milliken on the other.
They got along famously until the very end of the meal , and then they got into a furious argument.
And Dr . Robicsek reeled back in his chair , but quickly gathered his wits , leaned forward and said ,  " Well , that is true , but I ' ll bet you went to the movie with a grandchild. "   " Well , yes , I did, "  conceded Mr . Milliken.
 " Live each day as if it is your last, "  said Mahatma Gandhi.
This defines the imagined futures of our fellow Hungarians -- Robicsek , Teszler and Bartok -- as it does my own.

Ellen Dunham-Jones : Retrofitting suburbia
And in the process , what that allows us to do is to redirect a lot more of our growth back into existing communities that could use a boost , and have the infrastructure in place , instead of continuing to tear down trees and to tear up the green space out at the edges.
has about one-third the carbon footprint of the average suburban dweller , mostly because suburbanites drive a lot more , and living in detached buildings , you have that much more exterior surface to leak energy out of.
It ' s increased our dependence on foreign oil despite the gains in fuel efficiency.
And those have been linked then with the rather alarming , growing rates of obesity , shown in these maps here , and that obesity has also been triggering great increases in heart disease and diabetes to the point where a child born today has a one-in-three chance of developing diabetes.
Suburban expansion to cheap land , for the last 50 years -- you know the cheap land out on the edge -- has helped generations of families enjoy the American dream.
That ' s before we got up to the four bucks a gallon.
I think it is.
Since 2000 , already two-thirds of households in suburbia did not have kids in them.
They ' re the other big generation.
The other big dynamic of change is the sheer performance of underperforming asphalt.
It no longer just makes sense.
It turns out , all sorts of things.
It ' s not pulling in as much tax revenue as it once was , but it ' s serving its community.
We also found a lot of examples of dead big-box stores that have been converted into all sorts of community-serving uses as well -- lots of schools , lots of churches and lots of libraries like this one.
This one is a little L-shaped strip shopping center in Phoenix , Arizona.
The real estate ads in the neighborhood all very proudly proclaim ,  " Walking distance to Le Grande Orange, "  because it provided its neighborhood with what sociologists like to call  " a third place. " 
Now , during the boom , there were several really dramatic redevelopment projects where the original building was scraped to the ground and then the whole site was rebuilt at significantly greater density , a sort of compact , walkable urban neighborhoods.
So the black and white photo shows the simple 60 ' s strip shopping center.
This is another infill project on the parking lots , this one of an office park outside of Washington D.C.
Today , the transit , the Main Street and the new housing have all been built.
So here ' s what it looks like.
There ' s massive P.V . arrays on the roofs as well as wind turbines.
They had their prom in the mall . They loved their mall.
The department stores are multistory ; they ' re better built.
So here it is at projected build-out.
Here ' s what the new Main Street looks like.
And so it ' s giving people more choices , but it ' s not taking away choices.
So this is one that has been retrofitted in California.
I could imagine beautiful housing going up along there without tearing down another tree.
There ' s a lot to learn from successful landbanking programs in cities like Flint , Michigan.
So they ' ve managed to both restore the local ecology and the local economy at the same time.
And the wavy line is a path alongside a creek that has now been daylit.
What ' s next ? 
Where should we be redeveloping ? 
And we chose to try to reverse sprawl through three simple moves -- expensive , but simple.
In a hundred years , subdivisions that simply end up too close to water or too far from transit won ' t be viable.
Now , retrofits are often accused of being examples of faux downtowns and instant urbanism , and not without reason ; you don ' t get much more phony than an Astroturf town green.
Their populations are more diverse than typical suburbia , but they ' re less diverse than cities.
The fact that a protest is happening really does mean that the layout of the blocks , the streets and blocks , the putting in of public space , compromised as it may be , is still a really great thing.
But culturally , we tend to think that downtowns should be dynamic , and we expect that.
As the director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York , Thomas P . Campbell thinks deeply about curating—not just selecting art objects , but placing them in a setting where the public can learn their stories . With glorious images , he shows how his curation philosophy works for displaying medieval tapestries—and for the over-the-top fashion/art of Alexander McQueen.
When I was considering a career in the art world , I took a course in London , and one of my supervisors was this irascible Italian called Pietro , who drank too much , smoked too much and swore much too much.
He said ,  " It ' s a what ?  " 
I said ,  " It ' s a Bacchanal by Titian. " 
There was an important lesson for me in that.
How is it used ? 
Tapestries were ubiquitous between the Middle Ages and , really , well into the 18th century , and it was pretty apparent why.
So , all in all , in an age when the visual image of any kind was rare , tapestries were an incredibly potent form of propaganda.
It wasn ' t straightforward . It ' s no longer a question of chucking a tapestry in the back of a car.
You know , we live in an age where we are so used to television images and photographs , a one-hit image . These were big , complex things , almost like cartoons with multiple narratives.
The exhibition was designed to be an experience , and tapestries are hard to reproduce in photographs.
But it brought it alive to them . I think they suddenly saw that these weren ' t just old faded tapestries.
A few years later , I was invited to be the director of the museum , and after I got over that --  " Who , me ?  The tapestry geek ?  I don ' t wear a tie! "  -- I realized the fact : I believe passionately in that curated museum experience.
In the late spring , early summer of 2010 , shortly after McQueen ' s suicide , our curator of costume , Andrew Bolton , came to see me , and said ,  " I ' ve been thinking of doing a show on McQueen , and now is the moment . We have to , we have to do it fast. " 
And in this extraordinary setting , the costumes were like actors and actresses , or living sculptures.
I heard over and over again ,  " Wow , that was worth it.
It ' s in our galleries that we can unpack the civilizations , the cultures , that we ' re seeing the current manifestation of.
Now , in our galleries , we show 14 centuries of the development of different Islamic cultures across a vast geographic spread , and , again , hundreds of thousands of people have come to see these galleries since they opened last October.
Bringing people face to face with our objects is a way of bringing them face to face with people across time , across space , whose lives may have been very different to our own , but who , like us , had hopes and dreams , frustrations and achievements in their lives . And I think this is a process that helps us better understand ourselves , helps us make better decisions about where we ' re going.
Some of them are comfortable . They feel at home.
I ' m working to try and break down that sense of that elitism.
Wow . She is a gorgeous embodiment of youthful sexuality.
They ' ve been called the  " saints of Somalia. "  Doctor Hawa Abdi and her daughter Deqo Mohamed discuss their medical clinic in Somalia , where -- in the face of civil war and open oppression of women -- they ' ve built a hospital , a school and a community of peace.
Hawa Abdi : Many people -- 20 years for Somalia -- [were] fighting.
So our patients are women and children.
Pat Mitchell : And this is your hospital . This is the inside.
But sometimes we are only five doctors and 16 nurses , and we are physically getting exhausted to see all of them.
That ' s their house.
HA : The people who are coming to us , we are welcoming.
[Whomever] makes those things we throw out.
That ' s our two rules.
We are not just the helpless and the victims of the civil war.
So we came up with these two rules.
So if you beat your wife , you ' re going to be there.
You ' re also running a civil society.
But one day , I went to the hospital -- my mother was sick -- and I saw the hospital , how they [were] treating the doctors , how they [are] committed to help the sick people.
My mother died in [a] gynecology complication , so I decided to become a gynecology specialist.
Maybe I should become an historian , or maybe a reporter.
So I went to Russia , and my mother also , [during the] time of [the] Soviet Union.
She ' s here . She ' s also a doctor.
PM : So what is the biggest challenge working , mother and daughter , in such dangerous and sometimes scary situations ? 
But I remained with those people , and I was trying to do something -- [any] little thing I [could] do.
And I ' m thankful for my daughters.
PM : What ' s the best part of working with your mother , and the most challenging part for you ? 
That ' s the best part.
PM : But you do it for good reasons.
HA : Thank you very much . DM : Thank you very much.

One is NASA , with a mission to explore the great beyond , to explore the heavens , which we all want to go to if we ' re lucky.
And my question is this :  " why are we ignoring the oceans ?  " 
And hell is down here ?  Is it a cultural issue ? 
OK . And what we ' re going to do is we ' re going to immerse ourselves in my world.
And most of all , it was not even in my college textbooks.
In today ' s context , it was a bunch of crap , but it was the law of geology , vertical tectonics.
And everything we ' re going to talk about represents a one tenth of one percent glimpse , because that ' s all we ' ve seen.
It is not a map.
We had more exploration ships down there during Captain Cook ' s time than now . It ' s amazing.
You know , we ' re going to do this , we ' re going to take it away from something else.
50 percent of our country that we own , have all legal jurisdiction , have all rights to do whatever we want , lies beneath the sea and we have better maps of Mars than that 50 percent.
I was a body surfer and I thought ,  " Wow , that was an incredible wave! " 
Alvin and Sea Cliff and Cyana , and all the major deep submersibles we have , which are about eight.
The mid-ocean ridge runs around like the seam on a baseball.
So we went to the moon , played golf up there , before we went to the largest feature on our own planet.
But no one had actually gone down into the actual site of the boundary of creation as we call it -- into the Rift Valley -- until a group of seven of us crawled in our little submarines in the summer of 1973 , 1974 and were the first human beings to enter the Great Rift Valley.
Most of our planet does not feel the warmth of the sun.
Or so we thought . And so in our initial explorations , we were totally focused on exploring the boundary of creation , looking at the volcanic features running along that entire 42,000 miles.
So , it ' s a phenomenally active region , it ' s not just a dark , boring place . It ' s a very alive place.
In plate tectonic theory , we knew that if you had plates collide , it made sense : they would crush into one another , you would thicken the crust , you ' d uplift it.
It should not be . Until one of my colleagues said ,  " It looks to me like a thermal blister , and the mid-ocean ridge must be a cooling curve. "  We said ,  " Let ' s go find out. " 
But the only logical [explanation] was that there were hot springs.
It was amazing . These giant chimneys , huge giant chimneys.
And then we realized our probe was made out of the same stuff -- it could have melted . But it turns out the exiting temperature was 650 degrees F , hot enough to melt lead.
So the Easter Bunny has put things in the ocean floor , and you have massive heavy metal deposits that we ' re making in this mountain range.
We went and found these incredible clam beds sitting on the barren rock . Large clams , and when we opened them , they didn ' t look like a clam.
None of it in our textbooks . None of this in our textbooks.
So , we wanted to accelerate this process.
So , I began designing a new technology of telepresence , using robotic systems to replicate myself , so I wouldn ' t have to cycle my vehicle system.
But more importantly , they discovered edifices down there that they did not understand.
How do you do that ?  That ' s water upside down.
All the way at the other end , in an alkaline environment , at a pH of 11 , life existed.
Again , you know , we stop at the water ' s edge.
Near that was methane . I ' ve never seen volcanoes of methane.
It contains more history than all of the museums on land combined.
People always ask ,  " Did you find the right ship ?  " 
We ' ve been discovering these along ancient trade routes , where they ' re not supposed to be.
More recently , into the Black Sea , where we ' re exploring.
Look at the state of preservation -- still the ad mark of a carpenter . Look at the state of those artifacts.
We begin to go on the Hill and lobby.
Its mission is to go where no one has gone before on planet Earth.
But certainly , it ' s going to be going to the unknown America.
The way we ' re going to run this -- we have no idea what we ' re going to discover.
We ' re going to connect our command center , via a high-bandwidth satellite link to a building we ' re building at the University of Rhode Island , called the Interspace Center.
We ' ll go into areas we have no knowledge of.
This is a remote center at the University of Washington.
They can follow this expedition . I ' ve started a program -- where are you Jim ?  Jim Young who helped me start a program called the Jason Project . More recently , we ' ve started a program with the Boys and Girls Clubs of America , so that we can use exploration , and the excitement of live exploration , to motivate them and excite them and then give them what they ' re already ready for.
Because we want to create -- we want to create the classroom of tomorrow.
We need to be not only proud of our universities.
This is a young lady , not watching a football game , not watching a basketball game.
This , I hope , will be a future engineer or a future scientist in the battle for truth.
http://www.ted.com/talks/daphne_koller_what_we_re_learning_from_online_education.html
Daphne Koller : What we ' re learning from online education
In my childhood , I played around in my father ' s university lab.
In South Africa , the educational system was constructed in the days of apartheid for the white minority.
When the gates opened , there was a stampede , and 20 people were injured and one woman died.
What might not be quite as obvious to people is that during that same period the cost of higher education tuition has been increasing at almost twice the rate , for a total of 559 percent since 1985.
This , of course , is not true for the students who graduate from the top institutions , but for many others , they do not get the value for their time and their effort.
Let ' s talk about what ' s suddenly possible.
It ' s a Machine Learning class , and it has 400 people enrolled every time it ' s offered.
So , having seen the impact of this , Andrew and I decided that we needed to really try and scale this up , to bring the best quality education to as many people as we could.
Ezekiel Emanuel : Fifty million people are uninsured.
Mitchell Duneier : Mills wants the student of sociology to develop the quality of mind ...
Dan Jurafsky : Does Lufthansa serve breakfast and San Jose ?  Well , that sounds funny.
Since we opened the website in February , we now have 640,000 students from 190 countries.
Or Jenny , who is a single mother of two and wants to hone her skills so that she can go back and complete her master ' s degree.
So what made these courses so different ? 
And these would be real homework assignments for a real grade , with a real deadline.
They could present that certificate to a prospective employer and get a better job , and we know many students who did.
The first component is that when you move away from the constraints of a physical classroom and design content explicitly for an online format , you can break away from , for example , the monolithic one-hour lecture.
Other students might be interested in a particular enrichment topic that they want to pursue individually.
There ' s been a range of studies that demonstrate the importance of this.
Every few minutes , the video pauses and the students get asked a question.
So they get to try again , and this time they got it right.
And so the lecture moves on before , really , most of the students have even noticed that a question had been asked.
Now , how do you grade the work of 100,000 students if you do not have 10,000 TAs ? 
We can grade models , whether it ' s financial models in a business class or physical models in a science or engineering class and we can grade some pretty sophisticated programming assignments.
And so , the student tries again , and now they got it right , and they ' re told that , and they can move on to the next assignment.
So we tried to convince , for example , some of our humanities faculty that multiple choice was not such a bad strategy.
It turns out that previous studies show , like this one by Saddler and Good , that peer grading is a surprisingly effective strategy for providing reproducible grades.
So we now have the largest peer-grading pipeline ever devised , where tens of thousands of students are grading each other ' s work , and quite successfully , I have to say.
Students collaborated in these courses in a variety of different ways.
Which is not a level of service I have ever offered to my Stanford students.
This is the San Francisco study group , but there were ones all over the world.
Because the data that we can collect here is unique.
And in the context of particular courses , you can ask questions like , what are some of the misconceptions that are more common and how do we help students fix them ? 
Each of the little crosses that you see is a different wrong answer.
So Andrew and his students went in , looked at some of those assignments , understood the root cause of the misconception , and then they produced a targeted error message that would be provided to every student whose answer fell into that bucket , which means that students who made that same mistake would now get personalized feedback telling them how to fix their misconception much more effectively.
The first is the population that studied in a lecture-based classroom.
To understand what that means , let ' s look at the lecture-based classroom , and let ' s pick the median performance as a threshold.
Hence , the 2 sigma problem.
Mastery is easy to achieve using a computer , because a computer doesn ' t get tired of showing you the same video five times.
So , if this is so great , are universities now obsolete ? 
I think what he was complaining about is not universities but rather the lecture-based format that so many universities spend so much time on.
We do that by doing active learning in the classroom.
So to summarize , if we could offer a top quality education to everyone around the world for free , what would that do ?  Three things.
By having this amazing content be available , we would be able to learn something new every time we wanted , whether it ' s just to expand our minds or it ' s to change our lives.
http://www.ted.com/talks/emily_levine_s_theory_of_everything.html
Emily Levine ' s theory of everything
I thought narcissism meant you loved yourself.
But I want to , though , explain how I came to design my own particular brand of comedy because I ' ve been through so many different forms of it.
It ' s all about contradiction , which I think is why I ' m so sensitive to contradiction in general.
But only two percent don ' t know the effect that the debacle in Argentina will have on the IMF ' s monetary policy -- seems a contradiction.
 " Surviving the Slammer : Do ' s and Don ' ts. " 
And I suppose it ' s a contradiction that I talk about science when I don ' t know math.
That ' s why little girls don ' t do math . It ' s too depressing.
One of them , to his credit , I think really just wanted to engage me in a serious argument.
Well rationality is constructed by what Christie Hefner was talking about today , that mind-body split , you know ? 
And as David Lee Roth sang in  " Just a Gigolo, "   " I ain ' t got no body. " 
That ' s why you have the Raspyni Brothers whacking Richard in the genital area.
That ' s the other way that humor -- like Art Buchwald takes shots at the heads of state.
So I went back and re-read  " The Fountainhead. " 
 " The act of a master taking painful contemptuous possession of her , was the kind of rapture she wanted.
The agony as an act of passion. " 
Now we have to picture Alan Greenspan in a black leather corset , with a butt tattoo that says ,  " Whip inflation now. " 
That ' s how you assert yourself.
I don ' t know if you know this but -- maybe it ' s different now , or maybe you were making a statement -- but in many hospital nurseries across the country , until very recently anyway , according to a book by Jessica Benjamin , the signs over the little boys cribs read ,  " I ' m a boy, "  and the signs over the little girls cribs read ,  " It ' s a girl. "  Yeah.
And well , yeah.
So this subject-object thing , is part of something I ' m very interested in because this is why , frankly , I believe in political correctness.
Maybe too far . But you know -- I don ' t think that a person of color making fun of white people is the same thing as a white person making fun of people of color.
What ' s funny about being down to four houses ? 
It seems , I suppose , a harmless prejudice and that you ' re not really hurting anybody.
I read a book by a woman named Amy Richlin , who is the chair of the Classics department at USC.
And so was humor.
A lot of heckling is the tension of trying to make sure that the comedian is going to be able to dominate , and overcome the heckler.
And so I wanted something that was more interactive.
I used to actually hang up on them.
But the interactivity allows the audience to shape what you ' re going to do as much as you shape their experience of the world.
I mean he had laid it all out.
And one of these is boundary crossing.
I hope that ' s my agent , because you aren ' t paying me anything.
He was a very selfish meme.
And you know people , this is the problem with quote , objectivity , unquote.
My grandmother always acted in other people ' s interests , whether they wanted her to or not.
Where am I going ?  I ' m going to die soon. " 
And this is instead of contradiction.
It said ,  " Ears pierced while you wait. " 
Huh ?  Huh ?  What ?  Can ' t hear you. " 
That , and I will say this to the scientists , that the trickster has the ability to hold his ideas lightly so that he can let room in for new ideas or to see the contradictions or the hidden problems with his ideas.
This is what I tend to see almost more than contradictions.
Like I ' ll read that one of the two attributes of matter in the Newtonian universe -- there are two attributes of matter in the Newtonian universe -- one is space occupancy . Matter takes up space.
Masculinity depended on you being the active penetrator.
And now we ' re being penetrated.
That ' s the second of the quadruple.
You know , make you not follow your usual train of association , but make you rewire.
And the mother goes right through a red light.
And the daughter says , as tactfully as possible ,  " Mom , are you aware that you just went through two red lights ?  " 
I just want to say two more things.
Finding the balance between those things is always dangerous because you might tip off too much in the direction of unprepared.
You ' re into something that occupies space and inhabits time.
I like to think of what I do as a probability wave.
He ' s always on the road.
Kaki King , the first female on Rolling Stone ' s  " guitar god "  list , rocks out to a full live set at TED2008 , including her breakout single ,  " Playing with Pink Noise. "  Jaw-dropping virtuosity meets a guitar technique that truly stands out.
I was thinking about my place in the universe , and about my first thought about what infinity might mean , when I was a child.
Therefore every moment really is the most important moment that ' s ever happened , including this moment right now.
Because it ' s like the stage is an optical illusion , for some reason.
Thank you very much.

The science writers and editors -- I shouldn ' t say science writers , I should say people who write about science -- and editors would sit down over a couple of beers , after a hard day of work , and start talking about some of these incredible perceptions about how the universe works.
Yeah , we need the time!
So , we went out looking for solutions to ways that the world might end tomorrow , and lo and behold , we found them.
SP : I agree with the president.
I would propose , therefore , that if we took 10 billion dollars from that 2.13 trillion dollar budget -- which is two one hundredths of that budget -- and we doled out a billion dollars to each one of these problems I ' m going to talk to you about , the vast majority could be solved , and the rest we could deal with . So , I hope you find this both fascinating -- I ' m fascinated by this kind of stuff , I gotta admit -- to me these are Richard ' s cockroaches.
We are all much healthier than we were 20 years ago.
Soon , genetic breakthroughs and even better medicine are going to allow us to think of 100 as a normal lifespan.
So , what are the solutions ? 
Pills alone don ' t do it , especially in clinically depressed people.
Moving on . Number nine -- don ' t laugh -- aliens invade Earth.
In a few years , NASA is going to launch four or five telescopes out to Jupiter , where there ' s less dust , and start looking for Earth-like planets , which we cannot see with present technology , nor detect.
Although every time I go to Pompeii , I ' m amazed that they had the equivalent of a McDonald ' s on every street corner , too.
We can look at our own history . The late physicist Gerard O ' Neill said ,  " Advanced Western civilization has had a destructive effect on all primitive civilizations it has come in contact with , even in those cases where every attempt was made to protect and guard the primitive civilization. " 
It may seem ridiculous , but we have a really lousy history of anticipating things like this and actually being prepared for them.
If we want humanity to last forever , we have to colonize the Milky Way.
Last July , in Science , the journal Science , 19 oceanographers published a very , very unusual article.
We ' re living in a time of mass extinctions that exceeds the fossil record by a factor of 10,000.
You cut down that tree , the rain forest collapses as an ecosystem.
The problem with ecosystems is that we understand them so poorly , that we don ' t know they ' re really in trouble until it ' s almost too late.
And they get to prioritize , you know ? 
There ' s been an experiment for the last four or five years on the Georges Bank , or the Grand Banks off of Newfoundland . It ' s a no-take fishing zone.
Let it recover , before we start logging again.
A lot of very sober-minded physicists , believe it or not , have had exactly the same thought.
I hope they ' re right.
But there ' s talk of building very big accelerators.
Secondly , we have a natural laboratory surrounding the Earth.
It ' s one of my favorite ones , because we ' ve done several stories on Bt corn.
But the thing that ' s alarming is a couple of months ago , in Mexico , where Bt corn and all genetically altered corn is totally illegal , they found Bt corn genes in wild corn plants.
So , what do we do about that ? 
Number five , one of my favorites : reversal of the Earth ' s magnetic field.
SP : So , what can we do about this ?  Oh , by the way , we ' re overdue.
Scientists think now our magnetic field may be diminished by about five percent.
There ' s going to be a lot of cheap rocketry that ' s going to come online in about six or seven years that gets us into the low atmosphere very cheaply.
You don ' t need that much up there.
So far , our atmosphere has done , and our magnetic field has done pretty well protecting us from this.
Obviously , we don ' t want one of those.
Start terraforming Mars . This is one of my favorite subjects.
And you just , literally , have to send little nuclear factories up there that gobble up the iron oxide on the surface of Mars and spit out the oxygen.
Number three -- isn ' t this stuff cool ? 
The bubonic plague in Europe , in the Middle Ages , killed one out of four Europeans.
And we know staph can do amazing things.
So , what can we do about it ? 
We ' re telling the germs out there how to fight us.
Now , there is money in the federal budget , next year , to build up the public health service.
And now , if you went into one of those conventions and you said ,  " Well , I don ' t think black holes are out there, "  they ' d hoot you off the stage.
Most of them should be in orbit around something.
But it only has to get close , about a billion miles away , one of these things.
That won ' t work too well . What can we do about this ? 
And finally , number one : biggest danger to life as we know it , I think , a really big asteroid heads for Earth.
Astronomers estimate that little asteroids like that come about every hundred years.
A small asteroid , say a half mile wide , would touch off firestorms followed by severe global cooling from the debris kicked up -- Carl Sagan ' s nuclear winter thing.
There ' s also something a little farther out , called the Oort cloud.
So you say , yeah , well , what are really the chances of this happening ? 
Now look at the one right below that.
Could we have the solutions ? 
But it ' s going to take them 10 years , at spending three million dollars a year , and even then , they claim they ' ll only have about 80 percent of them catalogued.
We really need a dedicated observatory.
We sent a probe out to this asteroid belt , called NEAR , Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous.
We have landed a rocket ship on an asteroid . It ' s not a big deal.
This is just a matter of finding  ' em , going there , and doing something about it.
We don ' t want to get caught flat-footed again.
The worst thing we can do is say , jeez , I got enough to worry about without worrying about an asteroid.
mission blue,oceans,poetry,science,technology
We ' re in 17th century Japan on the west coast , and a little , wizened monk is hurrying along , near midnight , to the crest of a small hill.
Then he says to himself , very quietly ,  " [Turbulent the sea,] [Stretching across to Sado] [The Milky Way]. " 
As he was nearing his death , his disciples and followers kept asking him ,  " What ' s the secret ? 
Sylvia has said we must use every capacity we have in order to know the oceans.
There are a few key points.
So what scientists do when they begin is to start with the system.
It ' s the whole planet , the entire planet , continents and oceans together.
And these two war against one another almost continuously.
It ' s immensely complex.
What do I mean by that ? 
This is very , very important because this is the system , this is the crucible , out of which life on the planet came , and it ' s now time for us to understand it.
This is only one variable.
And there ' s an urgency to this.
We can ' t solve all the problems by looking only at the oceans , but if we don ' t understand the fundamental life support system of this planet much more thoroughly than we do now , then the stresses that we will face , and that Cody will face , and even Nancy , who ' s going to live till she ' s 98 , will have really problems coping.
What you ' ll see is that the rhythms of growth , of vegetation -- a subset of which is food on the continents -- is directly tied to the rhythms of the sea surface temperatures.
I ' m going to layer in on top of this the tectonic plates.
Now you ' ve heard of hydrothermal vents , but the other discovery is that deep below the sea floor , there is vast reservoir of microbial activity , which we have only just discovered and we have almost no way to study.
It may be the next rainforest , in terms of pharmaceuticals.
And it wasn ' t easy . It wasn ' t easy in those days.
And the program that I wanted to talk to you about just a little bit here , was funded , and it involves autonomous vehicles like the one running across the base of this image.
They are changing rapidly , but not predictably.
And that ' s what we really need.
We will be present throughout the volume of the ocean , at will , communicating in real time.
It was once called Neptune.
You can transmit power , but the bandwidth is in those tiny , little threads smaller than the hair on your head in diameter.
We are already laced up as if we ' re in a fiber optic corset , if you like.
So this is the system that I ' m talking about , off the west coast . It ' s coincident with the tectonic plate , the Juan de Fuca tectonic plate.
And the kind of science that can be done will be determined by a variety of scientists who want to be involved and can bring the instrumentation to the table.
So anyone coming along later simply accesses the database and can draw down the information they need about anything that has taken place.
On the left hand side there is a large volcano called Axial Seamount.
That ' s an elevator that ' s constantly moving up and down , but it can be controlled by the folks on land who are responsible for it.
We ' re flying across the caldera floor.
It ' s a full spectrum of tools.
Very , very powerful.
There are emerging technologies throughout the field around oceanography , which we will incorporate into oceanography , and through that convergence , we will transform oceanography into something even more magical.
It ' s smaller than a postage stamp , and it can generate power just by being attached to your shirt as you move.
And this is the magic one.
So in the volume of the ocean , we will know , not just the physics and the chemistry , but the base of the food chain will be transparent to us with data on a continuous basis.
And the next generation fiber will be simply magic.
Delivering the power and the bandwidth into the ocean will dramatically accelerate adaptation.
We ' ve determined from the earthquake activity that you ' re seeing here that the top of that volcano is erupting , so we deploy the troops.
They eject it to the surface where it floats , and it is picked up by an autonomous airplane , and it ' s brought back to the laboratory within 24 hours of the eruption.
We could do work on the sea floor that would be stunning , and it would be on live TV , if we have interesting things to show.
And as I go here , I just want to show you what we can bring into classrooms , and indeed , what we can bring into your pocket.
In 1943 , T.S . Eliot wrote the  " Four Quartets. " 
http://www.ted.com/talks/daniel_libeskind_s_17_words_of_architectural_inspiration.html
Daniel Libeskind ' s 17 words of architectural inspiration
And yet , when I look at the environment outside , you see how resistant architecture is to change.
We applaud the well-mannered box.
It ' s based on wonder.
But it is a story of effort and struggle against improbabilities.
There it is : the things that I really believe are of important architecture.
But I think these are the necessary oxygen for us to live in buildings , to live in cities , to connect ourselves in a social space.
But architecture is that complete ecstasy that the future can be better.
Think of the Empire State Building , the Rockefeller Center.
I have never been a fan of the neutral.
That ' s what expression is.
Expressive spaces are not spaces that simply confirm what we already know.
So again , radical versus conservative.
It is actually a living connection to the cosmic event that we are part of , and a story that is certainly ongoing.
You know the Soviet architecture of that building is the conservation.
Therefore I believe it should not be cool.
Even the mind is emotional.
And I think that is what makes the world a wondrous place.
Inexplicable versus understood . You know , too often we want to understand everything.
So the important thing actually , is to introduce the actual architectural dimensions , which might be totally inexplicable in words , because they operate in proportions , in materials , in light.
Of course , what would we be without computers ? 
We realize that the hand has been given us by forces that are beyond our own autonomy.
Listening to all of you , the complexity of thought , the complexity of layers of meaning is overwhelming.
Space is something that folds out of itself into completely new worlds.
Our intellectual desires are complex.
The politeama is the city . It ' s all of us together.
And I do believe that this interaction with the history , with history that is often very difficult , to grapple with it , to create a position that is beyond our normal expectations and to create a critique.
Therefore it is important that it be real.
So the reality of architecture is visceral . It ' s not intellectual.
Unexpected versus habitual.
You know , it ' s true , the cathedrals , as unexpected , will always be unexpected.
When we see the same kind of architecture we become immured in that world of those angles , of those lights , of those materials.
And I often think of the raw and the refined.
And of course that juxtaposition is of great interest to me because it creates a kind of a spark of new energy.
And of course buildings have their shapes.
So I believe that my main interest is to memory.
Critics like the performance to be repeated again and again the same way.
There would be nowhere to turn.
It tells a story . The story can reach into obscure desires.
Silence maybe is good for a cemetery but not for a city.
And these are our dreams.
And I think , of course , risk is what underlies the world.
Risks of spaces that have never been so dizzying , as they should be , for a pioneering city.
It ' s not about decoration.
So again , it ' s not about the changing fashions , changing theories.
And I think that is really the nature of architecture.
We too often admire those buildings . We think they are beautiful.
It ' s such a complex project.
There are emotions of the victims.
And it is about the dirty word  " compromise. "  Compromise is not bad.
It ' s difficult . 2011 , 2013 . Freedom Tower , the memorial.
This is what we dream about . Its individuality , demonstrated in the skyline . It ' s resilience.
Daniel Libeskind : Look . We have to cure ourselves of the notion that we are authoritarian , that we can determine everything that happens.
And I believe that what will be built at Ground Zero will be meaningful , will be inspiring , will tell other generations of the sacrifices , of the meaning of this event.
In his home of Namibia , John Kasaona is working on an innovative way to protect endangered animal species : giving nearby villagers responsibility for caring for the animals . And it ' s working.
In Africa we say ,  " God gave the white man a watch and gave the black man time. " 
But my story that I would like to share with you today is the one about success.
It ' s called Kunene region.
They love Namibia for its beautiful dunes , that are even taller than the Empire State Building.
I ' m a Himba and Namibian.
And one day , my father actually took me into the bush.
 " And he will let go of the goat and run off. " 
But then , he said ,  " If you see a leopard , boy , you better run like hell. " 
And it is very important if you are in the field to know what to confront and what to run from.
Whenever we tried to hunt , we were called poachers.
And the army hunted for valuable rhino horns and tusks.
Then in the same time , around 1980 , we had a very big drought.
I remember a night when a hungry leopard went into the house of one of our neighbors and took a sleeping child out of the bed.
And then , in the same year , we almost lost everything.
They actually spend a lot of time a year in the communities.
But then , the people from IRDNC proposed to Joshua : What if we pay people that you trust to look after wildlife ? 
 " Yes . Our poachers. " 
And thus , as people started feeling ownership over wildlife , wildlife numbers started coming back , and that ' s actually becoming a foundation for conservation in Namibia.
And at this sacred fire , the spirit of our ancestors speak through the headman and advise us where to get water , where to get grazings , and where to go and hunt.
And these things we were taught by outsiders.
And through this , we actually started realizing our dreams , and we maintained honoring our traditions but we were still open to new ideas.
These were our own people.
And that was a very strong thing in Namibia.
Business communities helped bring Namibia onto the world map and they have also helped make wildlife a very valuable land use like any other land uses such as agriculture.
Namibia .. . or Sesfontein was no more an isolated village somewhere , hidden away in Namibia.
When I finished school in 1995 , there were only 20 lions in the entire Northwest -- in our area.
The black rhino -- they were almost extinct in 1982.
They stay very much far away because this other thing has multiplied from less than a thousand to tens of thousands of animals.
We have already reshaped conservation in the entire country.
And we are able to use this money for many things : Very importantly , we put it in education.
And this is the good news from Africa that we have to shout from the rooftops.
We knew conservation would fail if it doesn ' t work to improve the lives of the local communities.
Photographer James Balog shares new image sequences from the Extreme Ice Survey , a network of time-lapse cameras recording glaciers receding at an alarming rate , some of the most vivid evidence yet of climate change.
Most of the time , art and science stare at each other across a gulf of mutual incomprehension.
In the Extreme Ice Survey , we ' re dedicated to bringing those two parts of human understanding together , to merging the art and science to the end of helping us understand nature and humanity ' s relationship with nature better.
These first images are from Greenland.
Climate change is a really abstract thing in most of the world.
All of that , strip it away . In the world of the arctic and alpine environments , where the ice is , it ' s real and it ' s present.
That ' s outside Antarctica.
And the great irony and tragedy of our time is that a lot of the general public thinks that science is still arguing about that.
I hadn ' t realized it was based on concrete measurements of what the paleoclimates -- the ancient climates -- were , as recorded in the ice sheets , as recorded in deep ocean sediments , as recorded in lake sediments , tree rings , and a lot of other ways of measuring temperature.
And one crazy day , I got the idea that I should -- after that assignment was finished -- I got the idea that I should shoot in time-lapse photography , that I should station a camera or two at a glacier and let it shoot every 15 minutes , or every hour or whatever and watch the progression of the landscape over time.
Power goes into a battery . There is a custom made computer that tells the camera when to fire.
Actually , there ' s still a camera out there right now.
I personally obsessed about every nut , bolt and washer in these crazy things.
It ' s a big undertaking . I stand here before you tonight as an ambassador for my whole team.
And we ' ve spent a lot of time in the field . It ' s been a fantastic amount of work.
You know , scientists have collected this kind of information off and on over the years , but a lot of it stays within the science community.
Now , one bit of science before we get into the visuals.
This exact same pattern is seen going back now almost a million years before our current time.
Nature naturally has allowed carbon dioxide to go up to 280 parts per million.
Right now , if you look at the top right part of that graph , we ' re at 385 parts per million.
At the rate of about two and a half parts per million per year.
But anyway , off to the world of ice.
You see the glacier flowing in from the right , dropping off into the sea , camera shooting every hour.
This is not a little cliff . This is like a major office building in an urban center.
This was an aerial picture I did one day in June three years ago.
We ' re going to be up there in just a few more weeks , and we expect that it ' s probably retreated another half a mile , but if I got there and discovered that it had collapsed and it was five miles further back , I wouldn ' t be the least bit surprised.
There ' s a marker line called the trim line above our little red illustration there.
These changes in the alpine world are accelerating.
So , here ' s another time-lapse shot of Columbia.
Geologic process in action here.
And you can look at these pictures over and over again because there ' s such a strange , bizarre fascination in seeing these things you don ' t normally get to see come alive.
These huge crevasses open up.
To give you a feeling for the scale of the retreat , we did another cheesy illustration , with British double-decker buses.
One of my favorite glaciers , the Sólheimajökull.
Without the photographic process , you would never see this . This is invisible.
That ' s where it started.
Greenland took a little while to start reacting to the warming climate of the past century , but it really started galloping along about 20 years ago.
The one glacier up in Greenland that puts more ice into the global ocean than all the other glaciers in the northern hemisphere combined is the Ilulissat Glacier.
The calving face is four and a half miles across , and in this shot , as we pull back , you ' re only seeing about a mile and a half.
Icebergs , many , many , many , many times the size of this building , are roaring out to sea.
It now goes at 125 feet a day , dumping all this ice into the ocean.
This is what a couple of the cameras saw.
So an illustration again , gives you a feeling for scale.
75 minutes.
I ' m certain that we can.
But we still need to bring a lot of people along with us.
This is a terrific , terrific call to arms to do the right thing for ourselves and for the future.
environment,fish,food,oceans,sustainability
The who and the why are what ' s important to me.
I want to know why they fish.
So what do we call this ? 
It is a more hopeful , it is a more human , and is a more useful way of understanding our environment.
But in my mind , it ' s really not enough to just eat green list.
Pole caught -- no bycatch.
Am I sitting down in a steakhouse to a 16-ounce portion of this ? 
Example : I ' ve heard that red wine is great for my health -- antioxidants and minerals -- heart healthy.
Well folks , we have a protein problem.
And we are hiding that cost behind monster profits.
Sylvia likes to say that blue is the new green.
The best part about restorative seafood though is that it comes on the half-shell with a bottle of Tabasco and lemon wedges.
And the best part is all of those ingredients are available to every family at the neighborhood Walmart.
Forget nuclear holocaust ; it ' s the fork that we have to worry about.
Sustainability is complicated but dinner is a reality that we all very much understand.
But green foods often represent a way for us to disregard the responsibility as eaters.
But we can never have any eco-friendly all-you-can-eat shrimp buffet.
Studies say that tens of thousands of American grandmothers , grandfathers , mothers and fathers might be around for another birthday if we included more seafood.
As a chef , I realize the easiest thing for me to do is reduce the portion sizes on my plate.
People spent more time engaging in their meals , engaging with each other over their meals.
This is great.
We were directing tastes towards more resilience , more restorative options.
But what of those big predators , those fashionable species , that green list tuna that I was talking about earlier ? 
Get a knife . Cut it into four portions.
Invite your friends and neighbors over and repeat once a year , maybe.
I was lucky enough that my father was a fantastic cook.
This is still how I largely eat today.
It ' s disgusting.
So what are we looking for in a meal ? 
For community though , we start at the very beginning.
But it is more than just a repository of our resources ; it ' s also the global geography of the communion we call dinner.
And we need to save dinner.

http://www.ted.com/talks/bill_doyle_treating_cancer_with_electric_fields.html
Bill Doyle : Treating cancer with electric fields
I ' m very thankful to Jay and to Mark and the TEDMED team for inviting me today to describe a fourth tool , a new tool , that we call Tumor Treating Fields.
Let me first address a few popular misconceptions.
What electric fields are are a field of forces.
We can all picture astronauts in space.
And as they land , they ' re fully aligned in the gravitational field.
In cancer , cells rapidly divide and lead to uncontrolled tumor growth.
Importantly , those special proteins are among the most highly charged objects in our body.
Tumor Treating Fields use externally placed transducers attached to a field generator to create an artificial electric field on that space station.
And they will either enter into this so-called cellular suicide , programmed cell death , or they will form unhealthy daughter cells and enter into apoptosis once they have divided.
And we ' ve stained these cultures with a green florescent dye so that we can look at these proteins that form these chains.
When we apply the fields -- again , in the identical time-scale to the identical culture -- you ' re going to see something different.
But see how much of the protein is still throughout the nucleus , even in the dividing cell.
We ' ve applied Tumor Treating Fields to over 20 different cancers in the lab , and we see this effect in all of them.
The first cancer that we have focused on is the deadly brain cancer , GBM.
And the typical patient with optimal therapy survives just a little over a year , and only about seven months from the time that the cancer is first treated and then comes back and starts growing again.
The first group received second-line chemotherapy , which is expected to double the life expectancy , versus no treatment at all.
They had no pain , suffered none of the infections.
So I ' m going to show you now one of the patients from this trial.
He received the standard treatments.
A year after this treatment -- in fact , this is his baseline MRI.
At this point , he was told by his doctors that he had about 3 months to live.
They ' re attached to the skin in the area of the tumor.
There ' s none of what is called the  " chemo head. " 
These are Robert ' s MRIs , again , under only TTField treatment.
It ' s still there.
Robert Dill-Bundi : My quality of life , I rate what I have today a bit different than what most people would assume.
BD : Novocure ' s also working on lung cancer as the second target.
She was diagnosed with lung cancer five years ago.
You can see , in her case , she ' s wearing her transducer arrays , one of the front of her chest , one on the back , and then the second pair side-to-side over the liver.
And when we talked to her , she said that when she was undergoing chemotherapy , she had to go to the hospital every month for her infusions.
In the lab , we ' ve observed tremendous synergies between chemotherapy and Tumor Treating Fields.
We have more trials planned for lung cancer , pancreatic cancer , ovarian cancer and breast cancer.
With wisdom and wit , Anupam Mishra talks about the amazing feats of engineering built centuries ago by the people of India ' s Golden Desert to harvest water . These structures are still used today -- and are often superior to modern water megaprojects.
For emotions , we should not move quickly to the desert.
If you are well-versed with inches , nine inches , centimeters , 16 [centimeters].
But suppose you use the green technology , solar pumps -- they are of no use in this area.
There are a number of techniques to harvest rain.
So , this is the first device they use in harvesting rain.
And this is all big raised platform.
And then it is 40 feet deep.
Below the surface there is hard saline water.
Because we are used to get written things.
In fact they go 15 feet deep , and collect rain water from roof , there is a small pipe , and from their courtyard.
And it can collect six million gallons of rainwater in one season.
It draws water from 15 kilometers of canals.
Of course if you want to go inside , the two doors are locked.
And the water level -- these are not empty canisters -- water level is right up to this.
The government thought that this is a very backward area and we should bring a multi-million dollar project to bring water from the Himalayas.
In many portions , water hyacinth covered these big canals like anything.
We had full-page advertisements , some 30 years , 25 years ago when this canal came.
And people started renovating their own structures.
Jaisalmer . This is heart of desert.
Well connected , 800 years ago , through Europe.
You won ' t find water in this slide.
But apart from this system , they designed 52 beautiful water bodies around this town.
You will admire it . Just behold the beauty throughout the year.
When this rain comes and the water starts filling this tank , it will submerge these beautiful statues in what we call in English today  " mass communication. " 
Another small water body , called the [unclear].
In severe drought periods nobody has seen this water body getting dried up.
Dry water body . Children are standing on a very difficult device to explain.
But this is no ordinary well.
And it was deposited by the great mother Earth , some three million years ago.
But when the water goes down they will be able to draw water from those structures throughout the year.
There are three things : concept , planning , making the actual thing , and also maintaining them.
Don ' t spit , don ' t do anything wrong , so that the clean water can be collected.
And you have to go further down.
So , throughout the year this beautiful system will give you some pleasure.
The best civil engineers we had , the best planners , the best architects.
but not to create the engineering colleges.
This tire comes from the airplane.
Tattoo was , at one time , a kind of a blacklisted or con thing , but now it is in thing.
These are the beautiful stairs which we just saw in one of the slides.
Chris Anderson : So , first of all , I wish I had your eloquence , truly , in any language.
Anupam Mishra : No , the basic idea is to utilize water that falls on our area.
So , it depends on the terrain.
CA : Thank you so much.

So that ' s why I ' ve always been fascinated with how technology could actually reshape and open up authoritarian societies like ours.
So this is when I ran out of my idealism and decided to quit my NGO job and actually study how the Internet could impede democratization.
And I think by 2009 , this news has finally reached Britain , so I should probably add Gordon Brown to this list as well.
To put it very simply , the assumption so far has been that if you give people enough connectivity , if you give them enough devices , democracy will inevitably follow.
But I think a much bigger problem with this is that this logic -- that we should be dropping iPods not bombs -- I mean , it would make a fascinating title for Thomas Friedman ' s new book.
But even beyond that , coming back to the Internet , what you can actually see is that certain governments have mastered the use of cyberspace for propaganda purposes . Right ? 
So you may wonder , why on Earth are they doing it ? 
So the more you block it , the more it emboldens people to actually avoid the censorship and thus win in this cat-and-mouse game.
There was a big case in February 2009 called  " Elude the Cat. " 
So they immediately began posting a lot of critical comments.
And they basically said ,  " Look guys . We ' d like you to become netizen investigators. " 
And this actually fits with another interesting theory about what ' s happening in authoritarian states and in their cyberspace.
I ' ll just give you a very short list of reasons why authoritarian deliberation may actually help the dictators.
So encouraging people to actually go online and share information and data on blogs and wikis is great because otherwise , low level apparatchiks and bureaucrats will continue concealing what ' s actually happening in the country , right ? 
You put it on the front page of your blog.
Because what happens is that then you can actually point to this initiative and say ,  " Well , we are having a democracy . We are having a forum. " 
So having people involved in planning for 2020 is not necessarily going to change anything , because the dictators are still the ones who control the agenda.
In the past it would take you weeks , if not months , to identify how Iranian activists connect to each other.
But I think the biggest conceptual pitfall that cybertopians made is when it comes to digital natives , people who have grown up online.
That ' s not an option being considered too strongly.
So it does play a social role , however it may not necessarily lead to political engagement.
So this is something you have to recognize.
So I think we should shatter some of our utopian assumptions and actually start doing something about it.
culture,global issues,men,women
Growing up as a boy , we were taught that men had to be tough , had to be strong , had to be courageous , dominating -- no pain , no emotions , with the exception of anger -- and definitely no fear ; that men are in charge , which means women are not ; that men lead , and you should just follow and do what we say ; that men are superior ; women are inferior ; that men are strong ; women are weak ; that women are of less value , property of men , and objects , particularly sexual objects.
But at the same time , there ' s some stuff that ' s just straight up twisted , and we really need to begin to challenge , look at it and really get in the process of deconstructing , redefining , what we come to know as manhood.
There was a period of time when my wife -- her name is Tammie -- and I , we just got real busy and whip , bam , boom : Kendall and Jay.
Now Kendall on the other hand -- and like I said , he ' s only 15 months older than her -- he ' d come to me crying , it ' s like as soon as I would hear him cry , a clock would go off.
Tell me what ' s wrong . I can ' t understand you.
Sit down , get yourself together and come back and talk to me when you can talk to me like a -- "  what ? 
What am I doing ?  Why would I do this ?  " 
My brother , Henry , he died tragically when we were teenagers.
And the limousine empties out.
The thing that sticks with me the most is that he was apologizing to me for crying in front of me , and at the same time , he was also giving me props , lifting me up , for not crying.
No , the boy said to me -- the boy said to me ,  " It would destroy me. " 
At this time we ' re living in the Bronx , and in the building next to where I lived there was a guy named Johnny.
He was the kind of kid who parents would have to wonder ,  " What is this 16-year-old boy doing with these 12-year-old boys ?  " 
He was being raised by his grandmother.
But I ' ve got to tell you , we young guys , we looked up to this dude , man.
We all looked up to him.
 " Hey Anthony , come on upstairs. " 
Now I immediately knew what he meant.
We don ' t talk about that as men.
The other thing I couldn ' t tell him is that I didn ' t want any.
So , like my mother would say , make a long story short , I just simply said to Johnny ,  " Yes. " 
She ' s nude.
Well actually , he raped her , but he would say he had sex with her.
Folks , I ' m petrified.
So now there ' s a living room full of guys.
But I knew I felt bad about what was happening.
We see that as an equation that equals violence against women.
So we ' re very much a part of the solution as well as the problem.
I need you on board . I need you with me.
Thank you folks.

And I just don ' t think that ' s what India ' s all about , or should be all about.
If it ' s population , we ' re on course to top the charts.
The Americans have even recognized it , in an agreement.
And so I wondered , could what the future beckons for India to be all about be a combination of these things allied to something else , the power of example , the attraction of India ' s culture , what , in other words , people like to call  " soft power. " 
The Beijing Olympics were an exercise in Chinese soft power.
And in the information era we all live in today , what we might call the TED age , I ' d say that countries are increasingly being judged by a global public that ' s been fed on an incessant diet of Internet news , of televised images , of cellphone videos , of email gossip.
India has more all-news TV channels than any country in the world , in fact in most of the countries in this part of the world put together.
I think you ' ve already heard the figures.
In fact , those 15 million cellphones are the most connections that any country , including the U.S . and China , has ever established in the history of telecommunications.
If you were lucky enough to be a wealthy businessman or an influential journalist , or a doctor or something , you might have a telephone.
But half the time we would pick it up with an expectant look on our faces , there would be no dial tone.
Or you could pay eight times the going rate for something called a lightning call.
Now , fast-forward to today and this is what you see : the 15 million cell phones a month.
He ' s carrying a cell phone because most incoming calls are free , and that ' s how he gets orders from the neighborhood , to know where to collect clothes to get them ironed.
And he whipped out his cellphone , dialed the number , and a voice said ,  " I ' m up here. " 
Farmers now , who used to have to spend half a day of backbreaking labor to find out if the market town was open , if the market was on , whether the product they ' d harvested could be sold , what price they ' d fetch.
And that transformation is part of where India is heading today.
And the second goat says ,  " No , the book was better. " 
She ' s illiterate , so she can ' t read the French subtitles.
Afghanistan , we know what a serious security problem Afghanistan is for so many of us in the world.
Why ?  Because that was the moment when the Indian television soap opera ,  " Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi, "  dubbed into Dari , was telecast on Tolo T.V.
Weddings were reported to be interrupted so guests could cluster around the T.V . set , and then turn their attention back to the bride and groom.
The same is true , of course -- we don ' t have time for too many more examples -- but it ' s true of our music , of our dance , of our art , yoga , ayurveda , even Indian cuisine.
But , with this increasing awareness of India , with you and with I , and so on , with tales like Afghanistan , comes something vital in the information era , the sense that in today ' s world it ' s not the side of the bigger army that wins , it ' s the country that tells a better story that prevails.
Today , people in Silicon Valley and elsewhere speak of the IITs , the Indian Institutes of Technology with the same reverence they used to accord to MIT.
But that too is transforming the Indian story around the world.
Because India has been an open society for millennia.
That ' s the Indian story.
And the next one will be even bigger , because our voting population keeps growing by 20 million a year.
All the others have been all those three.
It was essentially India being itself.
So India now is no longer the nationalism of ethnicity or language or religion , because we have every ethnicity known to mankind , practically , we ' ve every religion know to mankind , with the possible exception of Shintoism , though that has some Hindu elements somewhere.
We don ' t even have geography uniting us , because the natural geography of the subcontinent framed by the mountains and the sea was hacked by the partition with Pakistan in 1947.
That is a 21st-century story as well as an ancient one.
Now , that is the India that is emerging into the 21st century.
We can ' t really be both of those.
That ' s why India belongs at TED , and that ' s why TED belongs in India.

The Limpopo sun gets really hot in winter.
Over 2.5 billion people in the world today do not have proper access to water and sanitation.
The disease leaves eight million people permanently blind each and every year . The shocking part about it is that to avoid being infected with trachoma , all you have to do is wash your face : no medicine , no pills , no injections.
Now we need to get this thing into practice.
So after having tried to make it work in high school with the limited resources I had , I went to university , met a few people , got it into practice , and we have a fully functioning product that ' s ready to go to the market . It ' s actually available on the market.
So we packaged DryBath in these innovative little sachets.
We realized that even rich kids from the suburbs really want DryBath.
DryBath is a rich man ' s convenience and a poor man ' s lifesaver.
And another key thing that I learned a lot throughout this whole process , last year Google named me as one of the brightest young minds in the world.
biology,chemistry,disease,health,health care,medicine,science,technology
And I was pulling a molecule out of this bag.
Actually our body doesn ' t hate these.
Now , I was thinking about that and I said , you know , we ' ve got this immune response to this ridiculous molecule that we don ' t make , and we see it a lot in other animals and stuff.
I mean I could immediately tap into an immune response that was already there , where it was not going to take five or six days to develop it -- it was going to immediately attack whatever this thing was on.
And for certain bacteria we don ' t have really efficient ways to do that anymore.
So I started working with this thing , with a bunch of collaborators.
So I might be doing something dumb , just like he was doing at the time.
You can stick this to something called a DNA aptamer.
And I ' m making an aptamer that will have this attached to it.
And they had also been treated with a drug that we made that would attack anthrax in particular , and direct your immune system to it.
And they didn ' t die because they didn ' t have anthrax anymore.
Mark Roth studies suspended animation : the art of shutting down life processes and then starting them up again . It ' s wild stuff , but it ' s not science fiction . Induced by careful use of an otherwise toxic gas , suspended animation can potentially help trauma and heart attack victims survive long enough to be treated.
I ' m going to talk to you today about my work on suspended animation.
So what do I mean when I say  " suspended animation "  ? 
An example of an organism or two that happens to be quite immortal would be plant seeds or bacterial spores.
In the immortal germ line of human beings -- that is , the eggs that sit in the ovaries -- they actually sit there in a state of suspended animation for up to 50 years in the life of each woman.
You go to the pet store or the toy store , and you can buy these things.
So these ideas of suspended animation are not just about cells and weird , little organisms.
Seven hours later , still without a heartbeat , they brought her back to life , and she went on to be the head radiologist in the hospital that treated her.
There was a 65-year-old woman in Duluth , Minnesota last year that was found frozen and without a pulse in her front yard one morning in the winter , and they brought her back to life.
These are truly miraculous things that happen.
That ' s over 50 percent.
And , in fact , the animals we were working with in the lab -- these little garden worms , nematodes -- they were also dead when we exposed them to low oxygen.
We can see it in a variety of different organisms.
And so I was wondering , when we were trying to reproduce the work with the skier , that we noticed that , of course , she had no oxygen consumption , and so maybe she was in a similar state of suspended animation.
But if you have them in suspended animation , and move them into the cold , they ' re all alive.
And so we wondered : Might there be some agent that is in us , something that we make ourselves , that we might be able to regulate our own metabolic flexibility in such a way as to be able to survive when we got extremely cold , and might otherwise pass away ? 
We have , from the time we are slapped on the butt until we take our last dying breath -- that ' s when we ' re newborn to when we ' re dead -- we cannot reduce our metabolic rate below what ' s called a standard , or basal metabolic rate.
And this was a period of time when we failed tremendously.
So , one time , I was at home watching television on the couch while my wife was putting our child to bed , and I was watching a television show.
It ' s filled with this toxic gas , hydrogen sulfide.
Yet , it was used as a chemical warfare agent in World War I.
Now , it ' s post-9/11 America , and when you go into the research institute , and you say ,  " Hi.
As I said , this agent is in us , and , in fact , here ' s a curious thing , it binds to the very place inside of your cells where oxygen binds , and where you burn it , and that you do this burning to live.
So -- So , there ' s the bit about the dopamine and being a little bit , what do you call it , delusional , and you might suggest that was it.
So , it was interesting for us when we applied hydrogen sulfide to a mouse when it was also cold because what happened is the core temperature of the mouse got cold.
And here ' s the really important point.
Really . Because we had found a way to de-animate a mammal , and it didn ' t hurt it.
So , we wondered : Can we do anything useful with this capacity to control metabolic flexibility ? 
We ought to be able to lower supply to unprecedented low levels without killing the animal.
We also found out that we could subject animals to otherwise lethal blood loss , and we could save them if we gave them hydrogen sulfide.
In one model of heart attack , animals given hydrogen sulfide showed a 70 percent reduction in heart damage compared to those who got the standard of care that you and I would receive if we were to have a heart attack here today.
In fact , so low that physicians will not have to lower or dim the metabolism of people much at all to see the benefit I just mentioned , which is a wonderful thing , if you ' re thinking about adopting this.
We have to get to Phase 2 and Phase 3 . It ' s going to take us a few years.
Also , the brilliant scientists who work at my lab and also others on staff , the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle , Washington -- wonderful place to work.
So it ' s really incredible for me to be a part of this.
And then , after they get that care -- like the mouse , like the skier , like the 65-year-old woman -- they ' ll wake up.
Why are babies cute ?  Why is cake sweet ?  Philosopher Dan Dennett has answers you wouldn ' t expect , as he shares evolution ' s counterintuitive reasoning on cute , sweet and sexy things .
I’m going around the world giving talks about Darwin , and usually what I’m talking about is Darwin’s strange inversion of reasoning.
Exactly . Exactly . And it is a strange inversion.
If you answered  ' Yes '  for any of the above , give details. " 
Today , though , I’m going to talk about Darwin’s other strange inversion , which is equally puzzling at first , but in some ways just as important.
And , of course , we are amused by jokes because they are funny.
There’s nothing intrinsically sweet about honey.
Sweetness was born with the wiring which evolved.
That would be one way of doing it , but there’s a quicker way.
We became bald-bodied , oddly enough ; for one reason or another , they didn’t.
Chocolate cake is a supernormal stimulus.
And there are lots of supernormal stimuli ; chocolate cake is one.
So babies have to attract our affection and our nurturing , and they do.
This is the strange inversion.
But you have to think evolutionarily , you have to think , what hard job that has to be done -- it’s dirty work , somebody’s got to do it -- is so important to give us such a powerful , inbuilt reward for it when we succeed.
Now I’m not going to have time to spell it all out , but I’ll just say that only some kinds of debugging get the reward.
He’s a computer scientist , Reginald Adams a psychologist , and there I am , and we’re putting this together into a book.
392
And in fact , my friend and IDEO founder , David Kelley , who’s out there somewhere , studied under him at Stanford.
It’s actually got a bunch of circles on it.
So , everybody ready ?  OK . Off you go.
Yes , lot’s of laughter . Yeah , exactly.
And that’s exactly what happens every time , every time you do this with adults.
And this fear is what causes us to be conservative in our thinking.
But as they learn to become adults , they become much more sensitive to the opinions of others , and they lose that freedom and they do start to become embarrassed.
Maybe have the same kind of security to play.
And he knew that it gives us a sense of trust , and it allows us then to take the kind of creative risks that we need to take as designers.
So , whether it’s this microbus meeting room that we have in one our buildings at IDEO ; or at Pixar , where the animators work in wooden huts and decorated caves ; or at the Googleplex , where it’s famous for its [beach] volleyball courts , and even this massive dinosaur skeleton with pink flamingos on it.
So they have the slide , and they even have a fireman’s pole.
And it’s actually something that we invented a few years ago , or created a few years ago.
That’s great . If you could pass it up . Thanks , David , I appreciate it.
Thank you . All right.
So , don’t look backwards . That’s my only recommendation here.
There we go.
Some of you haven’t fired them yet.
Okay , all right . Let’s -- I suppose we ' d better...
So , ah , that was fun.
Why do we have them ?  Well , as I said , we have them because we think maybe playfulness is important.
Helps us do our jobs better , and helps us feel better when we do them.
I suspect , actually , that the evolutionary biologists probably have lots of reasons [for] why we want to categorize new things very , very quickly.
Well , at least , we did once.
Well , not necessarily.
And you know , the more creative of them might get to a really interesting example.
We’ve all told stories about how , on Christmas morning , our kids end up playing with the boxes far more than they play with the toys that are inside them.
So again , this is another one of those playful activities that , as we get older , we tend to forget and we have to relearn.
So it should look like this . You should be looking at something like this.
So , everybody ready ?  OK ?  Off you go.
Keep your hands up if you did 10.
Happy face ?  Sad face ?  Sleepy face ?  Anybody do that ? 
I just wanted you to fill in as many circles as possible.
And in some cases , our desire to be original is actually a form of editing.
Anybody know what this is ?  It’s the peyote cactus.
So he picked 27 professionals -- they were engineers , physicists , mathematicians , architects , furniture designers even , artists -- and he asked them to come along one evening , and to bring a problem with them that they were working on.
It’s basically the same thing as the 30 circles thing that I just had you do.
And so , some of the things that they figured out , some of these individuals figured out ; in one case , a new commercial building and designs for houses that were accepted by clients ; a design of a solar space probe experiment ; a redesign of the linear electron accelerator ; an engineering improvement to a magnetic tape recorder -- you can tell this is a while ago ; the completion of a line of furniture ; and even a new conceptual model of the photon.
We need to ask some of the CEOs whether they were involved in this mescaline experiment.
Edicts like ,  " Defer judgment, "  or  " Go for quantity. " 
And we’ve certainly learnt that over time , you get much better brainstorming , much more creative outcomes when everybody does play by the rules.
They were exploring following what was interesting to them.
And of course , they used experimentation in all aspects of their work , from films to buildings , from games to graphics.
And building is the next of the behaviors that I thought I’d talk about.
And as they repeatedly knock it down and start again , learning is happening as a sort of by-product of play.
On one of his earliest projects , the team was kind of stuck , and they came up with a mechanism by hacking together a prototype made from a roll-on deodorant.
They were meeting with them ; they were talking to the surgeons about what it was they needed with this device.
And in the end it turned into a real device.
But the important idea is that everything’s at hand , everything’s around.
And then the sad thing is , although preschools are full of this kind of stuff , as kids go through the school system it all gets taken away.
This is a nurse using a very simple -- as you can see -- plasticine prototype , explaining what she wants out of a portable information system to a team of technologists and designers that are working with her in a hospital.
Something like a service or an experience ? 
And I think the best way to achieve that , and get a feeling for any flaws in your design , is to act it out.
And this is another example in a healthcare environment of some doctors and some nurses and designers acting out a service scenario around patient care.
Research into kids '  behavior actually suggests that it’s worth taking role-playing seriously.
So when , as adults , we role-play , then we have a huge set of these scripts already internalized.
Another way for us , as designers , to explore role-play is to put ourselves through an experience which we’re designing for , and project ourselves into an experience.
Now , this is a real hospital , in a real emergency room.
And also , the amazing thing about this video -- as soon as you see it you immediately project yourself into that experience.
And so sometimes these analogous experiences , analogous role-play , can also be quite valuable.
We’re trying on these experiences.
In short , we admire their willingness to play.
The first thing to remember is that play is not anarchy.
So , remember the sketching task we did at the beginning ? 
That framework of rules would have turned an embarrassing , difficult situation into a fun game.
They transition in and out of it , and good teachers spend a lot of time thinking about how to move kids through these experiences.
We go through a sort of generative mode , where we’re exploring many ideas ; and then we come back together again , and come back looking for that solution , and developing that solution.
And so being able to move between those modes is really quite important . So , it’s where there’s a more nuanced version view of play , I think , is required.
It’s not an either/or ; it’s an  " and. " 
They include exploration , which is about going for quantity ; building , and thinking with your hands ; and role-play , where acting it out helps us both to have more empathy for the situations in which we’re designing , and to create services and experiences that are seamless and authentic.

So we do everything that leads up to success , but then we get there . We figure we ' ve made it , we sit back in our comfort zone , and we actually stop doing everything that made us successful.
But then I stopped , because I figured ,  " Oh , you know , I made it.
I don ' t need to improve any more. " 
And the only thing that came was creative block.
And suddenly I was on the phone to my stockbroker and my real estate agent , when I should have been talking to my clients.
But I ' m a guy ; I knew how to fix it.
So I went to my doctor . I said ,  " Doc , I can buy anything I want . But I ' m not happy . I ' m depressed.
And he put me on anti-depressants.
So they took their money and their projects to others who would serve them better.
And that was great.
But it wasn ' t a quick trip.
And I woke up one day and I said ,  " I don ' t need Prozac anymore. " 
It ' s a continuous journey.

Eric Whitacre : A virtual choir 2,000 voices strong
This was in the late  ' 80s.
And I grew up in this little farming town in northern Nevada.
And I said ,  " Yes , I would love to do that . It sounds great. " 
At the end of the semester , we ' re taking a trip to Mexico , all expenses paid.
They opened their scores , the conductor gave the downbeat , and boom , they launched into the Kyrie from the  " Requiem "  by Mozart.
And there were a lot of cute girls in the soprano section , as it turns out.
And then I started conducting , and I ended up doing my master ' s degree at the Juilliard School.
Britlin Losee : Hi Mr . Eric Whitacre.
♫ If there are noises ♫ ♫ in the night ♫ Eric Whitacre : I was thunderstruck.
And I had this idea : if I could get 50 people to all do this same thing , sing their parts -- soprano , alto , tenor and bass -- wherever they were in the world , post their videos to YouTube , we could cut it all together and create a virtual choir.
And I made free the download of the music to a piece that I had written in the year 2000 called  " Lux Aurumque, "  which means  " light and gold. " 
Afterwards , I played a piano track underneath so that the singers would have something to listen to.
Stephen Hanson from Sweden.
I was told later , and also by lots of singers who were involved in this , that they sometimes recorded 50 or 60 different takes until they got just the right take -- they uploaded it.
And from the crowd emerged this young man , Scott Haines.
And Scott aggregated all of the videos.
This is  " Lux Aurumque "  sung by the Virtual Choir.
I actually was moved to tears when I first saw it.
And because of that , then a lot of singers started saying ,  " All right , what ' s Virtual Choir 2.0 ?  " 
And some younger members.
This is Beau Awtin.
That ' s the number for us to beat. " 
And I ' ve just chosen a few of them here.
I love the idea that she ' s singing with her sister.
Me too.
As I am in the Great Alaskan Bush , satellite is my connection to the world. " 
And the second is that people seem to be experiencing an actual connection.
I feel a closeness to this choir -- almost like a family.
You can imagine , with 2,000 synchronized YouTube videos , the render time is just atrocious.
This is  " Sleep, "  the Virtual Choir.
Biologist Sheila Patek talks about her work measuring the feeding strike of the mantis shrimp , one of the fastest movements in the animal world , using video cameras recording at 20,000 frames per second.
If you ' d like to learn how to play the lobster , we have some here.
This is a recording I made of a mantis shrimp that ' s found off the coast of California.
And so today I ' ll talk about the extreme stomatopod strike , work that I ' ve done in collaboration with Wyatt Korff and Roy Caldwell.
So , a quick strike like that . And if we slow it down a bit , this is the mantis shrimp -- the same species -- recorded at 1,000 frames a second , played back at 15 frames per second.
So , I ' ll play it one more time.
And today I ' ll talk about the smashing type of strike.
Every single high-speed video system in the biology department at Berkeley wasn ' t fast enough to catch this movement.
And so we struck up a deal.
And low light is a critical issue with filming animals , because if it ' s too high , you fry them.
I hope there aren ' t any snail rights activists around here.
And so what we did is , we took a look at these videos , and we measured how fast the limb was moving to get back to that original question.
In fact , it ' s so fast we were able to add a new point on the extreme animal movement spectrum.
And actually , this work was done in the 1960s by a famous biologist named Malcolm Burrows.
And once the muscle ' s contracted completely , everything ' s stored up -- the latch flies upward , and you ' ve got the movement.
This was how mantis shrimps make these very fast strikes.
It just looks like a saddle you ' d put on a horse.
And then we did a series of calculations , and what we were able to show is that these mantis shrimp have to have a spring.
And I ' ll just do that one more time.
The saddle-shaped structure is also known as a  " hyperbolic paraboloid surface, "  or an  " anticlastic surface. " 
It ' s also known to quite a few people who make jewelry , because it requires very little material to build this type of surface , and it ' s very strong.
It ' s two and a half inches thick , and supported at two points.
So , very interesting parallels between the biological and the engineering worlds . And interestingly , this turns out -- the stomatopod saddle turns out to be the first described biological hyperbolic paraboloid spring.
A load cell measures forces , and this is actually a piezoelectronic load cell that has a little crystal in it.
And we were able to get some force measurements out.
So these are actually some old data where I had to find the smallest animals in the lab , and we were able to measure forces of well over 100 pounds generated by an animal about this big.
And again , that brings us back to the importance of that spring in storing up and releasing so much energy in this system.
And this is just very simple -- time is on the X-axis and the force is on the Y-axis . And you can see two peaks.
So now , you ' d expect a second peak for other reasons , but not half a millisecond later.
And what I ' d like you to do in this shot is keep your eye on this , on the surface of the load cell , as the limb comes flying through.
And what that is , is cavitation.
And so here it is in the stomatopod . And again , this is a situation where engineers are very familiar with this phenomenon , because it destroys boat propellers.
You can see it coming in , and an incredible flash of light , and all this cavitation spreading over the surface of the snail.
So to solve this quandary of the two force peaks : what I think was going on is : that first impact is actually the limb hitting the load cell , and the second impact is actually the collapse of the cavitation bubble.
Because obviously , if it ' s breaking snails , the poor limb must be disintegrating . And indeed it does.
So , I ' d like to end on sort of a wacky note.
And this is quite interesting , to find evolutionary origins of visual signals on what ' s really , in all species , their spring.
This is for real . And what they do is , up until that time period when they can ' t strike , they become really obnoxious and awful , and they strike everything in sight ; it doesn ' t matter who or what.
And so I ' m very curious about whether those colored dots in the center of the saddles are conveying some kind of information about their ability to strike , or their strike force , and something about the time period in the molting cycle.
http://www.ted.com/talks/graham_hawkes_flies_through_the_ocean.html
Graham Hawkes flies through the ocean
And when you listen to some of the presentations here -- and the extraordinary range of human capability , our understandings -- and then you contrast it with the fact we still call this planet ,  " Earth: "  it’s pretty extraordinary -- we have one foot in the dark ages.
This is an ocean planet.
It seems to me that we’re all pointed in the wrong direction.
If I held up a square that was one foot square and the color of earth , and I held up another square that was the root two square -- so it’s 1.5 times bigger -- and was the color of the oceans ; and I said , what is the relative value of these two things ? 
Now , you’re not as thick as two short planks , but you sound like it when you say  " Earth, "  because that demonstration , if I turned around this way -- that earth plane would be as thin as paper.
It turns out that something more than 94 percent of life on earth is aquatic.
If this is an ocean planet and we only have a small minority of this planet , it just interferes with a lot of what humanity thinks.
It features two of these deep rovers , and I can criticize them because these sweet things are mine.
It generates all of the buoyancy , all of the payload for the craft , and the batteries are down here hanging underneath , exactly like a balloon.
It actually is a very good working sub -- that’s what it was designed for.
A seat works in a two-dimensional world , where gravity blasts down on that seat , OK ? 
This planet has an inner atmosphere of water ; it’s its inner atmosphere . It has two atmospheres -- a lesser , outer gaseous atmosphere , a lighter one.
They don’t . Their mothers don’t say to little baby fish ,  " Careful you don’t fall over. " 
And we’re only just beginning to grasp it.
What we need to do is go down into the ocean with the freedom of the animals , and move in this three-dimensional space.
She has twice the wingspan that I do.
Chris asked us to show stuff that hasn’t been shown before.
I’m trying to do everything very gently.
So now I try and go after her , but I’m practicing flying.
And then by moving through the water it’s able to take that control.
It took 10 years to build.
But look here . Instead of blowing tanks and coming up slowly without thinking about it , it’s a little bit of back pressure , and that sub just comes straight back up out of the water.
This is a wide-angle camera.
 " This is an incredible encounter with a manta . I’m speechless.
It was the fact she was going so slow.
And so what we needed to do was increase the wing area so that we just had more grip , develop higher forces.
So we opened the world’s first flight school.
So Bob Gelfond ' s around here -- but somebody in the audience here has license number 20.
What comes next in 30 seconds ?  I can’t tell you.
So anybody who wants to copy us and come and join us , go for it.
Architect Kate Orff sees the oyster as an agent of urban change . Bundled into beds and sunk into city rivers , oysters slurp up pollution and make legendarily dirty waters clean -- thus driving even more innovation in  " oyster-tecture. "  Orff shares her vision for an urban landscape that links nature and humanity for mutual benefit.
I am passionate about the American landscape and how the physical form of the land , from the great Central Valley of California to the bedrock of Manhattan , has really shaped our history and our character.
This graph represents what we ' re dealing with now in the built environment.
So the era of big infrastructure is over.
So we need new stories , new heroes and new tools.
So the oyster was the basis for a manifesto-like urban design project that I did about the New York Harbor called  " oyster-tecture. " 
If you look here at this map , showing everything in blue is out in the water , and everything in yellow is upland.
There are problems of sewage overflow and contamination , but I would also argue that almost every city has this exact condition , and it ' s a condition that we ' re all facing.
And you can see from this map , there ' s this incredible geographical signature of a series of islands that were out in the harbor and a matrix of salt marshes and beaches that served as natural wave attenuation for the upland settlement.
One is to develop a new artificial ecology , a reef out in the harbor , that would then protect new settlement patterns inland and the Gowanus.
And again , it ' s this incredibly exciting animal.
They were key in our culture and our economy.
Finally , oysters can attenuate and agglomerate onto each other and form these amazing natural reef structures.
So we were inspired by the oyster , but I was also inspired by the life cycle of the oyster.
How does the reef work ?  Well , it ' s very , very simple.
What is fuzzy rope , you ask ? 
The concept was to really knit this rope together and develop this new soft infrastructure for the oysters to grow on.
In the end , what we realized we were making was a new blue-green watery park for the next watery century -- an amphibious park , if you will.
So you can imagine a sort of new manner of living with a new relationship with the water , and also a hybridizing of recreational and science programs in terms of monitoring.
You can see the eight chambers on the side host little baby oysters and essentially force-feed them.
New word.
One is : why isn ' t it happening now ? 
To conclude , this is just one cross-section of one piece of city , but my dream is , my hope is , that when you all go back to your own cities that we can start to work together and collaborate on remaking and reforming a new urban landscape towards a more sustainable , a more livable and a more delicious future.

No , what I want to do is take you back to 1854 in London for the next few minutes , and tell the story -- in brief -- of this outbreak , which in many ways , I think , helped create the world that we live in today , and particularly the kind of city that we live in today.
And so the Victorians were trying to live through and simultaneously invent a whole new scale of living : this scale of living that we , you know , now call  " metropolitan living. " 
And they would just kind of throw the buckets down there and hope that it would somehow go away , and of course it never really would go away.
So , you would just walk around London at this point and just be overwhelmed with this stench.
And so the authorities became convinced that this smell was this problem.
So what ended up happening , actually , is they ended up increasing the outbreaks of cholera because , as we now know , cholera is actually in the water.
So this was the state of London in 1854 , and in the middle of all this carnage and offensive conditions , and in the midst of all this scientific confusion about what was actually killing people , it was a very talented classic 19th century multi-disciplinarian named John Snow , who was a local doctor in Soho in London , who had been arguing for about four or five years that cholera was , in fact , a waterborne disease , and had basically convinced nobody of this.
And Snow labored for a long time with this great insight that everybody ignored.
And so this little girl inadvertently ended up contaminating the water in this popular pump , and one of the most terrifying outbreaks in the history of England erupted about two or three days later.
Just an extraordinary , terrifying scene.
And so he went right in there and started interviewing people.
He found increasingly that people who drank from the pump were getting sick.
And so he created this map , which basically ended up representing all the deaths in the neighborhoods as black bars at each address.
And so you can see this something poisonous emanating out of this pump that you could see in a glance.
And that was the last time that London has seen a cholera outbreak since.
When people were looking at 10 percent of their neighborhoods dying in the space of seven days , there was a widespread consensus that this couldn ' t go on , that people weren ' t meant to live in cities of 2.5 million people.
It ' s a map of deaths that ended up creating a whole new way of life , the life that we ' re enjoying here today . Thank you very much.

He went on to say that every two weeks , an elder goes to the grave carrying the last spoken word of that culture.
What I ' d like to do right now is share some of those stories with you.
And when I met her , she had just taken a walk over the Himalayas from Lhasa , the capital of Tibet , into Nepal , across to India -- 30 days -- to meet her leader , the Dalai Lama.
This is Paldin.
And he was beaten , starved , tortured -- lost all his teeth while in prison.
And it just so happened , on the fifth week , there was a public teaching by the Dalai Lama.
So , two months later , I went into Tibet , and I started interviewing the people there , taking my photographs . That ' s what I do.
And I ' d snuck in -- because it ' s totally illegal to have a picture of the Dalai Lama in Tibet -- it ' s the quickest way you can get arrested.
So I was going in , interviewing these people and doing their portraits.
And they had just come down from the high pastures , at 18,000 feet.
At the age of four , he was installed as the 14th Dalai Lama.
And if you think about this man , 46 years later , still sticking to this non-violent response to a severe political and human rights issue.
So this is our icon to non-violence in our world -- one of our living icons.
And this area of the Ecuadorian Amazon -- oil was discovered in 1972.
And we spent -- I was with a team -- two weeks with these guys out in the jungle watching them hunt.
And I couldn ' t even see the monkeys that they were getting with these darts.
And these people are the people who take the brunt of it.
And I was -- I usually travel alone when I do my work , but I did this -- I hosted a program for Discovery , and when I went down with the team , I was quite concerned about going in with a whole bunch of people , especially into the Huaorani , deep into the Huaorani tribe.
I wanted him to get an experience in the Islamic world and I also wanted him to -- I was going there to work with a group , do a story on a group called the Kalash , that are a group of animists , 3,000 animists , that live -- very small area -- surrounded by Islam -- there ' s 3,000 of these Kalash left ; they ' re incredible people.
By the way , Mengatoue was the shaman of his tribe as well.
And we watched and stayed with John Doolikahn.
You know , getting kids used to different realities , I think , is so important . What Dan Dennett said the other day -- having a curriculum where they study different religions , just to make a mental flexibility , give them a mental flexibility in different belief systems -- I think this is so necessary in our world today as you see these clash of beliefs taking place.
We now have 15 sites.
And this is -- I see this rolling out all over -- this is our site in Ollantaytambo , Peru , four years ago , where they first saw their first computers ; now they have computers in their classrooms.
And the way we do it is , we do it in workshops , and we bring people who want to learn digital workflow and storytelling , and have them work with the kids.
We have the website , where the kids all get their homepage.
And if you get a chance , you can go to our website , and you ' ll see the incredible work these kids do.
National Geographic just did a Roper Study of 18 to 26 year olds in our country and in nine other industrialized countries.
And this is a study that was just done a couple of years ago.
And this kid lived in the village -- he wasn ' t there at the time -- and this is the little movie he put together about that.
At Serious Play 2008 , astrophysicist George Smoot shows stunning new images from deep-space surveys , and prods us to ponder how the cosmos -- with its giant webs of dark matter and mysterious gaping voids -- got built this way.
I thought I would think about changing your perspective on the world a bit , and showing you some of the designs that we have in nature.
And so the question is : how did that material get here ? 
What was the whole process in the creation and the evolution of the universe to getting to the point that we have these kinds of materials ? 
This is a star , this is a star , everything else is a galaxy , OK ? 
But one of the questions is -- this should be , to you -- how come there are so many galaxies ? 
It ' s a very large number of galaxies.
And then I ' m going to show you it ' s actually a lot more complicated.
Put the Earth at the center of the nested spheres , just because that ' s where we ' re making observations.
You ' d like to have a little advance warning.
So if you take a picture of what ' s going on , it ' s 10 years ago.
I mean , it just gives you the scale.
There ' s the galaxy in the middle , which is the Milky Way , and around that are the Hubble -- you know , nearby kind of galaxies , and there ' s a sphere that marks the different times.
And then there ' s a part of the universe we can ' t see because it ' s so dense and so hot , light can ' t escape.
The universe is almost a perfect sphere , but there are these very tiny variations which we show here in great exaggeration.
So there was the COBE satellite , which was launched in 1989 , and we discovered these variations.
And what we saw was , we saw these variations , and then they told us the secrets , both about the structure of space-time , and about the contents of the universe , and about how the universe started in its original motions.
And it ' s maturing up to the present time.
What kind of evidence do we have for that ? 
So here is the Sloan Digital Sky Survey showing the location of a million galaxies.
And you see these structures , this thing we call the Great Wall , but there are voids and those kinds of stuff , and they kind of fade out because the telescope isn ' t sensitive enough to do it.
So the next picture shows you the three-dimensional version of this rotating around.
There are places where there are no galaxies and there are places where there are thousands of galaxies clumped together , right.
There ' s another survey which is very similar to this , called the Two-degree Field of View Galaxy Redshift Survey.
It ' s hard to see the pattern in the middle of the audience , it ' s hard to see the pattern of this.
But you can see the voids , you can see the complicated structure , and you say , well , how did this happen ? 
There ' s a more complicated process going on here.
So if that ' s your responsibility , how are you going to do that ? 
And that is , you start out with very simple ingredients and some simple rules , but you have to have enough ingredients to make it complicated.
And we had to add one more thing to make the universe come out right.
So the stuff that ' s in this picture that ' s white , that is the dark matter.
So this -- we ' re going to zoom in.
And when a number of filaments come together in a knot , that makes a supercluster of galaxies.
So we ' re zooming in.
A parsec is 3.26 light years.
That ' s the distance between us and Andromeda , right ? 
There ' s a very simple fluid to begin with.
Here you ' re looking across one percent of the volume of the visible universe and you ' re seeing billions of galaxies , right , and nodes , but you realize they ' re not even the main structure.
You see a filament , you see the light is the invisible matter , and the yellow is the stars or the galaxies showing up.
It ' s only when you look at it at a very large scale , and explore it and so forth , you realize it ' s a very intricate , complicated kind of a design , right ? 
That ' s the issue , right ? 
This is how , if you took billions of years to go around , it might look to you , right ? 
It started with tiny quantum mechanical fluctuations , but expanding at a tremendous rate.
This simulation was run on 1,000 processors for a month in order to make just this simple visible one.
And this is a simple one , because it doesn ' t have the ordinary matter and it just has the dark matter in it.
The fluctuations are a part in 100,000.
But the distances on the universe are so large and the time scales are so large that it takes a long time for this to form.
So we ' re able to do the simulation , but this is two days on a desktop.
And that design is sort of way beyond what our original imagination ever was.
And on the bottom right is if the satellite had flipped upside down and mapped the Earth , what kind of a map we would have got of the Earth.
Geology has these effects , which is moving the plates around and so forth.
Give you a different view about what the design and what everything else looks like.
1640
So with that in mind , I ' d like you just to take a moment to think , when did you last take any time to do nothing ? 
Simply doing nothing.
We ' re talking about our mind.
In fact , we spend more time looking after our cars , our clothes and our hair than we — okay , maybe not our hair , but you see where I ' m going.
That ' s really not how it has to be.
Now as I was there , I guess , like a lot of people , I assumed that it was just an aspirin for the mind.
It was a really very stressful time.
Some people hit the bottle , start taking medication.
Well , obviously it changed things.
By that I mean not being lost in thought , not being distracted , not being overwhelmed by difficult emotions , but instead learning how to be in the here and now , how to be mindful , how to be present.
Forty-seven percent.
But we need to know how to do it.
But we also need to know how to approach it in the right way to get the best from it.
Equally , if I relax too much talking to you , then there ' s no way I can focus on the balls . I ' m going to drop them.
Of course in meditation — — we ' re going to end up falling asleep.
So everything ' s going fine , and then we see the anxious thought , and it ' s like ,  " Oh , didn ' t realize I was worried about that. " 
You know , this is crazy . We do this all the time , even on an everyday level.
It does hurt . And we reinforce the storyline , right ? 
Don ' t be surprised if you feel a bit agitated in your body when you sit down to do nothing and your mind feels like that.
We can ' t change every little thing that happens to us in life , but we can change the way that we experience it.

Sherry Turkle : Connected , but alone ? 
Getting that text was like getting a hug.
Actually that reminder of my daughter brings me to the beginning of my story.
We were exploring different aspects of ourselves.
Now fast-forward to 2012.
And I ' ve just written a new book , but this time it ' s not one that will get me on the cover of Wired magazine.
And what I ' ve found is that our little devices , those little devices in our pockets , are so psychologically powerful that they don ' t only change what we do , they change who we are.
People talk to me about the important new skill of making eye contact while you ' re texting.
This is a recent shot of my daughter and her friends being together while not being together.
Why does this matter ? 
People want to customize their lives.
But you can end up hiding from each other , even as we ' re all constantly connected to each other.
But then he stops himself and he says ,  " You know , I ' m not telling you the truth.
I call it the Goldilocks effect : not too close , not too far , just right.
People say ,  " I ' ll tell you what ' s wrong with having a conversation.
We get to edit , and that means we get to delete , and that means we get to retouch , the face , the voice , the flesh , the body -- not too little , not too much , just right.
We short-change ourselves.
My answer was no , they don ' t add up.
For kids growing up , that skill is the bedrock of development.
I believe this wish reflects a painful truth that I ' ve learned in the past 15 years.
We ' re developing robots , they call them sociable robots , that are specifically designed to be companions -- to the elderly , to our children , to us.
It seemed to be looking in her eyes.
But that woman was trying to make sense of her life with a machine that had no experience of the arc of a human life.
So during that moment when that woman was experiencing that pretend empathy , I was thinking ,  " That robot can ' t empathize.
But when I stepped back , I felt myself at the cold , hard center of a perfect storm.
And we are vulnerable.
But we ' re not so comfortable.
And that third idea , that we will never have to be alone , is central to changing our psyches.
And so people try to solve it by connecting.
It ' s shaping a new way of being.
Now it ' s : I want to have a feeling , I need to send a text.
But in the process , we set ourselves up to be isolated.
When we don ' t have the capacity for solitude , we turn to other people in order to feel less anxious or in order to feel alive.
But we ' re at risk , because actually it ' s the opposite that ' s true.
And that ' s what I ' m calling for here , now : reflection and , more than that , a conversation about where our current use of technology may be taking us , what it might be costing us.
We grew up with digital technology and so we see it as all grown up.
I see some first steps.
Create sacred spaces at home -- the kitchen , the dining room -- and reclaim them for conversation.
Most important , we all really need to listen to each other , including to the boring bits.
We have everything we need to start.
So in my work , I hear that life is hard , relationships are filled with risk.
We ' re drawn to virtual romance , to computer games that seem like worlds , to the idea that robots , robots , will someday be our true companions.
They need us.
culture,education,leadership,life,poetry,sports,work
But they weren ' t satisfied when their own -- would make the teacher feel that they had failed , or the youngster had failed.
If you won them all , you were considered to be reasonably successful -- not completely . Because I found out -- we had a number of years at UCLA where we didn ' t lose a game.
And I wanted to come up with something that I hoped could make me a better teacher , and give the youngsters under my supervision -- whether it be in athletics or in the English classroom -- something to which to aspire , other than just a higher mark in the classroom , or more points in some athletic contest.
And I recalled -- I was raised on a small farm in Southern Indiana and Dad tried to teach me and my brothers that you should never try to be better than someone else.
Then I ran across this simple verse that said ,  " At God ' s footstool to confess , a poor soul knelt , and bowed his head.
And I don ' t think others can judge that . I think it ' s like character and reputation.
Well , that was my idea that I was going to try to get across to the youngsters.
Nor all the books on all the shelves -- it ' s what the teachers are themselves. " 
Maybe it ' s because Dad used to read to us at night.
And she -- after some time , she said she wanted to think about that.
And all about a gathering of teachers , farmers , merchants , laborers : those who work and vote and build and plan and pray into a great tomorrow.
They ask me why I teach and I reply ,  ' Where could I find such splendid company ?  '  "  And I believe the teaching profession -- it ' s true , you have so many youngsters.
Basketball was second , because it was paying their way , and they do need a little time for social activities , but you let social activities take a little precedence over the other two and you ' re not going to have any very long.
One was -- never be late . Never be late.
So I let them -- just they had to be neat and clean.
So I was a stickler for that . I believed in that.
When I speak at coaching clinics , I often tell young coaches -- and at coaching clinics , more or less , they ' ll be the younger coaches getting in the profession.
And that ' s not good , for a young married man to go home in a bad mood.
If I see it in a game , you ' re going to come out and sit on the bench.
Not like the coaches today , for gracious sakes , no.
That ' s what he tried to teach me and my brothers at one time.
And right at the top -- faith and patience.
And we get a little older -- we sort of let things go.
I believe that we must believe , truly believe . Not just give it word service ; believe that things will work out as they should , providing we do what we should.
You know a number of years ago , there was a Major League Baseball umpire by the name of George Moriarty.
You ' d be surprised how many also told him that that was one more than he had in his head at various times.
You and I know deeper down , there ' s always a chance to win the crown.
Giving all , it seems to me , is not so far from victory.
Don ' t whine . Don ' t complain . Don ' t make excuses.
Never mention winning . My idea is that you can lose when you outscore somebody in a game.
I used to say that when a game is over , and you see somebody that didn ' t know the outcome , I hope they couldn ' t tell by your actions whether you outscored an opponent or the opponent outscored you.
And as time went by , and I learned more about other things , I think it worked a little better , as far as the results . But I wanted the score of a game to be the byproduct of these other things , and not the end itself.
I liked our -- as a basketball coach at UCLA I liked our practices to be the journey , and the game would be the end . The end result.
I can never answer that , as far as the individuals are concerned.
I ' d want one to realize that defense usually wins championships , and would work hard on defense.
I ' ve had some that could and wouldn ' t , and I ' ve had some that would and couldn ' t.
And why not just take someone like Keith Wilkes and let it go at that.
When I saw them as freshmen , on our freshmen team -- we didn ' t have -- freshmen couldn ' t play varsity when I taught.
And here I thought he ' d never play a minute , when he was -- so those are the things that give you great joy , and great satisfaction to see one.
I ' ve had too many that stand around and wait to see if it ' s missed , then they go and it ' s too late.
So they had qualities that -- they came close to -- as close to reaching possibly their full potential as any players I ever had.

There ' s actually a major health crisis today in terms of the shortage of organs.
So this is now a public health crisis.
Or we can use cells alone , either your very own cells or different stem cell populations.
But it ' s actually not a new field.
He actually devised some of the same technologies used today for suturing blood vessels , and some of the blood vessel grafts we use today were actually designed by Alexis.
And that really has to do to many different challenges.
We could not get enough of your cells to grow outside of your body.
But even now , 2011 , there ' s still certain cells that we just can ' t grow from the patient.
This is actually a biomaterial.
That was like the fibers of the cotton candy creating this structure , this tubularized structure , which is a biomaterial that we can then use to help your body regenerate using your very own cells to do so.
And you see that patient now six months after with an X-ray showing you the regenerated tissue , which is fully regenerated when you analyze it under the microscope.
So they know what to do.
Or if we ' re going to use larger structures to replace larger structures , we can then use the patient ' s own cells , or some cell population , and the biomaterials , the scaffolds , together.
We then place it in an oven-like device , and we ' re able to create that structure and bring it out.
We actually take a very small piece of the bladder from the patient -- less than half the size of a postage stamp.
A few weeks later , you have your engineered organ that we ' re able to implant back into the patient.
We use now some type of technologies , where for solid organs , for example , like the liver , what we do is we take discard livers.
You can hold it like a liver , but it has no cells ; it ' s just a skeleton of the liver.
Another technology that we ' ve used is actually that of printing.
And then finally you ' re able to get that structure out.
Another more advanced technology we ' re looking at right now , our next generation of technologies , are more sophisticated printers.
That ' s what you see here on the right side.
Once it ' s scanned , it sends information in the correct layers of cells where they need to be.
And this is actually new technology still under development.
Patients are dying every day because we don ' t have enough of those organs to go around.
So we go layer by layer through the organ , analyzing each layer as we go through the organ , and we then are able to send that information , as you see here , through the computer and actually design the organ for the patient.
So while we ' ve been talking today , you can actually see the printer back here in the back stage.
Put a pair of gloves here.
Has a little bit of consistency to it.
This is actually the printer that you see here onstage.
And this is actually a very brief clip -- only about 30 seconds -- of a patient who actually received an organ.
I felt so sick.
I was able to wrestle in high school.
I ' ve got it for life , so I ' m all set.
LM : Ten years ago , when I had my surgery -- and it ' s really great to see him.
But it was hard to do that when I was born with spina bifida and my kidneys and bladder weren ' t working.
LM : What I know from , he ' s working really hard in his lab and coming up with crazy stuff.
All I wanted to do was to get better , and I didn ' t realize how amazing it really was until now that I ' m older and I see the amazing things that he ' s doing.
There were a couple that were a little stubborn , but I had to talk to them.
JE : Thank you , Tony.
1037
Now I ' m going to start with a deceptively simple example.
I think it was bought for us around three years ago for a Christmas present.
Now before we go on , I have a confession to make.
Now you may have noticed there ' s a new sector emerging called swap-trading.
Lo and behold , there in Reseda , CA was Rondoron who wanted swap his or her  " like new "  copy of  " Sex and the City "  for my copy of  " 24. " 
My passion , and what I ' ve spent the last few years dedicated to researching , is the collaborative behaviors and trust-mechanics inherent in these systems.
An extremely powerful dynamic that has huge commercial and cultural implications is at play.
We ' re bartering , trading , swapping , sharing , but they ' re being reinvented into dynamic and appealing forms.
Now before I dig into the different systems of collaborative consumption , I ' d like to try and answer the question that every author rightfully gets asked , which is , where did this idea come from ? 
And linked to this crowd mania were examples all around the world -- from the election of a president to the infamous Wikipedia , and everything in between -- on what the power of numbers could achieve.
And the ubiquitous force of this peer-to-peer revolution means that sharing is happening at phenomenal rates.
And we were doing so for thousands of years , whether it ' s when we hunted in packs , or farmed in cooperatives , before this big system called hyper-consumption came along and we built these fences and created out own little fiefdoms.
So we , the millennials -- I am just a millennial -- are like foot soldiers , moving us from a culture of  " me "  to a culture of  " we. " 
Thomas Friedman is one of my favorite New York Times columnists , and he poignantly commented that 2008 is when we hit a wall , when Mother Nature and the market both said ,  " No more. " 
Well it was a lot of noise and complexity in my head , until actually I realized it was happening because of four key drivers.
And four , a global recession that has fundamentally shocked consumer behaviors.
So my co-author , Roo Rogers , and I have actually gathered thousands of examples from all around the world of collaborative consumption.
They ' re increasingly thought of as the fifth  ' R '  -- reduce , reuse , recycle , repair and redistribute -- because they stretch the life cycle of a product and thereby reduce waste.
One of my favorite examples of collaborative lifestyles is called Landshare.
It ' s one of those ideas that ' s so simple , yet brilliant , you wonder why it ' s never been done before.
And that can be anything from baby goods to fashions to -- how many of you have a power drill , own a power drill ?  Right.
So why don ' t you rent the drill , or , even better , rent out your own drill to other people and make some money from it ? 
The average car costs 8,000 dollars a year to run.
In 2009 , Zipcar took 250 participants from across 13 cities -- and they ' re all self-confessed car addicts and car-sharing rookies -- and got them to surrender their keys for a month.
It ' s amazing that 413 lbs were lost just from the extra exercise.
Just think of libraries and laundrettes.
I don ' t want the DVD ; I want the movie it carries.
This is fueling a massive shift from where usage trumps possessions -- or as Kevin Kelly , the editor of Wired magazine , puts it ,  " where access is better than ownership. " 
We ' ve gone from traditional car-ownership to car-sharing companies , such as Zipcar and GoGet , to ride-sharing platforms that match rides to the newest entry , which is peer-to-peer car rental , where you can actually make money out of renting that car that sits idle for 23 hours a day to your neighbor.
With every spammer we flag , with every idea we post , comment we share , we ' re actually signaling how well we collaborate , and whether we can or can ' t be trusted.
Now mark my words , it ' s only a matter of time before we ' re going to be able to perform a Google-like search and see a cumulative picture of our reputation capital.
I believe it will be referred to as a revolution , so to speak -- when society , faced with great challenges , made a seismic shift from individual getting and spending towards a rediscovery of collective good.
http://www.ted.com/talks/caitria_and_morgan_o_neill_how_to_step_up_in_the_face_of_disaster.html
Caitria and Morgan O’Neill : How to step up in the face of disaster
After an EF3 tornado ripped straight through our town and took parts of our roof off , I decided to stay in Massachusetts instead of pursuing the master ' s program I had moved my boxes home that afternoon for.
CO : So tornadoes don ' t happen in Massachusetts.
When we finally got out the back door , transformers were burning in the street.
So I was in the museum of science at the time the tornado hit , playing with the tornado display.
We live across the street from an historic church that had lost its very iconic steeple in the storm.
There were a couple large , sweaty men with chainsaws standing in the center of the church , but nobody knew where to send them because no one knew the extent of the damage yet.
And then armed with just two laptops and one AirCard , we built a recovery machine.
CO : Yeah , and we need a hotline . Can you make a Google Voice number ? 
We need to canvas and send out volunteers.
We don ' t need any more freezers.
MO : I can donate three water heaters , but someone needs to come pick them up.
MO : My church group of 50 would like housing and meals for a week while we repair properties.
MO : We didn ' t get our authority from the board of selectmen We just started answering questions and making decisions because someone , anyone , had to.
CO : The point is , if there ' s a flood or a fire or a hurricane , you , or somebody like you , are going to step up and start organizing things.
CO : In a country like ours where we breathe wi-fi , leveraging technology for a faster recovery should be a no-brainer.
CO : I decided to stay in the country , give up the master ' s in Moscow and to work full-time to make this happen.
This leaves local residents to deal with the thousands of spontaneous volunteers , thousands of donations , and all with no training and no tools.
Disaster relief is essentially a backwards political campaign.
And you ' ve only got about seven days to capture 50 percent of all of the Web searches that will ever be made to help your area.
And this is the curve for the Dallas tornadoes in April where we deployed software.
MO : Data.
But who knows that ? 
MO : We needed canvasing tools , donations databasing , needs reporting , remote volunteer access , all in an easy-to-use website.
And we ' ve been flying into disaster areas since this past January , setting up software , training residents and licensing the software to areas that are preparing for disasters.
All of the interest came in the first four days , but by the time they lost the news cycle , that ' s when the needs came in , yet they had this massive resource of what people were able to give and they ' ve been able to meet the needs of their residents.
So that ' s what we ' re working on.
In our hometown , we trained a half-dozen residents to run these Web tools on their own.
They have hotlines and spreadsheets and data.
We ' ve been able to see the same transformation in Texas and in Alabama.
MO : All right . Let ' s go.

This is the squatter community in Sanjay Gandhi National Park in Bombay , India , what ' s called Mumbai these days.
Now , why do I say that ? 
They ' re very polite and they don ' t get so forward so quickly.
And if you do the math , that ' s 130 people every minute.
2030 -- two billion squatters , one in four people on the planet.
Because I think it says something about reversing our perception of what we think the good life is.
Armstrong and his friends had no water -- they bought it from a nearby tap owner -- no toilet -- the families in this compound shared a single pit-latrine -- and no sewers or sanitation.
1.5 million people stuffed into mud or metal huts with no services , no toilets , no rights.
They called their landlord a Wabenzi , meaning that he is a person who has enough money to drive a Mercedes-Benz.
It was perhaps eight feet tall , 40 feet long , and 10 feet wide.
They were barefoot , and with each step their toes sank into the muck sending hundreds of flies scattering from the rancid pile.
When 20 families -- 100 people or so -- share a single latrine , a boy pooping on a garbage pile is perhaps no big thing.
 ' This place is very addictive, '  he had said.
 ' Once you have stayed here, '  he said ,  ' you can stay for the rest of your life. '  "  So , he has hope , and this is where these communities start.
This is in Rio de Janeiro , and it ' s getting a bit better , right ? 
The buildings here are multi-story.
And then you get Sultanbelyi , in Turkey , where it ' s even built to a higher level of design.
And it ' s built to a pretty high standard of design.
They ' re quite vital places , these communities.
This is a typical pathway in Rocinha called a  " beco "  -- these are how you get around the community.
And these becos are normally very crowded , and people hump furniture up them , or refrigerators up them , all sorts of things.
This is a marketplace , also in Kenya , Toi Market , lots of dealers , in almost everything you want to buy.
This here , on the right-hand side , is what ' s called a -- if you look at the fine print under the awning -- it ' s a hotel.
People tap in and they have thieves who are called  " grillos "  or  " crickets, "  and they steal the electrical power and wire the neighborhood.
And when they have more money they cement their streets , and they put in sewers and good water pipes , and stuff like that.
One is people need a guarantee they won ' t be evicted.
And they need access to politics , and that can mean two things.
One is that -- it ' s called  " gecekondu "  in Turkish , which means  " built overnight, "  and if you build your house overnight in Turkey , you can ' t be evicted without due process of law , if they don ' t catch you during the night.
So , these are the civic leaders of the future.
They ' re very outspoken . They ' re very active.
This is Richard Muthama Peter , and he is an itinerant street photographer in Kibera.
So , I think the message I take , from what I read from the book , from what Armstrong said , and from all these people , is that these are neighborhoods.

Joseph Lekuton tells a parable for Kenya
So , I walked very comfortably to this missionary school that was run by an American missionary , and the first thing the American missionary gave me was a candy.
My family moved ; we ' re nomads.
And I stayed . I don ' t know why I stayed , but I stayed.
So I got a scholarship to St . Lawrence University , Upstate New York ; finished that . And then after that I went to Harvard Graduate School ; finished that . And then I worked in DC a little bit : I wrote a book for National Geographic and taught history , U.S . history.
And every time , they sent scouts out there to make sure no one attacked them.
The leader of the chiefs said ,  " No , sorry . We can ' t take you . You ' ll slow us down.
The blind man said ,  " Look , I ' m a very strong man but I can ' t see. " 
And these guys took off , followed the footsteps of the villagers until they found and passed them.
You ' ve got a good education from America , you have a good life in America ; what are you going to do for us ? 
Every time you go to an area where for 43 years of independence , we still don ' t have basic health facilities.
So last July .. . I moved from America in June , ran in July election and won.
I ' m asking my friends from America to help with bringing nurses or doctors to help us out.
So my plan right now as I continue with introducing students to different fields -- some become doctors , some lawyers -- we want to produce a comprehensive group of people , students , who can come back and help us see a community grow that is in the middle of a huge economic recession.

A cheery thought.
For 12,000 years , the distribution of ages in the human population has looked like a pyramid , with the oldest on top.
The average lifespan’s more than doubled since 1840 , and it’s increasing currently at the rate of about five hours every day.
It will be well over a trillion dollars by 2050.
Interestingly enough , other neurologic diseases which affect very different parts of the brain also show tangles of misfolded protein , which suggests that the approach might be a general one , and might be used to cure many neurologic diseases , not just Alzheimer’s disease.
And there’s tremendous scope for additional private help here , because the government has dropped the ball on much of this , I’m afraid.
And the Avian Flu is also not a good idea.
And of course , when it comes to cognitive effects ,  " use it or lose it "  applies , so you want to stay mentally stimulated.
Because the clock is ticking for all of us.

For most of that time , I ' ve been struggling and grappling with questions about the nature of God . Who is God ? 
And in the worship of my church , the most frequently used adjective about God is  " almighty. " 
Of course , there have been thinkers who have suggested different ways of looking at God.
Finding deep resonances with other religions and philosophies and ways of looking at life as part of what is a universal and global search for meaning.
And two weeks later , Sunday morning , 9th of January , I found myself standing in front of my congregation -- intelligent , well meaning , mostly thoughtful Christian people -- and I needed to express , on their behalf , our feelings and our questions.
The essence of what he said was this : the people most affected by the devastation and loss of life do not want intellectual theories about how God let this happen.
The only appropriate response would be a compassionate silence and some kind of practical help.
We demand an explanation from God.
And if this is true , it must also be that God knows the joy and exaltation of the human spirit , as well.
Now the unchanging God feels a bit cold and indifferent to me.
And the answer was ,  " God is in this with us , or God doesn ' t deserve our allegiance anymore. " 
So we have a suffering God -- a God who is intimately connected with this world and with every living soul.
We have a pram service on Tuesday mornings for mums and their pre-school children.
In the second verse comes the line ,  " The wind and waves obey Him. " 
Does God order each moment ?  Does the wind and the waves obey Him ? 
Do we have a local God who can do little things like parking spaces , but not big things like 500 mile-per-hour waves ? 
You probably heard some of them : the man who surfed the wave , the teenage girl who recognized the danger because she had just been learning about tsunamis at school.
So the next question is about partiality.
A cosmic us and them , and a God who is guilty of the worst kind of favoritism ? 
Perhaps God allows or permits terrible things to happen , so that heroism and compassion can be shown.
We are still left with a God who can do the tsunami and allow Auschwitz.
I merely , most respectfully , return Him the ticket. " 
Or a powerless lover , watching with infinite compassion things God is unable to control or change ? 
Maybe God doesn ' t do things at all.
The people knew their God by His mighty acts.
An in-dwelling compassionate presence , underpinning and sustaining all things.
In the incredible intricacy and magnificence of the natural world.
In presence and in absence . In simplicity and complexity.
Is God just another name for the universe , with no independent existence at all ? 
If we knew , God would not be God.
By seeking the God within . By cultivating my own inwardness.
By seeking intimate connection with your inwardness.
Namaste.
It needs a profound attentiveness and a patient waiting , a contemplative attitude and a generosity and openness to those whose experience is different from my own.
I had some suggestions to make -- possible new ways of thinking about God.
Accepting his 2008 TED Prize , author Dave Eggers asks the TED community to personally , creatively engage with local public schools . With spellbinding eagerness , he talks about how his 826 Valencia tutoring center inspired others around the world to open
Thank you so much everyone from TED , and Chris and Amy in particular.
So , I ' m going to talk about sort of what we did at this organization called 826 Valencia , and then I ' m going to talk about how we all might join in and do similar things.
In the Brooklyn neighborhood that I lived in , Park Slope , there are a lot of writers -- it ' s like a very high per capita ratio of writers to normal people.
But I knew so many of the things they were up against , so many of the struggles they were dealing with.
Now , I would say ,  " Well , why don ' t you just work with them one-on-one ?  " 
You ' d have to greatly multiply the workweek and clone the teachers.
I ' m trying . That clock has got me.
And the idea was to put McSweeney ' s -- McSweeney ' s Quarterly , that we published twice or three times a year , and a few other magazines -- we were going to move it into an office for the first time.
So the idea was that we would be working on whatever we ' re working on , at 2:30 p.m . the students flow in and you put down what you ' re doing , or you trade , or you work a little bit later or whatever it is.
And everything was great except the landlord said ,  " Well , the space is zoned for retail ; you have to come up with something.
And we couldn ' t think of anything necessarily to sell , but we did all the necessary research.
And so this is what we did . So it made everybody laugh , and we said ,  " There ' s a point to that.
Here you see planks sold by the foot and we have supplies to combat scurvy.
This is replacement eyes in case you lose one.
It became mop heads . And this is the fish theater , which is just a saltwater tank with three seats , and then right behind it we set up this space , which was the tutoring center.
We had tables , chairs , computers , everything.
And we sat . And at 2:30 p.m . we put a sandwich board out on the front sidewalk and it just said ,  " Free Tutoring for Your English-Related and Writing-Related Needs -- Just Come In , It ' s All Free. " 
And then somebody alerted us to the fact that maybe there was a trust gap , because we were operating behind a pirate supply store.
Immediately , she made the inroads with the teachers and the parents and the students and everything , and so suddenly it was actually full every day.
And so most of these students , English is not spoken in the home.
If you ' re on Valencia Street within those few blocks at around 2 p.m. , 2:30 p.m. , you will get run over , often , by the kids and their big backpacks , or whatever , actually running to this space , which is very strange , because it ' s school , in a way.
First of all , it was a pirate supply store , which is insane.
They go in , and they might be working with a high school student actually working on a novel -- because we had very gifted kids , too.
These adults , they ' re working in their field.
But you know , there ' s something about the kids finishing their homework in a given day , working one-on-one , getting all this attention -- they go home , they ' re finished . They don ' t stall.
A bunch of happy families in a neighborhood is a happy community.
So we started off with about 12 volunteers , and then we had about 50 , and then a couple hundred.
So we said ,  " Even if you have two hours one Sunday every six months , it doesn ' t matter . That ' s going to be enough. " 
So every day , there ' s a field trip where they together create a book -- you can see it being typed up above.
Notice the title of the book ,  " The Book That Was Never Checked Out : Titanic. " 
This is a shot of just some of the tutors during one of the events.
The teachers are going to tell us how we ' re most useful. " 
We ' re working on our college essays . Send them in. " 
They work under the teacher ' s guide , and it ' s all in one big room.
So this is the Everett Middle School Writers '  Room , where we decorated it in buccaneer style.
I want them to write about how to achieve peace in a violent world. " 
She ' s going to sponsor the printing of this book in paperback form.
We had a big party at the end.
Now we ' re sort of addicted to the book thing.
And so then they ' re all sold in the store . This is near the planks.
So it was paying the rent.
There ' s the ocean maps you can see on the left.
Is that a rule ?  I don ' t know.
This is a field trip going on . And so they would be shopping , and they might be more likely to buy some lard , or millet for their parrot , or , you know , a hook , or hook protector for nighttime , all of these things we sell.
So , it became this sort of weird , happy accident.
They didn ' t think that that was going to work there.
So they opened this place . Inside , it ' s like a Costco for superheroes -- all the supplies in kind of basic form.
So then you have the villain containment unit , where kids put their parents . You have the office.
These are some of the products . These are all handmade.
There ' s nothing worse than , you know , getting up there and the cape is bunching up or something like that.
So you can see the full effect!
So this is the space during tutoring hours.
It ' s clearly not school , even though they ' re working shoulder-to-shoulder on tables , pencils and papers , whatever.
Came in . Got this concentrated attention.
So he got hooked on that , and then he started doing other things.
And then he read aloud just a few weeks ago to 500 people at Symphony Space , at a benefit for 826 New York . So he ' s there every day.
This is L.A. , The Echo Park Time Travel Mart :  " Whenever You Are , We ' re Already Then. " 
Anyway . So I ' m going to jump ahead.
Profound leaps forward!
We created a website.
They will tell you how to be useful . I hope that you ' ll step in and help out.
This website is already up , it ' s already got a bunch of stories , a lot of ideas . It ' s called  " Once Upon a School, "  which is a great title , I think.
You email him , he ' ll answer any question you possibly want.
The schools need you . The teachers need you.
Thank you so much.

And so , I want to kind of go through my little story of what I found out.
If you search for the word  " technology, "  it was not used until 1952.
It was in 1829 , and it was invented by a guy who was starting a curriculum -- a course , bringing together all the kinds of arts and crafts , and industry -- and he called it  " Technology. " 
Which is sort of the idea that we normally have about what technology is : It ' s all that new stuff.
But we know that it ' s just not new.
We would die by the billions , and very quickly : The wolves would get us , we would be defenseless , we would be unable to grow enough food , or find enough food.
There are no Neanderthal fossils that are older than 40 years old that we ' ve ever found , and the average age of most of these hunter-gatherer tribes is 20 to 30.
Well , that ' s because they ' re all young.
Imagine a world and basically everybody was 20 to 30 years old.
It was a very short life . But at the same time anthropologists know that most hunter-gatherer tribes of the world , with that very little technology , actually did not spend a very long time gathering the food that they needed : three to six hours a day.
But when the scarcity came when the highs and lows and the droughts came , then people went into starvation.
The other thing that the early man invented was fire.
And if we don ' t have fire , we actually could not live.
And they migrated into the rest of the world at two kilometers per year until , within several tens of thousands of years , we occupied every single watershed on the planet and became the most dominant species , with a very small amount of technology.
And so , already small amounts of technology were transforming the world.
In fact , our humanity , and everything that we think about ourselves is something that we ' ve invented.
We ' re still inventing , and this is what technology is allowing us to do -- it ' s continually to reinvent ourselves.
It ' s not just hammers and gadgets , like laptops.
And the three major phases of the early universe was energy , when the dominant force was energy ; then it became , the dominant force , as it cooled , became matter ; and then , with the invention of life , four billion years ago , the dominant force in our neighborhood became information.
It ' s the increased order.
Stars are basically nuclear fusion machines that self-organize and self-sustain themselves for billions of years , this order against the entropy of the world.
And that the amount of energy per gram per second that flows through life is actually greater than a star -- because of the star ' s long lifespan , the energy density in life is actually higher than a star.
And there are things moving towards greater complexity , moving towards greater diversity , moving towards greater specialization , sentience , ubiquity and most important , evolvability : Those very same things are also present in technology.
So , I would like to say that while there is six kingdoms of life , we can think of technology basically as a seventh kingdom of life.
In transportation , it ' s not to move us , it ' s to move the stuff that we make or buy.
A bacterium , which has no consciousness at all , wants to move towards light.
There ' s really no dispute about progress , if we discount the cost of that.
And with that entire wealth of England , King Henry could not buy any antibiotics , he could not buy refrigeration , he could not buy a trip of a thousand miles.
So , technology is selfish ; technology is generous.
I think that really leads nowhere.
And when it diverts from what you want , we prioritize risk , we evaluate not just the new stuff , but the old stuff.
But it may be a pretty good idea relocated into sustainable nuclear energy for electricity , instead of burning coal.
And actually , in a certain sense , technology is a kind of a method for generating better ideas , if you can think about it that way.
So , our job as humans is to parent our mind children , to find them good friends , to find them a good job.
We don ' t say children are neutral , children are positive.
And we are aware of the price.
Because technology is an extension of life , it ' s in parallel and aligned with the same things that life wants.
It ' s more than just gadgets ; it ' s more than just things that people invent.

Zainab Salbi : Women , wartime and the dream of peace
I just remember the sound was so heavy and so very shocking.
And I kept on staring at it until it disappeared.
This is not a story of a nameless survivor of war , and nameless refugees , whose stereotypical images we see in our newspapers and our TV with tattered clothes , dirty face , scared eyes.
I am another image and vision of another survivor of war.
But there ' s another side that I have witnessed as someone who lived in it and someone who ended up working in it.
 " War, "  a friend of mine said ,  " is not about sound at all.
You know , there is a fear of dying , and do not believe any movie character where the hero is not afraid.
But I think the worst kind of fear is the fear -- as Samia , a Bosnian woman , once told me , who survived the four-years besiege of Sarajevo ; she said ,  " The fear of losing the  ' I '  in me , the fear of losing the  ' I '  in me. " 
She said ,  " But it ' s not fair , because there is only one life , and there should only be one death. " 
This is the language of sterility.
Ninety percent of modern war casualties are civilians.
Or , as we speak now , hundreds of thousands of Congolese women are getting raped and mutilated.
You learn to play an international relations school on your way out and up to national and international leadership.
We are missing the story of Fareeda , a music teacher , a piano teacher , in Sarajevo , who made sure that she kept the music school open every single day in the four years of besiege in Sarajevo and walked to that school , despite the snipers shooting at that school and at her , and kept the piano , the violin , the cello playing the whole duration of the war , with students wearing their gloves and hats and coats.
We are missing the stories of Violet , who , despite surviving genocide in the church massacre , she kept on going on , burying bodies , cleaning homes , cleaning the streets.
There are two sides of war.
There is a side that thinks that peace is the end of fighting , and there is a side that thinks that peace is the arrival of schools and jobs.
In order for us to understand what actually peace means , we need to understand , as one Sudanese woman once told me ,  " Peace is the fact that my toenails are growing back again. " 
And only when there was some sort of peace , her toenails grew back again.
And I do argue that women lead the back-line discussion , but there are also men who are excluded from that discussion.
There is no way we can talk about the building of stability if we don ' t start investing in women and girls.
A Congolese woman , who was telling me about how her children saw their father killed in front of them and saw her raped in front of them and mutilated in front of them , and her children saw their nine-year-old sibling killed in front of them , how they ' re doing okay right now.
We taught her vocational and business skills . We helped her get a job.
I worry that my children have hate in their hearts , and when they want to grow up , they want to fight again the killers of their father and their brother. " 
To start with , these women that I told you about are dancing and singing every single day , and if they can , who are we not to dance ? 
Rumi , a 13th-century Sufi poet , says ,  " Out beyond the worlds of right-doings and wrong-doings , there is a field.
I humbly add -- humbly add -- that out beyond the worlds of war and peace , there is a field , and there are many women and men [who] are meeting there.
The MIT Media Lab ' s John Maeda lives at the intersection of technology and art , a place that can get very complicated . Here he talks about paring down to basics.
First of all , I ' ve been watching this trend where we have these books like such and such  " For Dummies. " 
You know , there ' s also something called the  " Complete Idiot ' s Guide ?  " 
I was in Milan last week , for the Italian launch.
After I wrote  " The Laws of Simplicity, "  I was very tired of simplicity , as you can imagine.
So I went and bought khaki shorts or whatever , and unfortunately , their branding was all about  " Keep It Simple. " 
So , I turned on the TV , and I don ' t watch TV very much , but you know this person ?  This is Paris Hilton , apparently.
So , I opened up this TV Guide thing , and on the E! channel , this  " Simple Life "  show is very popular.
And Cape Cod , there are idyllic roads , and all of us can drive in this room.
So , I thought complexity was attacking me suddenly , so I thought ,  " Ah , simplicity . Very important. " 
But in reality , the sky looked like this . It was a beautiful , complex sky.
I ' m at this place called the Media Lab.
And some of you guys are entrepreneurs , etc. , whatever.
Last year at TED , these were all my titles . I had a lot of titles.
And this also happened , so I have five daughters now.
Many of you may not like tofu because you haven ' t had good tofu , but tofu ' s a good food . It ' s a very simple kind of food.
So often , seven days a week . Family business equals child labor.
And there was this person , Muriel Cooper.
And she ' s very important in my life , because she ' s the one that told me to leave MIT and go to art school.
When I was in Japan -- I went to an art school in Japan -- I had a nice sort of situation , because somehow I was connected to Paul Rand.
And also Ikko Tanaka was a very important mentor in my life -- the Paul Rand of Japan . He designed most of the major icons of Japan , like Issey Miyake ' s brand and also Muji.
When you get older , and you ' re all freaked out , whatever , the mentors calm us down.
And because of that , I always wondered about this human thing.
It used to be kind of two to one . Now , humans are catching up.
So , somehow humans and simplicity are intertwined , I think.
I wrote computer programs to make complex graphics like this.
I built things in a time-graphics dimension.
A very extreme culture.
I ' ve been lucky to have been there before people made these kind of things , and so I made all this kind of stuff that messes with your eyes.
If you ' re in New York , please go and see that.
 " Eye candy "  -- sort of pejorative , don ' t you think ? 
Computer programs are essentially trees , and when you make art with a computer program , there ' s kind of a problem.
I took these to Tokyo in 2001 to make computer objects.
And also , one year , the G3 Bondi Blue thing -- that caddy would come out , like , dangerous , like ,  " whack, "  like that.
Shortly after this , 9/11 happened , and I was very depressed.
Oh , you guys are missing out , if you haven ' t done it yet.
And as a child , I ' d hear that song , you know ,  " Oh , beautiful , for spacious skies , for amber waves of grain, "  so I made this amber waves image.
I wasn ' t sure where to go with this . I invented Cheeto paint.
And so , I began to crinkle up potato chip flecks , and also pretzels.
Sometimes , they find a hair in the food . That ' s my hair.
End of story.
So , I was in the Cape one time , and I typed the word  " simplicity, "  and I discovered , in this weird , M . Night Shyamalan way , that I discovered [the] letters , M , I , T . You know the word ? 
And I wrote this book ,  " The Laws of Simplicity. " 
In Japan , they say that sushi is challenging.
So enjoy your sushi meal later , with the laws of simplicity.
Anyone who has kids knows that if you offer a kid a big cookie or a small cookie , which cookie are they going to take ?  The big cookie.
You know , when you want more , it ' s because you want to enjoy it.
Basically , it always depends.
And I just love to see the world . The world is an amazing place.
It ' s such a joy to sort of experience everything in the world.
He ' s an expert in aging . This horizontal axis is how old you are -- twelve years old , twenty-four years old , seventy-four , ninety-six years old -- and this is some medical data . So , brain strength increases up to 60 , and then after 60 , it sort of goes down . Kind of depressing in a way.
And if you have your vision , vision is interesting.
And then the kids graduate , and you have no responsibility any more -- that ' s very good , too.
They have so many thoughts , and they have so much wisdom , and I think -- you know , this TED thing , I ' ve come here.
And this is an amazing experience for me as well.
243
Because I ' ve cobbled this together to try to meet the challenge of this session.
Optimism is sometimes characterized as a belief , an intellectual posture.
But , as important as it is to change the lightbulbs , it is more important to change the laws.
I have been trying to tell this story for a long time.
And the military historians taught me , during that quest , that military conflicts are typically put into three categories : local battles , regional or theater wars , and the rare but all-important global , world war -- strategic conflicts.
Everything is affected . And we have to organize our response appropriately . We need a worldwide , global mobilization for renewable energy , conservation , efficiency and a global transition to a low-carbon economy.
Greenland remains . Twenty-eight years ago , this is what the polar ice cap -- the North Polar ice cap -- looked like at the end of the summer , at the fall equinox.
Here ' s what happened last fall that has really unnerved the researchers.
That puts a lot of pressure on Greenland.
They have exactly the same amount of carbon.
The global scientific community says : man-made global warming pollution , put into the atmosphere , thickening this , is trapping more of the outgoing infrared.
If it ' s more being trapped on the way out , then you would expect it to be warmer here and cooler here . Here is the lower atmosphere.
What is missing is a sense of urgency.
NBC -- I ' ll show all of the networks here -- the top journalists for NBC asked 956 questions in 2007 of the presidential candidates : two of them were about the climate crisis . ABC : 844 questions , two about the climate crisis.
This is gasoline consumption in all of these countries . And us.
But we have given to the developing countries the technologies and the ways of thinking that are creating the crisis . This is in Bolivia -- over thirty years.
We have to have a unified view of how to go about this : the struggle against poverty in the world and the challenge of cutting wealthy country emissions , all has a single , very simple solution.
Plans to fight poverty in Uganda are mooted , if we do not solve the climate crisis.
We need to do it for our own economy.
I have a stake in these , so I ' ll have a disclaimer there.
And there was a campaign in Australia that involved television and Internet and radio commercials to lift the sense of urgency for the people there.
We can ' t wait for the kind of drought Australia had to change our political culture.
What we need is another hero generation . Those of us who are alive in the United States of America today especially , but also the rest of the world , have to somehow understand that history has presented us with a choice -- just as Jill [Bolte] Taylor was figuring out how to save her life while she was distracted by the amazing experience that she was going through.
I wish I could find the words to convey this.
If we had just one week ' s worth of what we spend on the Iraq War , we could be well on the way to solving this challenge.
What a burden we have. "  I would like to ask you to reframe that . How many generations in all of human history have had the opportunity to rise to a challenge that is worthy of our best efforts ? 
That hurts.
Every single debate has been sponsored by  " Clean Coal. " 
This challenge is part of the fabric of our whole civilization.
Demand -- change the light bulbs , but change the laws . Change the global treaties.
Have a moratorium -- we shouldn ' t have any new coal-fired generating plants that aren ' t able to capture and store CO2 , which means we have to quickly build these renewable sources.
CA : In terms of your own personal role going forward , Al , is there something more than that you would like to be doing ? 
We , most of us here , are Americans . We have a democracy.
There ' s an old African proverb that some of you know that says ,  " If you want to go quickly , go alone ; if you want to go far , go together. "  We have to go far , quickly.
CA : Al Gore , thank you so much for coming to TED.
art,brain,design,museums
But what we ' re going to talk about today is really design . Really good designers are like sponges : they really are curious and absorb every kind of information that comes their way , and transform it so that it can be used by people like us.
Technology always comes into play when design is involved , but science does a little less.
You work over different time zones , you talk to very different people , you multitask . We all know it , and we do it kind of automatically.
He doesn ' t want to put high-speed Internet at home.
And this exhibition is about the work of designers that help us be more elastic , and also of designers that really work on this elasticity as an opportunity . And one last thing is that it ' s not only designers , but it ' s also scientists.
So basically , the idea of being able to build things bottom up , atom by atom , has made them all into tinkerers.
And it was great , because at the beginning was this apology fest -- you know , scientists would tell designers , you know , I don ' t know what style is , I ' m not really elegant.
The exhibition will talk about the work of both designers and scientists , and show how they ' re presenting the possibilities of the future to us.
A lot of the objects in the show are concepts , not objects that exist already . But what you ' re looking at here is the work of some scientists from UCLA.
They seem very , very obsessed with finding out more about the ideal mate.
I tell you , designers are quite fantastic , you know.
The RCA is really quite an amazing school from that viewpoint.
But the problem is that it ' s a really ugly patty.
Then , he took the scans of the best organs and made the meat -- of course , this is done with a Japanese resins food maker , but you know , in the future it could be made better -- which reproduces the best MRI scan of the best cow he could find.
This is SymbioticA , and they ' ve been working -- they were the first ones to do this in-vitro meat -- and now they ' ve also done an in-vitro coat , a leather coat.
One of the most interesting and most important concepts is the idea of scale . We change scale very often : we change resolution of screens , and we ' re not really fazed by it , we do it very comfortably.
It was a beautiful visualization that he did for Seed magazine.
We were discussing with Keith Shrubb* this morning the fact that many scientists tend not to use anything beautiful in their presentations , otherwise they ' re afraid of being considered dumb blondes.
You know , the whole XO laptop , from One Laptop per Child , is based on the idea of collaboration and mash and networking.
Related to the idea of collective design and to the new balance between the individual and the collectiveness , collectivity is the idea of existence maximum.
This is a spa telephone . The idea is that it ' s become so difficult to have a private conversation anywhere that you go to the spa , you have a massage , you have a facial , maybe a rub , and then you have this beautiful pool with this perfect temperature , and you can have this isolation tank phone conversation with whomever you ' ve been wanting to talk with for a long time.
Rapid manufacturing is another big area in which technology and design are , I think , bound to change the world . You ' ve heard about it before many times.
Slowly but surely , the materials became better -- better resins.
And then you can send it to the Kinko ' s store at the corner and go get your chair . Now , the implications of this are enormous , not only regarding the participation of the final buyer in the design process , but also no tracking , no warehousing , no wasted materials.
This is just a really nice touch -- it ' s called slow prototyping.
As the capacity of computers becomes really , really big , and the capacity of our mind not that much bigger , we find that we need to tag as much as we can what we do in order to then retrace our path.
Also , the senses -- designers and scientists all work on trying to expand our senses capabilities so that we can achieve more.
Another shape is made for cancer.
They help companies and other designers think better about the future.
We always think that robots will take care of us , and instead they designed these robots that are very , very needy.
Noam Toran and  " Accessories for Lonely Men "  : the idea is that when you lose your loved one or you go through a bad breakup , what you miss the most are those annoying things that you used to hate when you were with the other person.
There ' s another one that throws plates and breaks them.
He ' s working for the exhibition on a whole series of dolls that explain to children where babies come from today.
And many designers have been working recently on the idea of death and mourning , and what we can do about it today with new technologies.
And this is even better . This is Auger-Loizeau ,  " AfterLife. " 
But I ' m hoping that this particular exhibition will be able to trace a new portrait of where design is going -- which is always , hopefully , a portrait a few years in advance of where the world is going.

But as a physicist , I thought , well if you give me some data , I could maybe understand this . You know , give us a go.
And I was watching the news one night in Oxford.
All this noise around us actually has information.
We brought these guys together and we started to try and solve this.
We extracted the key bits on information to build the database.
What if we were to look at the distribution of the sizes of attacks ? 
So we plot data for sample on this.
It turns out what we found was pretty surprising.
Why should there be order in war ? 
We looked at Colombia , we looked at Afghanistan , and we looked at Senegal.
And yet the fundamental patterns underlying them are the same.
And we found that not only were the distributions these straight lines , but the slope of these lines , they clustered around this value of alpha equals 2.5.
So what ? 
And what we really found was that alpha , if we think about it , is the organizational structure of the insurgency.
Can we create the kind of patterns that we ' re seeing in places like Iraq ? 
So what ' s going on ? 
And if you don ' t find that solution as an insurgent force , you don ' t exist.
How do we end a war like Iraq ? 
We ' ve got to change that.
No one has seen this before . This is literally stuff that we ' ve come through last week.
And the system gets perturbed . It moves upwards to a fragmented state.
The groups became stronger.
It ' s moved up again . The groups are more fragmented.
But I know that we should be looking at the structure of the insurgency to answer that question.

One of my favorite cartoon characters is Snoopy.
This , in a way , is one of the challenges of how to interpret a really good idea.
And within Jewish teachings , the rabbinic teachings , we have Hillel , who taught that you shouldn ' t do to others what you don ' t like being done to yourself.
And we , as taught within the Torah that we are made in the image of God , so we too have to be compassionate.
And I ' m touched , so that tears come to my eyes.
Who cannot be touched by compassion when we see the terrible horrors of the results of war , or famine , or earthquakes , or tsunamis ? 
In Judaism , though , we tend to always say , there has to be a middle way.
And there ' s a lovely rabbinic interpretation of the beginnings of creation , which says that when God created the world , God thought that it would be best to create the world only with the divine attribute of justice.
So , God thought ,  " Nope , I ' m going to create the world just with compassion. " 
If you put too much cold water in , it will shatter.
There is something more though that has to be there.
And so there is also , within Judaism , this notion of love and kindness that becomes very important :  " chesed. " 
You know , there ' s no way that you can do anything for anyone if you overdo things.
It entails understanding the pain of the other.
And , of course , in the modern world , with the environmental movement , we ' re becoming even more aware of the connectivity of things , that something I do here actually does matter in Africa , that if I use too much of my carbon allowance , it seems to be that we are causing a great lack of rain in central and eastern Africa.
Because in Judaism , the number 18 , in Hebrew letters , stands for life -- the word  " life. " 
And they say  " It ' s 18 minutes. " 
What ' s matzah ?  What ' s unleavened bread ?  You don ' t get it.
Now there is , in Judaism , a gorgeous story of a rich man who sat in synagogue one day.
The man was asleep , but he heard the words bread , temple , God , and he woke up.
Then he went home.
He goes into the synagogue .  " God , will you please help me ? 
Takes the bread and goes home.
He goes in there , and it ' s not there.
Every week , the man would bring bread with raisins , with all sorts of good things , put it into the ark.
The rabbi came in and saw what was going on.
 " You mean God didn ' t want my bread ?  " 
 " Of course , what you are doing, "  he said to the rich man ,  " is answering God ' s plea that we should be compassionate.
I have to reevaluate them , try and separate out the material things and my emotions that may be enslaving me , so that I can see the world clearly.
We think of pain as a symptom , but there are cases where the nervous system develops feedback loops and pain becomes a terrifying disease in itself . Starting with the story of a girl whose sprained wrist turned into a nightmare , Elliot Krane talks about the complex mystery of chronic pain , and reviews the facts we ' re just learning about how it works and how to treat it.
I ' m a pediatrician and an anesthesiologist , so I put children to sleep for a living.
Now most of the time , you think of pain as a symptom of a disease , and that ' s true most of the time.
And before I tell you about how it is that we think that happens and what we can do about it , I want to show you how it feels for my patients.
A very different feeling.
In fact , imagine something even worse.
She was 16 years old last year when I met her , and she aspired to be a professional dancer.
But in Chandler ' s case , that was the beginning of the story.
The muscles were frozen , paralyzed -- dystonic is how we refer to that.
The lightest touch of her arm -- the touch of a hand , the touch even of a sleeve , of a garment , as she put it on -- caused excruciating , burning pain.
In your house , wires run in the wall , from the light switch to a junction box in the ceiling and from the junction box to the light bulb.
If you hit your thumb with a hammer , these wires in your arm -- that , of course , we call nerves -- transmit the information into the junction box in the spinal cord where new wires , new nerves , take the information up to the brain where you become consciously aware that your thumb is now hurt.
But it turns out the glial cells have a vital role in the modulation , amplification and , in the case of pain , the distortion of sensory experiences.
That ' s crazy , but that ' s , in fact , what happens with chronic pain.
Well , what do we do about that ? 
We take nerves that are noisy and active that should be quiet , and we put them to sleep with local anesthetics.
And I had lunch with her yesterday because she ' s a college student studying dance at Long Beach here , and she ' s doing absolutely fantastic.
http://www.ted.com/talks/sasa_vucinic_invests_in_free_press.html
Sasa Vucinic invests in free press
Sasha Vucinic : It ' s a great clip , isn ' t it ? 
According to relevant researchers , 83 percent of the population of this planet lives in the societies without independent press.
That is just to understand how big and important this problem is.
Because as we heard yesterday , countries can lose stars from their flags , but they can also lose press freedom , as I guess Americans among us can tell us more about.
At that time I was running B92 , the only independent , for that matter the only electronic media , in the country.
But what they really do , which is very powerful , and that is what governments in the late  ' 90s started doing if they don ' t like independent media companies -- you know , they threaten your advertisers.
We were sitting over there with a country in a downfall , in a slow-motion downfall.
The problem was that we had to re-tape that history a week later ; because if we did not , we could not afford enough tapes to keep archives of that history.
He was running a media systems organization which is still in business , the gentleman is still in business.
The small one was , I just wanted him to help us get those damn tapes , so we can keep that archive for the next 50 years.
It ' s now probably either the biggest or the second biggest media company in the country.
Actually , I underestimated the atrocities , I have to admit.
It ' s so obvious , straight in your face , and somebody must have thought of it.
So I thought that that ' s actually my problem.
You know , forget about charity ; it doesn ' t work.
Media business , or any other business , it needs to be capitalized.
See that it will not work.
And second , that I have no idea how to make it work.
Had the wrong idea ; I thought that we can be a bank.
You collect interest and do nothing in between.
The government cutting them off from all the printing facilities in Bratislava.
It ' s a kind of very nice , sophisticated way how to economically strangle a daily newspaper.
We start the meeting.
And that ' s the best they could do.
Just quickly on the results.
And here is the most stunning number.
We finance anything that a media company would need , from printing presses to transmitters.
That is a  " Who is Who "  list.
Our first loan in Russia was in Chelyabinsk.
Anyway , he ' s running independent newspaper there.
And I want to offer you a deal.
I have no interest in being in media business.
Boris Nikolayevich says ,  " No , you cannot do it. " 
But that is what happens if you ' re in business of independent media , and if you are a banker for independent media.
But there is a second angle to that.
That is not too much , is it ? 
And it ' s why it was invented.
Here is where the problem is , and I ' ll explain to you as well as I can what the problem is.
Now imagine that every second person over here is deaf , does not hear , and switch the lights off.
Instead of all of that we thought there is -- something new needs to be invented.
I don ' t want to advertise them too much ; that ' s not the point.
And before you know it , any social cause can be actually financed in this way.
But you can actually bring it to Europe , too.
Once you have more than 10 of them you have to develop some kind of a matrix.
It says , you know , social impact over here is spectacular , five stars.
And in that way you organize the financing so there are no dark rooms , no blind people running around to find each other.

65 million years ago the dinosaurs had a bad day.
The dinosaurs had a really bad day.
If you look out your window and you can see Long ' s Peak , you ' re probably familiar with it.
We know it was that big because of the impact it had and the crater it left.
It was huge . To give you a sense of the scale , okay , there you go . The scale here is 50 miles on top , a hundred kilometers on the bottom . This thing was 300 kilometers across -- 200 miles -- an enormous crater that excavated out vast amounts of earth that splashed around the globe and set fires all over the planet , threw up enough dust to block out the sun.
Here is one that came in over the United States in October of 1992.
Now , this is not a 200-mile-wide crater , but then again you can see the rock which is sitting right here , about the size of a football , that hit that car and did that damage.
That would be bad.
If you look up at the top , that ' s a parking lot , and those are recreational vehicles right there.
This was 50,000 years ago , so it may have wiped out a few buffalo or antelope , or something like that out in the desert , but it probably would not have caused global devastation.
Another rock came into the Earth ' s atmosphere and this one blew up above the ground , several miles up above the surface of the Earth.
In Meteor Crater it was made of metal , and metal is much tougher , so it made it to the ground.
They ' re just not big enough.
But if it came over a city , an important city -- not that any city is more important than others , but some of them we depend on them more on the global economic basis -- that could do a huge amount of damage to us as a civilization.
Let me note that we have not had a giant impact like the dinosaur-killer for 65 million years . They ' re very rare.
This is an image of an asteroid that passed us in 2009.
This is a rock that was about 30 yards across , so roughly the size of the ones that blew up over Tunguska and hit Arizona 50,000 years ago.
Well the good news is , we ' re looking for them.
You ' ve probably heard about the asteroid Apophis . If you haven ' t yet , you will.
And it ' s going to pass us so close that it ' s actually going to come underneath our weather satellites.
I don ' t think Apophis is a problem.
Well , let me ask you , what happens if you ' re standing in the middle of the road and a car ' s headed for you ?  What do you do ?  You do this.
In the year 2005 , NASA launched a probe called Deep Impact , which slammed into -- slammed a piece of itself into the nucleus of a comet.
We did move the comet a little tiny bit , not very much , but that wasn ' t the point.
Imagine how hard that must be , and we did it.
It ' s like , well , you can try that , but the problem is timing.
I think even NASA can do that , and they proved that they can.
Now we have three years to do something else.
There ' s a group of scientists and engineers and astronauts and they call themselves The B612 Foundation . For those of you who ' ve read  " The Little Prince, "  you understand that reference , I hope . The little prince who lived on an asteroid , it was called B612.
You don ' t land on it , because these things are tumbling end over end . It ' s very hard to land on them.
You can even put in orbit around the Earth where we could mine it , although that ' s a whole other thing . I won ' t go into that.
We have astronomers in place with telescopes looking for them . We have smart people , very , very smart people , who are concerned about this and figuring out how to fix the problem , and we have the technology to do this.
It generates the force a piece of paper would have on your hand , incredibly light , but it can run for months and years , providing that very gentle push.
We don ' t have the Enterprise , but we ' ve got an ion drive now.
This happened to them.
65 million years from now , we don ' t have to have our bones collecting dust in a museum.
194
Now , I ' m going try an experiment . I don ' t do experiments , normally . I ' m a theorist.
What is it made of ? 
And why on earth could that be so ? 
And it was in disagreement with seven -- seven , count them , seven experiments.
Now our friend over there , Albert Einstein , used to pay very little attention when people said ,  " You know , there ' s a man with an experiment that seems to disagree with special relativity.
I ' ll try to make that clear -- partially clear.
Very likely , none is close enough to interact with us.
Would they really have different laws ? 
We may not even be terribly far from it.
And when the mathematics is very simple -- when in terms of some mathematical notation , you can write the theory in a very brief space , without a lot of complication -- that ' s essentially what we mean by beauty or elegance.
The basic law , let ' s say -- here ' s an assumption.
And I won ' t go into a lot of stuff about quantum mechanics and what it ' s like , and so on.
Now , sometimes those probabilities are near certainties.
It ' s the fundamental law and this incredibly long series of accidents , or chance outcomes , that are there in addition.
And we keep doing that , and build more powerful machines , accelerators for particles.
That is absolutely remarkable , and that is a central feature of what I ' m trying to say today.
And the kind of mathematics that we had for the previous skin is almost the same as what we need for the next skin.
Coulomb , in France , found the same law for electric charges.
It ' s a very simple example.
You rotate around the center of the circle , the circle remains unchanged.
Maxwell ' s equations are of course symmetrical under rotations of all of space.
And those symmetries , then , make the equations even shorter , and even prettier , therefore.
Then , using vector analysis , you use rotational symmetry , and you get this next set.
The next -- second -- equation says that there is no magnetism other than that.
Now , here is a very exciting development that many people have not heard of.
Mathematics very similar , but there was a whole new symmetry.
So here we say , again , what we said before : that each skin of the onion shows a similarity to the adjoining skins.
Steps toward unification exhibit the simplicity.
That will account for why beauty is a successful criterion for selecting the right theory.
Four sources told it . That when they had the plague in Cambridge , and he went down to his mother ' s farm -- because the university was closed -- he saw an apple fall from a tree , or on his head or something.
So he said that this principle of nature , consonance :  " This principle of nature being very remote from the conceptions of philosophers , I forbore to describe it in that book , lest I should be accounted an extravagant freak .. .  "  That ' s what we all have to watch out for , especially at this meeting.
It ' s not something in the human mind . The human mind can , of course , appreciate it and enjoy it , use it , but it ' s not -- it doesn ' t stem from the human mind.
The fundamental law is such that the different skins of the onion resemble one another , and therefore the math for one skin allows you to express beautifully and simply the phenomenon of the next skin.
They follow from the fundamental theory.
Life can emerge from physics and chemistry , plus a lot of accidents.
You don ' t need something more in order to get something more.
You don ' t need something more to explain something more.

Waking up with Abraham Lincoln in the morning , thinking of Franklin Roosevelt when I went to bed at night.
Whereas to pursue all three with equal dedication , is to make possible a life filled not only with achievement , but with serenity.
But it wasn ' t simply for office or power or celebrity or fame -- what it was for was to accomplish something worthy enough in life so that he could make the world a little better place for his having lived in it.
But he read books in every spare moment he could find.
How true for Lincoln.
His mother died when he was only nine years old ; his only sister , Sarah , in childbirth a few years later ; and his first love , Ann Rutledge , at the age of 22.
But only as he grew older did he develop a certain consolation from an ancient Greek notion -- but followed by other cultures as well -- that if you could accomplish something worthy in your life , you could live on in the memory of others.
Three things had combined to lay him low.
He was so depressed that friends worried he was suicidal.
So fueled by that ambition , he returned to the state legislature.
So then he surprised the nation with an upset victory for the presidency over three far more experienced , far more educated , far more celebrated rivals.
He said ,  " Look , these are the strongest and most able men in the country.
For each of them soon came to understand that he possessed an unparalleled array of emotional strengths and political skills that proved far more important than the thinness of his external résumé.
These are the qualities we should be looking for in our candidates in 2008.
And with a beauty of language -- almost as if the Shakespeare and the poetry he had so loved as a child had worked their way into his very soul.
So he put the pen down.
I was so thrilled to find an interview with the great Russian writer , Leo Tolstoy , in a New York newspaper in the early 1900s.
But before I finished , the chief of the barbarians stood up and said ,  ' But wait , you haven ' t told us about the greatest ruler of them all.
And then in the interview he said ,  " What made Lincoln so great ? 
That ambition that had allowed him to laboriously educate himself by himself , to go through that string of political failures and the darkest days of the war.
My relationship with him began on a rather curious level.
Not that peculiar -- there were only three women out of the 16 White House Fellows.
And the theme of the article was how to remove Lyndon Johnson from power.
Eventually accompanied him to his ranch to help him on those memoirs , never fully understanding why he ' d chosen me to spend so many hours with.
There was a problem with these stories , however , which I later discovered , which is that half of them weren ' t true.
And he had somewhat of a minor league womanizing reputation.
And there was wine and cheese and a red-checked tablecloth -- all the romantic trappings.
But I must say , the older I ' ve gotten , the more I realize what an incredible privilege it was to have spent so many hours with this aging lion of a man.
And I ' d like to believe that the privilege fired within me the drive to understand the inner person behind the public figure , that I ' ve tried to bring to each of my books since then.
And yet , years of concentration solely on work and individual success meant that in his retirement he could find no solace in family , in recreation , in sports or in hobbies.
He spoke with immense sadness in his voice , saying maybe he should have spent more time with his children , and their children in turn.
So deep , for instance , was Abraham Lincoln ' s love of Shakespeare , that he made time to spend more than a hundred nights in the theater , even during those dark days of the war.
His storytelling powers had first been recognized when he was on the circuit in Illinois.
And they ' re not quite what you might expect from our marble monument.
They figured he ' d be upset about the indignity of George Washington being in an outhouse.
 " What do you mean ?  "  they said.
In my own life , I shall always be grateful for having found a form of play in my irrational love of baseball.
But he made me feel I was telling him a fabulous story.
Which took much of the drama of this two-hour telling away.
And I was so excited -- first person I ' d ever see outside of Ebbets Field.
He said ,  " Don ' t worry . He ' s speaking in a parish hall.
And there were no indulgences around that I could buy.
But then , unfortunately , he said ,  " And what else , my child ?  " 
And I had to say that I wished that various New York Yankees players would break arms , legs and ankles -- -- so that the Brooklyn Dodgers could win their first World Series.
I love the Brooklyn Dodgers , as you do , but I promise you some day they will win fairly and squarely.
Well , though my father died of a sudden heart attack when I was still in my 20s , before I had gotten married and had my three sons , I have passed his memory -- as well as his love of baseball -- on to my boys.
When I open my eyes and I see my sons in the place where my father once sat , I feel an invisible loyalty and love linking my sons to the grandfather whose face they never had a chance to see , but whose heart and soul they have come to know through all the stories I have told.
Thank you for letting me be that storyteller today.
1364
Which means that , while we all have one biography , they have many.
It ' s made of clay , and it ' s been fashioned into a cylinder shape , covered with close writing and then baked dry in the sun.
The story begins in the Iran-Iraq war and that series of events that culminated in the invasion of Iraq by foreign forces , the removal of a despotic ruler and instant regime change.
And you all know roughly the story.
And the great gold vessels of the temple in Jerusalem had been taken to Babylon.
And that night , Daniel tells us , at the height of the festivities a hand appeared and wrote on the wall ,  " You are weighed in the balance and found wanting , and your kingdom is handed over to the Medes and the Persians. " 
 " The writing on the wall "  is part of our everyday language.
And that is what this cylinder is , the declaration made by the ruler guided by God who had toppled the Iraqi despot and was going to bring freedom to the people.
And it ' s written , as we ' ll see in due course , by very skilled P.R . consultants.
He ' ll let them return to their countries.
This is the decree , this object is the evidence for the fact that the Jews , after the exile in Babylon , the years they ' d spent sitting by the waters of Babylon , weeping when they remembered Jerusalem , those Jews were allowed to go home.
This is the Jewish version of the same story.
The central element , still , of the notion of return , a central part of the life of Judaism.
What was going on was the fundamental shift in Middle Eastern history.
This empire is , in fact , the Middle East as we now know it , and it ' s what shapes the Middle East as we now know it.
It had to be run in different languages.
Cyrus sets up a model of how you run a great multinational , multifaith , multicultural society.
And of course , Alexander couldn ' t sustain a government and it fragmented.
This is a 16th century image to show you how widespread his veneration actually was.
After Alexander , the other empires , Babylon declines , falls into ruins , and all the traces of the great Babylonian empire are lost -- until 1879 when the cylinder is discovered by a British Museum exhibition digging in Babylon.
No other evidence.
But -- and this , of course , is where it becomes complicated -- the facts were true , hurrah for archeology , but the interpretation was rather more complicated.
 " Marduk , we hold , called Cyrus by his name. " 
The Hebrew writers in the Old Testament , you will not be surprised to learn , take a rather different view of this.
It ' s a remarkable example of two different priestly appropriations of the same event , two different religious takeovers of a political fact.
And it ' s quite clear the cylinder is older than the text of Isaiah , and yet , Jehovah is speaking in words very similar to those used by Marduk.
Because interestingly , of course , Cyrus is a good Iranian with a totally different set of gods who are not mentioned in any of these texts.
And the response to this by the Jewish population in Eastern Europe is rhapsodic.
The state of Israel is setup , and 50 years later , in the late 60s , it ' s clear that Britain ' s role as the imperial power is over.
When he has his great celebrations in Persepolis , he summons the cylinder and the cylinder is lent by the British Museum , goes to Tehran , and is part of those great celebrations of the Pahlavi dynasty.
Then another Iran-Iraq war.
So when the British Museum and Tehran National Musuem cooperate and work together , as we ' ve been doing , the Iranians ask for one thing only as a loan.
It ' s shown being presented here , put into its case by the director of the National Museum of Tehran , one of the many women in Iran in very senior positions , Mrs . Ardakani.
This is beyond any blockbuster exhibition in the West.
It became a great emblem , a great subject of debate about what Iran is at home and abroad.
Here you see this out-sized Cyrus cylinder on the stage with great figures from Iranian history gathering to take their place in the heritage of Iran.
It stands with the American constitution.
In New York this autumn , it will be present when the great debates about the future of the Middle East take place.
The right of peoples to live together in the same state , worshiping differently , freely -- a Middle East , a world , in which religion is not the subject of division or of debate.
Orphanages are costly and can cause irreparable damage both mentally and physically for its charges -- so why are they still so ubiquitous ?  Georgette Mulheir gravely describes the tragedy of orphanages and urges us to end our reliance on them , by finding alternate ways of supporting children in need.
Across Europe and Central Asia , approximately one million children live in large residential institutions , usually known as orphanages.
But 60 years of research has demonstrated that separating children from their families and placing them in large institutions seriously harms their health and development , and this is particularly true for young babies.
New parents are astonished by the rapidity of this learning.
It is the model for all future relationships with friends , with partners and with their own children.
Those of us who remember the newspaper reports that came out of Romania after the 1989 revolution will recall the horrors of the conditions in some of those institutions.
It was hard to believe there were any children there at all , yet the director showed me into room after room , each containing row upon row of cots , in each of which lay a child staring into space.
Over the next few days , I began to realize that this quietness was not exceptional.
The children must be woken at 7 and fed at 7:30.
Since my first visit to Ceausescu ' s institution , I ' ve seen hundreds of such places across 18 countries , from the Czech Republic to Sudan.
Most of these children will never leave the institution again.
When they leave the institution , they find it really difficult to cope and to integrate into society.
Many countries have not developed inclusive schools , and so even children with a very mild disability are sent away to a residential special school , at age six or seven.
This state of affairs is neither necessary nor is it inevitable.
One study suggests that a family support service costs 10 percent of an institutional placement , whilst good quality foster care costs usually about 30 percent.
In Moldova , despite extreme poverty and the terrible effects of the global financial crisis , the numbers of children in institutions has reduced by more than 50 percent in the last five years , and the resources are being redistributed to family support services and inclusive schools.
Awareness-raising is required at every level of society.

Jeremy Gilley : One day of peace
And when I was 12 , I became an actor.
I got a D in pottery , which was the one thing that I did get -- which was useful , obviously.
And that fascinated me , because I ' d been messing around with a camera most of my life.
Maybe there ' s a little change I can get involved in.
But I realized that , having been messing around with structure as an actor , that a series of sound bites in itself wasn ' t enough , that there needed to be a mountain to climb , there needed to be a journey that I had to take.
Is that a responsible thing to do ?  Etc. , etc.
There was no day of global unity.
So obviously we didn ' t have any money.
How do you create a day voted by every single head of state in the world to create the first ever Ceasefire Nonviolence Day , the 21st of September ? 
It poisoned his blood . He died when I was 11.
So we began this journey , and we launched it in 1999.
And I remember the first letter.
I ' d love to talk to you about the first ever day of peace. " 
And of course , we went and saw him and it was amazing.
And we invited everybody , and no press showed up.
For me , it was really about the process.
And just staying in the moment with it was a beautiful thing and really empowering actually.
Yeah , I ' m not worried about it now.
Dr . Oscar Arias , Nobel Peace laureate , president now of Costa Rica , said ,  " I ' ll do everything that I can. " 
76 countries in the last 12 years , I ' ve visited.
I ' m really clear about how young people feel when you talk to them about this idea of having a starting point for their actions for a more peaceful world through their poetry , their art , their literature , their music , their sport , whatever it might be.
I felt that I was presenting a case on behalf of the global community to try and create this day.
The fact is that , if I tried and it didn ' t work , then I could make a statement about how unwilling the global community is to unite -- until , it was in Somalia , picking up that young girl.
Because we ' ve got to stop , we ' ve got to do something where we unite -- separate from all the politics and religion that , as a young person , is confusing me.
Yeah , but there were hundreds of individuals , obviously , who made that a reality.
And as I mentioned , when it started , we were at the Globe , and there was no press.
And it was 8:00 AM when I stood there.
And it was obviously a tragic moment for the thousands of people who lost their lives , there and then subsequently all over the world.
It ' s been created ; nobody knows.
I remember putting that film out and going to cynics.
And that was even worse than actually what had just happened in many ways , because it couldn ' t not work.
That ' s what I ' d heard.
And I went back to the U.N . for another couple of years.
And then UNAMA became involved in Afghanistan.
And so I went back to London , and I went and saw this chap , Jude Law.
I won ' t go into that.
And I could sort of see a little look in his eye of interest.
And that attention would help leverage the situation , as well as all of the other sides of it. " 
And actually I could never raise awareness by myself , no matter what I ' d achieved.
You can ' t just expect it to work . You have to get out and work. " 
This amazing woman , Fatima Gailani , was absolutely instrumental in what went on as she was the spokesperson for the resistance against the Russians.
We had to wait now and see what happened.
We see it as a window of opportunity.
And days later , 1.6 million children were vaccinated against polio as a consequence of everybody stopping.
We went back to Afghanistan , because the next year was coming , and we wanted to support.
And we gave the film over.
And then there was this other statement that came out from the U.N . Department of Security and Safety saying that , in Afghanistan , because of this work , the violence was down by 70 percent.
And I was there thinking about what was going on.
We have to go for a global truce.
And we will utilize all kinds of things -- have a dance and social media and visiting on Facebook and visit the website , sign the petition.
We ' ve got resources at the moment in 174 countries trying to get young people to be the driving force behind the vision of that global truce.
Why don ' t we all team up ?  Why don ' t we bring truce to life ? 
On the Day of Peace , there ' s thousands of football matches all played , from the favelas of Brazil to wherever it might be.
And when I stand here in front of all of you , and the people who will watch these things , I ' m excited , on behalf of everybody I ' ve met , that there is a possibility that our world could unite , that we could come together as one , that we could lift the level of consciousness around the fundamental issues , brought about by individuals.
And I sat with him a few weeks ago.
I said ,  " What would you do ? 
It ' s all about you and me.
And there ' s a wonderful man sitting in this audience , and I don ' t know where he is , who said to me a few days ago -- because I did a little rehearsal -- and he said ,  " I ' ve been thinking about this day and imagining it as a square with 365 squares , and one of them is white. " 
Thank you TED . Thank you.
Africa,culture,education,global issues,leadership,politics,social change
The question of transformation in Africa really is a question of leadership.
We all heard about the importance of stories yesterday.
There was not a flashlight , not a lantern , not a candle -- pitch black.
The second time was a procedure that involved local anesthesia.
And that hospital could have afforded flashlights.
And so three months later , just before she returned to the United States , nurses in Accra go on strike.
You see , the folks at the ministry of health , the hospital administrators , the doctors , the nurses -- they are among just five percent of their peers who get an education after secondary school.
So when I speak of leadership , I ' m not talking about just political leaders.
The lawyers , the judges , the policemen , the doctors , the engineers , the civil servants -- those are the leaders.
They were a pervasive presence.
No sign to this effect.
It was a little reckless , but you know , I was 16.
So he takes their radio , talks to their boss , and gets us all released.
I learned something about courage.
It was a breath of fresh air.
They wanted us to be concerned about social issues.
It matters a great deal.
And it was brilliant to be part of this team.
And I was part of that.
Now , I ' ve already spoken about one of the reasons why this has occurred.
And those leaders did not emerge spontaneously.
And for the first time , Africa mattered more to me than ever before.
Somalia had disintegrated into anarchy.
This was not the world that I ' d want my children to grow up in.
And they might say ,  " Look , don ' t even try. " 
And it was the same -- learning by rote -- from primary school through graduate school.
Because it seems to me that every society , every society , must be very intentional about how it trains its leaders.
I ' m trying to bring the experience that I had at Swarthmore to Africa.
We ' re trying to train leaders of exceptional integrity , who have the ability to confront the complex problems , ask the right questions , and come up with workable solutions.
And a month into it , I come to the office , and I have this email from one of our students.
But I was moved almost to tears because I understood what was happening to this young man.
There ' s a very vibrant debate going on on campus now over whether they should have an honor code , and if so , what it should look like.
Now , we cannot achieve perfection , but if we reach for it , then we can achieve excellence.
Am I out of time ?  OK.
These young future leaders are beginning to understand the real business of leadership , the real privilege of leadership , which is after all to serve humanity.
It says a lot about the culture that ' s forming on campus.
It turns out that corporate West Africa also appreciates what ' s happening with our students.
You know , that passion for what they ' re doing.
I think that the current and future leaders of Africa have an incredible opportunity to drive a major renaissance on the continent.
We have reached a moment from which can emerge a great society within one generation.
http://www.ted.com/talks/alberto_cairo_there_are_no_scraps_of_men.html
Alberto Cairo : There are no scraps of men
We do more than that.
It took quite many years for the program to become what it is now.
I was also working in the orthopedic center , we call it.
There was so much to learn.
There were many other things to do.
It ' s something that comes out from the past.
I was assigned to work for the homeless , for the internally displaced people.
You know , when you want to forget , you don ' t want to see things , so you just want to go to your room , to lock yourself inside and say ,  " That ' s enough. " 
I ducked.
So I stopped the car and I went to help.
And I ask ,  " What are you doing out in the street in this situation ?  " 
Why don ' t you have the artificial legs ?  " 
The man , his name was Mahmoud , and the child , whose name was Rafi , left.
Who is going to make the legs for him ?  " 
And so the following day , I went to the orthopedic center.
Give him some money. " 
And there was some staff too.
We have to go away . We cannot stay here. " 
But Najmuddin told me ,  " Listen now , we ' re here. " 
We have other things to do. " 
Also one of the physical therapists reported that Mahmoud could be provided with a leg , but not immediately.
In the evening , I went to speak with the bosses at the headquarters , and I told them -- I lied -- I told them ,  " Listen , we are going to start a couple of hours per day , just a few repairs. " 
And Najmuddin was staying there , doing everything and reporting on the patients.
And Mahmoud was coming every day.
A couple of times I crossed the front line in the very place where Mahmoud and his son were crossing.
It was April , I remember , a very beautiful day.
So we chose a small spot in the garden.
We could hear in the air the bullets passing.
And we ran.
I can run , and now you can go to school.
And then I understood , physical rehabilitation is a priority.
I met Mahmoud one year later.
He told me ,  " He ' s at school . He ' d doing quite well. " 
He was clearly embarrassed.
Now help me not to be a beggar anymore. " 
I don ' t want them to be teased at school by the other students. " 
It was the easiest way.
And then he sat down.
 " What ?  "  I said ,  " Stop. " 
 " Excuse me ?  " 
And it ' s even cruel to think of anything like this.
So the only things I could manage to obtain was a kind of a compromise.
I can ' t believe it. " 
It was true.
I remember him sitting behind the workbench smiling.
So of course , I understood.
And you know what ? 
They are 7,000 every year -- people coming for the first time.
And then the surprise turns into hope.
People like Mahmoud are agents of change.
So you do vocational training , home education for those who cannot go to school.
Terrible Najmuddin , is that one.
There are plenty of countries at war like Afghanistan.
Well don ' t think that the changes in Afghanistan are over ; not at all . We are going on.
At the beginning , when Anajulina told me ,  " We would like to start it, "  I hesitated.
Is it really necessary ?  " 
And you should see me during the match.
That was my story . Thank you very much.

As a body architect , I fascinate with the human body and explore how I can transform it.
I started my own experiments.
We transformed our apartments into our laboratories , and worked in a very spontaneous and immediate way.
And I became obsessed with this idea of blurring the perimeter of the body , so you couldn ' t see where the skin ended and the near environment started.
I ' m fascinated with the idea of what happens when you merge biology with technology , and I remember reading about this idea of being able to reprogram biology , in the future , away from disease and aging.
I worked with a synthetic biologist , and I created a swallowable perfume , which is a cosmetic pill that you eat and the fragrance comes out through the skin ' s surface when you perspire.
I ' ve learned that there ' s no boundaries , and if I look at the evolution of my work i can see threads and connections that make sense.
And I feel like I ' ve just got started.

To give you some perspective , in the previous two decades of searching , we had only known about 400 prior to Kepler.
And that distance and knowing that amount of light is important because it ' s a little like you or I sitting around a campfire : You want to be close enough to the campfire so that you ' re warm , but not so close that you ' re too toasty and you get burned.
It ' s shown here in visible light.
These freckles are called sunspots , and they are just one of the manifestations of the Sun ' s magnetic field.
If we had UV eyes or X-ray eyes , we would really see the dynamic and dramatic effects of our Sun ' s magnetic activity -- the kind of thing that happens on other stars as well.
I ' m showing here Venus , Earth and Mars -- three planets in our own solar system that are roughly the same size , but only one of which is really a good place to live.
While it ' s Kepler the telescope , the instrument that stares , it ' s we , life , who are searching.

I have a very peculiar background , attitude and approach to the real world because I am a conjurer.
We depend on the fact that audiences , such as yourselves , will make assumptions.
And it makes a very bad microphone ; I ' ve tried it many times.
Wrong . I ' m not looking at you . I can ' t see you.
Quite empty frames.
Now , I have to do something -- first of all , switch to real glasses so I can actually see you , which would probably be a convenience . I don ' t know.
This is a full bottle of Calms Forte.
Indeed , the whole container.
I play the part of a magician , a wizard , if you will , a real wizard.
Oh , they also say they will sell you astrology or other fortunetelling methods.
But the one thing that has made a big comeback just recently is this business of speaking with the dead.
I wonder if that ' s true.
Now , I have two questions I would like to ask these people if I had the opportunity to do so.
I ' m here with all my old friends , my deceased friends , and my family and all the puppy dogs and the kittens that I used to have when I was a little girl.
Where is the will ? 
The second question that I ' d like to ask , rather simple : Suppose I ask them to contact the spirit of my deceased father-in-law , as an example.
Is it 20 questions ?  No , it ' s more like 120 questions.
There ' s one fellow out there , Van Praagh is his name , James Van Praagh.
And what does he do ?  He likes to tell you how the deceased got deceased , the people he ' s talking to through his ear , you see ? 
It ' s that simple.
He ' s saying to me ,  ' Electricity. '  Was he an electrician ?  "   " No. " 
Now , folks often ask us at the James Randi Educational Foundation , they call me , they say ,  " Why are you so concerned about this , Mr . Randi ? 
And then the people look in the mirror , and they say , I just paid a lot of money for that reading.
We call her  " The Talons. " 
You can tell it ' s her .  " Hello , this is Sylvia Browne. " 
He ' s well educated , he ' s smart , he knows what Sylvia Browne is doing but he doesn ' t give a damn.
She gives you the names of your guardian angels , that ' s first.
It turns out that the women that she gives readings for were all Babylonian princesses , or something like that.
And the strange thing -- folks , you may have noticed this too.
Now , Sylvia Browne is an exception , an exception in one way , because the James Randi Educational Foundation , my foundation , offers a one million dollar prize in negotiable bonds.
Sylvia Browne is an exception in that she ' s the only professional psychic in the whole world that has accepted our challenge.
Duh.
She couldn ' t reach me . Now she says she doesn ' t want to reach me because I ' m a godless person.
We get people coming to the foundation all the time.
Homeopathy , let ' s find out what that ' s all about.
This is Calms Forte , 32 caplets of sleeping pills! I forgot to tell you that.
Keep your seats -- it ' s going to be okay.
What is homeopathy ? 
It ' s exactly equivalent to taking one 325 milligram aspirin tablet , throwing it into the middle of Lake Tahoe , and then stirring it up , obviously with a very big stick , and waiting two years or so until the solution is homogeneous.
Now wait a minute , we heard about a guy in Florida.
Work on it . Work on it.
They might , some place out there.
I mean that ' s a fabulous amount of money.
We really would love to have suggestions from you folks on how to contact federal , state and local authorities to get them to do something.
And we must do something about those problems.
It ' s the bottom line , the dollar line.
It ' s www.randi.org.
She cashed in the CDs , she gave away the stocks and the certificates.
We ' re waiting for the psychics to come forth and snap at it.
She did accept and then backed away.

I study health systems in these countries.
Here we have a scene that you would find in any operating room across the U.S . or any other developed country.
It needs an extremely well-trained anesthesiologist with years of training with complex machines to help her monitor the flows of the gas and keep her patients safe and anesthetized throughout the surgery.
It needs a hospital whose budget can allow it to support one machine costing upwards of 50 or $100,000.
In this hospital , there is one person qualified to deliver anesthesia , and she ' s qualified because she has 12 , maybe 18 months of training in anesthesia.
And the price tag of the machine that I mentioned could represent maybe a quarter or a third of the annual operating budget for this hospital.
And you can imagine , the generator breaks down or runs out of fuel.
It ' s not just inappropriate , it becomes really unsafe.
And everything began pretty auspiciously.
And everything began well until the power went out.
And now this routine surgery that many of you have probably experienced , and others are probably the product of , has now become a tragedy.
He was the chief of anesthesiology in a hospital in Malawi , a teaching hospital.
So he took a walk down the hall to where they threw all those machines that had just crapped out on them -- I think that ' s the scientific term -- and he just started tinkering.
Now let me show you a little bit about how this machine works.
There ' s a built-in oxygen concentrator down there.
But so in here when there ' s electricity , the oxygen concentrator takes in room air.
Now if you don ' t have power , or , God forbid , the power cuts out in the middle of surgery , this machine transitions automatically , without even having to touch it , to drawing in room air from this inlet.
But we ' ve put a long-life battery backup on here.
It ' s just a reality of anesthesia . The lungs can be paralyzed.
I shudder to say simple ; it ' s straightforward.
This is an incredibly rugged machine.
This machine comes in at an eighth of the cost of the conventional machine that I showed you earlier.
Is this the design that ' s going to work in place ? 
This really seems like a cost-effective , scalable solution to a problem that ' s really pervasive.
They have a really cool anesthesia simulation lab out in Baltimore.
I think it is incredibly fascinating and an important component of health.
But you know , it ' s just one of so many ways that design , appropriate design , can have an impact on health outcomes.
environment,food,green,sustainability
I take it quite seriously , but I ' m here to talk about something that ' s become very important to me in the last year or two.
But I still think that this -- -- may be this year ' s version of this.
There was the bomb , and there ' s now.
Since every scientist in the world now believes this , and even President Bush has seen the light , or pretends to , we can take this is a given.
Now , you can make all the jokes you want about cow farts , but methane is 20 times more poisonous than CO2 , and it ' s not just methane.
But lists like this become kind of numbing , so let me just say this : if you ' re a progressive , if you ' re driving a Prius , or you ' re shopping green , or you ' re looking for organic , you should probably be a semi-vegetarian.
And that ' s the direct result of eating a Western diet.
We didn ' t know that pollution did more than cause bad visibility.
No . Overconsumption of animals , and of course , junk food , is the problem , along with our paltry consumption of plants.
This evidence is overwhelming at this point.
What do they have in common ? 
We ' re not born craving Whoppers or Skittles.
Incredible , isn ' t it ? 
Either they ' re outvoted by puppets of agribusiness , or they are puppets of agribusiness.
And guess what ? 
But with lots of intelligent people focusing on whether food is organic or local , or whether we ' re being nice to animals , the most important issues just aren ' t being addressed.
That ' s our number . 10 billion.
And with our hyper-consumption of those animals producing greenhouse gases and heart disease , kindness might just be a bit of a red herring.
And locavore , for those of you who don ' t know , is someone who eats only locally grown food -- which is fine if you live in California , but for the rest of us it ' s a bit of a sad joke.
How we got to this place is the history of food in the United States.
Every family had a cook , usually a mom.
In fact , when margarine was invented , several states passed laws declaring that it had to be dyed pink , so we ' d all know that it was a fake.
Eating ethnic was unheard of unless you were ethnic.
You just ate.
There were no health claims , at least not federally sanctioned ones.
The cornflake hadn ' t been invented.
And again , everyone ate local.
The South and West became agricultural hubs , and in other parts of the country , suburbs took over farmland.
Thus arrived convenience.
But this may have cut down on housework , but it cut down on the variety of food we ate as well.
What could be easier , more filling or healthier for your family than broiling a steak ? 
New drugs kept them healthy.
And chicken soon joined them on the throne.
Now , someone had to eat all that stuff , so we got fast food.
Not that they were any good , but they were there.
My mom is not here , so I can say this now.
We tended gardens , we became interested in organic food , we knew or we were vegetarians.
Perhaps because it was being produced rationally , as if it were plastic , food gained magical or poisonous powers , or both.
Instead they were sold on yogurt , yogurt being almost as good as broccoli.
Sadly , it was at this time that the family dinner was put in a coma , if not actually killed -- the beginning of the heyday of value-added food , which contained as many soy and corn products as could be crammed into it.
And zapped horribly , pathetically.
Leading the way -- what ' s leading the way ? 
And as evidence that things can actually change , you can now find organic food in supermarkets , and even in fast-food outlets.
And if that salmon ' s from Chile , and it ' s killed down there and then flown 5,000 miles , whatever , dumping how much carbon into the atmosphere ? 
Now here is where we all meet.
And this is not only an issue of social justice , as Ann Cooper said -- and , of course , she ' s completely right -- but it ' s also one of global survival.
70 percent of the agricultural land on Earth , 30 percent of the Earth ' s land surface is directly or indirectly devoted to raising the animals we ' ll eat.
And I say this as a man who has eaten a fair share of corned beef in his life.
But don ' t we need meat to be big and strong ? 
But , no , even if we were all steroid-filled football players , the answer is no.
It would seem absurd , but that ' s exactly what should happen , and what progressive people , forward-thinking people should be doing and advocating , along with the corresponding increase in the consumption of plants.
Ann Cooper ' s right.
Less meat , less junk , more plants.
We can continue the search for the ingredients we love , and we can continue to spin yarns about our favorite meals.

Graham Hill : Why I ' m a weekday vegetarian
I knew that eating a mere hamburger a day can increase my risk of dying by a third.
I also knew that I ' m not alone.
Yet , there I was -- chk , chk , chk -- tucking into a big old steak.
Imagine your last hamburger.
So I wondered , might there be a third solution ? 
The name says it all : Nothing with a face Monday through Friday.
So you want to swap those out with some good , sustainably harvested fish.
My footprint ' s smaller , I ' m lessening pollution , I feel better about the animals , I ' m even saving money.
http://www.ted.com/talks/nick_bostrom_on_our_biggest_problems.html
Nick Bostrom on our biggest problems
The first is -- death is a big problem.
So the annual death rate adds up to 150,000 -- sorry , the daily death rate -- 150,000 people per day , which is a huge number by any standard.
Sometimes , we don ' t see a problem because either it ' s too familiar or it ' s too big.
I ' ve talked for three minutes.
I just look at the information , and knowledge , and experience that is lost due to natural causes of death in general , and aging , in particular.
But let ' s suppose we did this.
It ' s one of the great cultural tragedies that we remember , even today.
Existential risk -- the second big problem.
You would think that it would be of some interest to try to find out more about this given that the stakes are so big , but it ' s a very neglected area.
Another author doesn ' t give any numerical estimate , but says the probability is significant that it will fail.
Everybody who has looked at this and studied it agrees.
If we were to take into account future generations that will never come into existence if we blow ourselves up , then the figure becomes astronomical.
The only thing you should focus on would be to reduce existential risk because even the tiniest decrease in existential risk would just overwhelm any other benefit you could hope to achieve.
It might have been at the moment of some great , creative inspiration you might have had when you just entered this flow stage.
Every once in a while we have these moments , and we realize just how good life can be when it ' s at its best.
And it ' s really difficult to recall , in a normal frame of mind , just how good life can be at its best.
It ' s easy to say what we don ' t want.
We got rid of all of these things.
Or is it possible to find something a little bit more inspiring to work towards ? 
And this is the answer -- we would have to change.
Now , when we think about changing human nature , the first thing that comes to mind are these human modification technologies -- growth hormone therapy , cosmetic surgery , stimulants like Ritalin , Adderall , anti-depressants , anabolic steroids , artificial hearts.
But there ' s a kind of queasiness that these are unnatural in some way.
Mood modifiers have been used from time immemorial -- caffeine , alcohol , nicotine , immune system enhancement , vision enhancement , anesthetics -- we take that very much for granted , but just think about how great progress that is -- like , having an operation before anesthetics was not fun.
So in a broad sense , we don ' t need to think about technology as only little gadgets , like these things here , but even institutions and techniques , psychological methods and so forth.
It ' s possible to assume , setting aside a possibility of catastrophe , that sooner or later we will develop all of these.
Intellectual capacity -- let ' s take that box , which falls into a lot of different sub-categories : memory , concentration , mental energy , intelligence , empathy.
It ' s just better to be able to understand more of the world around you and the people that you are communicating with , and to remember what you have learned.
We ' re just lucky that we have the requisite neural machinery to process music and to appreciate it and enjoy it.
Imagine a species that just didn ' t have this neural machinery for processing music.
So we could think of adding on different , new sensory capacities and mental faculties.
Able to switch back and forth more easily would be a neat thing to be able to do -- easier to achieve the flow state , when you ' re totally immersed in something you are doing.
That ' s probably not all that difficult.
It ' s just a single gene.
Down here in this little corner , here , we have the little sub-space of this larger space that is accessible to human beings -- beings with our biological capacities.
Then you could live sorts of lives and accumulate wisdoms that are just not possible for humans as we currently are.
We have no reason to believe that within this much , much larger space there would not also be extremely worthwhile modes of being , perhaps ones that would be way beyond our wildest ability even to imagine or dream about.

And I want to start with a question that has just been consuming me since I first became familiar with your work.
I had the question popped into my head : What does the cone that connects the sun and the Earth look like if you could connect the two spheres ? 
The sun end was about four inches in diameter , and then it tapered over about 35 feet to about a millimeter at the Earth end.
TS : Well , like the magnetically levitated objects -- like that silver one there , that was the result of hundreds of experiments with magnets , trying to find a way to make something float with the least possible connection to the ground.
JH : Because if the power went out , there would just be a big noise.
TS : The magnetic works are a combination of gravity and magnetism , so it ' s a kind of mixture of these ambient forces that influence everything.
My sculptures are normally very simplified.
I mean , you don ' t know necessarily where you ' re headed when you begin , even though the forces can be calculated.
I threw it into an orbit , and it only had one color , and when it got to the center , the paint kept running out , so I had to run in there , didn ' t have any control over the spigot remotely.
And if you put them together in different combinations -- just like printing in a sense , like how a magazine color is printed -- and put them under certain forces , which is orbiting them or passing them back and forth or drawing with them , these amazing things started appearing.
I want to just say -- so this is Jack , Nick and Louie.
JH : Whoa . That is ...
I can redeem this painting , just continuing on , doing layers upon layers.
TS : Yes , they ' re servos with cams that pinch these rubber tubes.
It could be tomato sauce , or anything could be dispensed -- sand , powders or anything like that.
TS : Well , this painting here , I wanted to do something very simple , a simple , iconic image of two ripples interfering.
There are lines in front of the one on the right , and there are lines behind the one on the left , and so it takes it into different planes.
Like this green one , this is a painting I did about 10 years ago , but it has some -- see , in the upper third -- there are these moires and interference patterns that are radio kind of imagery.
TS : It is the paint actually , makes it real.
And I love the shapes that I see in scientific observations and apparatus , especially astronomical forms and the idea of the vastness of it , the scale , is very interesting to me.
When you look into it , it ' s sort of like looking at cloud patterns , but sometimes they ' re very modeled and highly rendered.
And maybe it ' s the kind of forms we ' ll discover underneath the surface of Mars , where there are probably lakes with fish swimming under the surface.
Is that relevant to your work ? 
I mean , I ' ve got the symptoms.
All my creations really start on small drawings , which I have thousands of , and it ' s my way of just thinking.
You think of yourself as the servant.
The universe is in our mind , and our minds are in the universe.
It ' s a terrific studio assistant.
http://www.ted.com/talks/shea_hembrey_how_i_became_100_artists.html
Shea Hembrey : How I became 100 artists
And I think it was a great place to grow up as an artist because I grew up around quirky , colorful characters who were great at making with their hands.
And if the TV was on , we were watching a documentary.
And what was so amazing to me about that -- well he would be in his recliner , would holler for me to fetch the BB gun , and I ' d go get it.
Or we ' ll be here all day with my childhood stories.
And I was longing for several things that I wasn ' t getting , or not getting enough of.
So I decided , I ' m going to start my own biennial.
One of them , I call my Mimaw ' s Test.
And great art would have  " head "  : it would have interesting intellectual ideas and concepts.
And then I realized one day , there ' s an easier solution to this.
I ' m going to do an international biennial ; I need artists from all around the world.
So I decided , I ' m going to make this a real biennial.
Well the range is quite a bit.
I know I should mention : I ' m making all these things.
This is Nell Remmel.
And this is 22 feet long.
This piece was great . This is in my parents '  backyard in Arkansas.
And in her most recent project , it ' s called  " Weather I Made. " 
And so this is five-foot , five-inches of frost that she left behind.
And they were interested in developing a new , alternative art space , and they needed funding for it , so they decided to come up with some interesting fundraising projects.
Well this has sparked a craze in Japan , because everyone ' s wanting a masterpiece.
And in this one it ' s called  " Drawing the Short Stick. " 
This artist is Gus Weinmueller , and he ' s doing a project , a large project , called  " Art for the Peoples. " 
And using only what ' s present , he goes in and makes a little abode studio to work out of.
For this family , he made this still-life painting.
This project is called  " Love Nests. " 
This one ' s called  " Mixtape Love Song ' s Nest. " 
She ' s a very serious Swiss artist.
So this life price is for an irrigation non-profit director.
And this one had to get broken up.
So what they do is they move into an area and try to establish a new tradition in a small geographic area.
And we got a lot of attention when we did it.
So what happens is you dance on the grave , and after you ' ve done your dance , everyone toasts you and tells you how great you are.
He is interested in how we see as an animal , how we are interested in mimicry and camouflage.
And this piece : those aren ' t actually leaves.
Those are actually all real butterfly specimens.
But it ' s actually a painting.
So that ' s what she did.
And this is from a documentary called  " Sexual Practices and Populations Control Among the Uvulites. " 
It was so funny having a fake person who was making fake things.
So this is one of their comments on how over-coddled we ' ve become.
And he ' s reworking a Confucian art tradition of scholar stones.
He even once traded a work of art for a block of government cheese because the person wanted it so badly.
This is from a short film of hers called  " The Last Person. " 
And this is from a large traveling sculpture project that he ' s doing.
This is by Z . Zhou , and he ' s interested in stasis.
You can ' t look her directly in the eyes because she ' s kind of scary.
This is from a short film ,  " Adventures with Skinny. " 
Thank you . Thank you.
art,design,engineering,math,origami,space
And you would think that should have nothing to do with one another , but I hope by the end of these 18 minutes , you ' ll see a little bit of a relation.
And that is what origami used to be.
You know , it ' s very old . This is a plate from 1797.
So this art has been around for hundreds of years , and you would think something that ' s been around that long -- so restrictive , folding only -- everything that could be done has been done a long time ago.
Harkening back to Susan Blackmore ' s talk , we now have a means of transmitting information with heredity and selection , and we know where that leads.
Naturalism . Detail.
That is , people applied mathematical principles to the art , to discover the underlying laws.
And I want to tell you how we did that in origami.
They have to obey four simple laws.
Nothing else.
All of origami comes from that.
So in origami , to obey these laws , we can take simple patterns -- like this repeating pattern of folds , called textures -- and by itself it ' s nothing.
Or you can ramp up and go up to 50 stars on a flag , with 13 stripes.
And I can put it in this simple equation.
I mean , a stag beetle -- it ' s got two points for jaws , it ' s got antennae . Can you be that specific in the detail ?  " 
I start with my idea . I abstract it.
Now the first step , pretty easy.
And I ' m going to show you all how to do that so you can go out of here and fold something.
How would you make a single flap ? 
Well , if I unfold it and go back to the crease pattern , you can see that the upper left corner of that shape is the paper that went into the flap.
There are other dimensions for flaps.
There ' s other ways of making flaps.
So now we ' re ready to scale up.
And here ' s where the dead people start to help us out , because lots of people have studied the problem of packing circles.
Those folds fold into a base . You shape the base.
And you say ,  " Well , you know , how simple is that ?  " 
And you just draw a stick figure , and it calculates the crease pattern.
Or you could do a moose.
And if folding a single praying mantis from a single uncut square wasn ' t interesting enough , then you could do two praying mantises from a single uncut square.
This -- you can put details , toes and claws . A grizzly bear has claws.
You can make multiple subjects.
Do a little more complicated instrument. " 
And sometimes you create high art , and sometimes you pay the bills by doing some commercial work.
Computers made things move , but these were all real , folded objects that we made.
One of the earliest was this pattern , this folded pattern , studied by Koryo Miura , a Japanese engineer.
Now , there is actually a little origami in the James Webb Space Telescope , but it ' s very simple.
But if you want to go higher and go larger than this , then you might need some origami.
So , imagine a lens the size of a football field.
How do you make a large sheet of glass smaller ? 
Folded lens , you divide up the panels , you add flexures.
And we developed a pattern together that scales to arbitrarily large size , but that allows any flat ring or disc to fold down into a very neat , compact cylinder.
Now , there is other origami in space.
And this example is the latter.
Airbag designers also have the problem of getting flat sheets into a small space.
And so they can do a simulation like this.
Well , the heart stent came from that little blow-up box that you might have learned in elementary school.
When you get math involved , problems that you solve for aesthetic value only , or to create something beautiful , turn around and turn out to have an application in the real world.
culture,economics,education,global issues,women
In my mother ' s day , she didn ' t go to college.
And they ' re starting to dominate lots of professions -- doctors , lawyers , bankers , accountants.
A few years ago , the Marlboro Man was retired and replaced by this much less impressive specimen , who is a parody of American manhood , and that ' s what we have in our commercials today.
If you think about this , if you just open your eyes to this possibility and start to connect the dots , you can see the evidence everywhere.
But the difference is that , back then , it was driven by a very passionate feminist movement that was trying to project its own desires , whereas this time , it ' s not about passion , and it ' s not about any kind of movement.
I myself have a husband and a father and two sons whom I dearly love.
I was reading headlines about the recession just like anyone else , and I started to notice a distinct pattern -- that the recession was affecting men much more deeply than it was affecting women.
And second , that the story was no longer just about the crisis of men , but it was also about what was happening to women.
Women , a majority of the workplace.
That particular headline comes to me from a market research firm.
It was young , single women who were the major purchasers of houses in the neighborhood.
Now , I ' ve just laid out the picture for you , but I still haven ' t explained to you why this is happening.
It means that the economy is dividing into high-skill , high-wage jobs and low-skill , low-wage jobs -- and that the middle , the middle-skill jobs , and the middle-earning jobs , are starting to drop out of the economy.
You ' ll watch them both drop out of the middle class , but see what happens to women and see what happens to men.
The men sort of stagnate there , while the women zoom up in those high-skill jobs.
What it ' s about is that the economy has changed a lot.
But that really isn ' t true anymore.
If you look at management theory these days , it used to be that our ideal leader sounded something like General Patton , right ? 
But that ' s not what an ideal leader is like now.
Women enter the workplace at the top , and then at the working class , all the new jobs that are created are the kinds of jobs that wives used to do for free at home.
To see what ' s going to happen , you can ' t just look at the workforce that is now , you have to look at our future workforce.
People have asked men , why don ' t they just go back to college , to community college , say , and retool themselves , learn a new set of skills ? 
And what ' s even more disturbing is what ' s happening with younger boys.
Or that we require kids to sit still too much , and so boys initially feel like failures ? 
Noah : The girls are obviously smarter.
On the board today for losing recess tomorrow , only boys.
This whole thesis really came home to me when I went to visit a college in Kansas City -- working-class college.
And this was kind of a shocker to me.
The night after I talked to these college girls , I also went to a men ' s group in Kansas , and these were exactly the kind of victims of the manufacturing economy which I spoke to you about earlier.
So who were they ? 
So who ' s the man now ?  "  he asked them.
And that ' s part of the reason I like to talk about this , because I think it can be pretty painful , and we really have to work through it.
In China , a lot of the opening up of private entrepreneurship is happening because women are starting businesses , small businesses , faster than men.
And if women failed to birth male children , they were basically treated like domestic servants.
And now look at the chart.
Now because we haven ' t fully processed this information , it ' s kind of coming back to us in our pop culture in these kind of weird and exaggerated ways , where you can see that the stereotypes are changing.
We have the charmless misanthrope.
You ' ve got Lady Gaga.
And so it feels like we have to move from this place where we ' ve got these uber-exaggerated images into something that feels a little more normal.
And we ' re always below the glass ceiling , the women.
So the image that I like to think of , instead of glass ceiling , is the high bridge.
There ' s no hole in the middle that you ' re going to fall through.
And husbands can drag their wives across , if their wives don ' t feel ready.

Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi on flow
And I tried , as a child , as a teenager , to read philosophy and to get involved in art and religion and many other ways that I could see as a possible answer to that question.
And the man who talked at that evening lecture was very interesting.
And I started reading his books after that lecture.
But this , for instance , shows that about 30 percent of the people surveyed in the United States since 1956 say that their life is very happy.
In fact , you can find that the lack of basic resources , material resources , contributes to unhappiness , but the increase in material resources does not increase happiness.
And the interview was 40 pages long.
Now ,  " ecstasy "  in Greek meant simply to stand to the side of something.
We know the temples they built , where people could come to experience a different reality.
We are participating in a reality that is different from that of the everyday life that we ' re used to.
Now he says also that this is so intense an experience that it feels almost as if he didn ' t exist.
That ' s why you can ' t hear more than two people.
His body disappears , his identity disappears from his consciousness , because he doesn ' t have enough attention , like none of us do , to really do well something that requires a lot of concentration , and at the same time to feel that he exists.
So what it ' s telling you here is that obviously this automatic , spontaneous process that he ' s describing can only happen to someone who is very well trained and who has developed technique.
And because all of these people I started interviewing -- this was an interview which is over 30 years old -- so many of the people described this as a spontaneous flow that I called this type of experience the  " flow experience. " 
And it describes the same effortless , spontaneous feeling that you get when you enter into this ecstatic state.
And you see here in this description of an Olympic skater , the same essential description of the phenomenology of the inner state of the person.
And like all of these successful and responsible CEOs say , you can ' t have just one of these things be successful if you want a meaningful and successful job.
This is an interesting little quote from Masaru Ibuka , who was at that time starting out Sony without any money , without a product -- they didn ' t have a product , they didn ' t have anything , but they had an idea.
And regardless of the culture , regardless of education or whatever , there are these seven conditions that seem to be there when a person is in flow.
In our studies , we represent the everyday life of people in this simple scheme.
That would be your mean level of challenge and skill , which will be different from that of anybody else.
And then the other areas become less and less positive.
Control is also a good place to be , because there you feel comfortable , but not very excited.
The other combinations of challenge and skill become progressively less optimal.
The largest single contributor to that experience is watching television ; the next one is being in the bathroom , sitting.
And some of you obviously know how to do that spontaneously without any advice , but unfortunately a lot of people don ' t.

I ' m going to talk now about how world population has changed from that year and into the future , but I will not use digital technology , as I ' ve done during my first five TEDTalks.
In the developing world , she said , they had two billion people.
And their aspiration was to buy a car.
They were saving to be able to buy a pair of shoes.
And that ' s what I ' m going to show you , because since 1960 what has happened in the world up to 2010 is that a staggering four billion people have been added to the world population.
A lot of companies have happened to grow the economy , so the Western population moved over to here.
And the most successful of the developing countries , they have moved on , you know , and they have become emerging economies , we call them.
And the tragedy is that the two billion over here that is struggling for food and shoes , they are still almost as poor as they were 50 years ago.
But the distance from the poorest here , the very poorest , to the very richest over here is wider than ever.
Well , I ' m going to project into 2050.
They will start flying.
This is what we will find there.
Well , here population [growth] comes in because there [among emerging economies] we already have two to three children per woman , family planning is widely used , and population growth is coming to an end.
Because we already have this [growth] in process.
Here I have on the screen my country bubbles.
That ' s India and this is China . Size is population.
But look , this is the world my teacher talked about in 1960 : one billion Western world here -- high child-survival , small families -- and all the rest , the rainbow of developing countries , with very large families and poor child survival.
[When] they get up to 90-percent child survival , then families decrease , and most of the Arab countries in the Middle East is falling down there [to small families].
They are still up here.
That ' s why investments by Gates Foundation , UNICEF and aid organizations , together with national government in the poorest countries , are so good ; because they are actually helping us to reach a sustainable population size of the world.
And will it happen ? 
It can be done.
Remember when this blue box was all alone , leading the world , living its own life.
Do it well and get used to it.
biology,chemistry,disease,health,medicine,science
At the end of that time , I went off to Australia , about 20 years ago.
I could accept that.
And of course , they were right.
Within Britain , there is a gradient of health -- and this is what ' s called standardized mortality , basically your chances of dying.
So what accounts for this horrible space here between us up here in southern Scotland and the South ? 
This is after accounting for smoking , social class , diet , all those other known risk factors.
And we need vitamin D . It ' s now a requirement that children have a certain amount.
I distinctly -- nobody forgets cod liver oil.
But if you give people vitamin D supplements , you don ' t change that high rate of heart disease.
High vitamin D levels , I think , are a marker for sunlight exposure , and sunlight exposure , in methods I ' m going to show , is good for heart disease.
Now these three guys up here , Furchgott , Ignarro and Murad , won the Nobel Prize for medicine back in 1998.
And what was remarkable about it was in the past when we think of chemical messengers within the body , we thought of complicated things like estrogen and insulin , or nerve transmission.
So it ' s not just in the cardiovascular system it arises.
It ' s not the heart . What do you do ? 
And I first off started work in cell culture , growing cells , and then I was using knockout mouse models -- mice that couldn ' t make the gene.
It ' s a species close to human , with several advantages over mice : They ' re free , you don ' t shave them , they feed themselves , and nobody pickets your office saying ,  " Save the lab medical student. " 
We put on creams that blocked the enzyme that made it , we injected things . We couldn ' t turn off the nitric oxide.
Could the sun activate those stores into the circulation , and there in the circulation do its good things for your cardiovascular system ? 
Now , what we were careful to do was , vitamin D is made by ultraviolet B rays and we wanted to separate our story from the vitamin D story.
Not by much , as an individual level , but enough at a population level to shift the rates of heart disease in a whole population.
A few good things here : This appeared to be more marked in older people.
And the other thing I should mention was there was no change in vitamin D.
Now , one of the problems with looking at blood pressure is your body does everything it can to keep your blood pressure at the same place.
So we ' ve measured -- this is again , notice no tail and hairless , this is a medical student.
But the active irradiation , during the UV and for an hour after it , there is dilation of the blood vessels.
Different wavelengths of light have different activities of doing that.
If you live up here , in summer the sun is coming fairly directly down , but in winter it ' s coming through a huge amount of atmosphere , and much of the ultraviolet is weeded out , and the range of wavelengths that hit the Earth are different from summer to winter.
So Ventura is in southern California.
Edinburgh in summer , the area beneath the curve is pretty good , but Edinburgh in winter , the amount of NO that can be released is next to nothing , tiny amounts.
We think it probably accounts for a lot of the north-south health divide within Britain , It ' s of relevance to us.
And this is ongoing work , but dermatologists -- I mean , I ' m a dermatologist.
And I think that we need to be more aware of , and we need to find the risk-benefit ratio.
Bored in school , failing classes , at odds with peers : This child might be an entrepreneur , says Cameron Herold . At TEDxEdmonton , he makes the case for parenting and education that helps would-be entrepreneurs flourish -- as kids and as adults.
I would be willing to bet that I ' m the dumbest guy in the room because I couldn ' t get through school . I struggled with school.
We get told that we need to study harder or be more focused or get a tutor.
When I was in grade two , I won a city-wide speaking competition , but nobody had ever said ,  " Hey , this kid ' s a good speaker.
So as kids show these traits -- and we need to start looking for them -- I think we should be raising kids to be entrepreneurs instead of lawyers.
We have the ability to get those groups of people around us that want to kind of build that dream with us , and I think if we could get kids to embrace the idea at a young age of being entrepreneurial , we could change everything in the world that is a problem today.
If you teach a man to fish , you feed him for a lifetime. " 
Right now we teach our kids to go after really good jobs , you know , and the school system teaches them to go after things like being a doctor and being a lawyer and being an accountant and a dentist and a teacher and a pilot.
They teach them to go work in corporations.
I look at even my family.
We didn ' t fit in the normal work . We couldn ' t work for somebody else because we ' re too stubborn and we have all these other traits.
I have 18 out of the 19 signs of attention deficit disorder diagnosed.
Do you know that bipolar disorder is nicknamed the CEO disease ? 
Kids -- you can see these signs in kids.
We fast-track . We figure out the game.
So I just figured that out earlier.
I open up chapter eight talking about budgeting.
The definition of an entrepreneur is  " a person who organizes , operates and assumes the risk of a business venture. " 
And we ' ve heard those things about  " is it nurture or is it nature, "  right ? 
When I was growing up as a young kid , I had no choice , because I was taught at a very early , young age -- when my dad realized I wasn ' t going to fit into everything else that was being taught to me in school -- that he could teach me to figure out business at an early age.
And my mom came into the room and she said ,  " Where are you going to get the coat hangers to sell to the dry cleaners ?  " 
Because , when I told her I was going out to play with the kids , I was going door to door in the neighborhood to collect coat hangers to put in the basement to sell.
And I knew she wouldn ' t want me to go get them , so I just did it anyway.
At seven years old I figured it out . I got three and a half cents for a thousand coat hangers.
And I remember this one customer so vividly because I also did some other stuff with these clients.
And he ' s like ,  " Well , we don ' t need one. " 
And I said ,  " This car here ' s got one license plate that ' s all crumpled up. " 
I learned that at a young age.
And then I would go back to the other end of the beach and sell them to the rich kids.
So that ' s obvious , right.
I also learned , don ' t reveal your source , because I got beat up after about four weeks of doing this because one of the rich kids found out where I was buying my comics from , and he didn ' t like the fact that he was paying a lot more.
So I would collect the tips and get payment.
By this point , I was definitely not going to be an employee.
I asked him what he did with it , and he said he just throws it out.
And I was actually collecting it from all the automotive shops in the area on my bicycle.
and making money off that too.
And I had these little pillows that I would sew up.
So I actually spray painted a whole bunch of them brown.
So I learned that lesson at a young age.
That if I land this client once , and every week I get paid by that person , that ' s way better than trying to sell one clothespin thing to one person.
I would caddy , I would go to the golf course and caddy for people.
I would carry their golf bags up to the top , and they ' d pay me a dollar.
Every week , I would go to the corner store and buy all these pops.
And I had this captured market . You didn ' t need contracts.
But everybody else was looking in the bush and looking in the ditches for golf balls.
You can ' t do it on stage.
I packaged them up three ways.
And then I ' d sell 50 at a time of all the crappy ones.
But it paid the bills.
And I think I was 14.
Supply , demand , big opportunity.
Why don ' t you teach them not to waste money ? 
Allowances teach kids the wrong habits.
That ' s wrong , for me , if you want to raise entrepreneurs.
And then you know what we do ?  We negotiate.
You breed that kind of stuff . Each of my kids has two piggy banks.
They walk up with me . Every year all the money in the bank goes to their broker.
Shit , you ' ve missed 25 years.
Why don ' t you sit down with kids and give them four items , a red shirt , a blue tie , a kangaroo and a laptop , and have them tell a story about those four things ? 
Get kids to stand up in front of groups and talk , even if it ' s just stand up in front of their friends and do plays and have speeches.
When you see grumpy customer service , point that out to them.
We have all these lessons in front of us , but we don ' t take those opportunities ; we teach kids to go get a tutor.
But teach them how to fix the price , guess the price , pull up the photos.
Some of the entrepreneurial traits that you ' ve got to nurture in kids : attainment , tenacity , leadership , introspection , interdependence , values.
Don ' t medicate kids for attention deficit disorder unless it is really , really freaking bad.
We wouldn ' t have have that stuff , right ? 
But how about getting entrepreneurship to be ranked right up there with the rest of them as well ? 
These guys , Grasshopper.
http://www.ted.com/talks/anthony_atala_growing_organs_engineering_tissue.html
Anthony Atala on growing new organs
The kidney was indeed the first organ ever to be transplanted to the human.
But we have a major shortage of organs.
We ' re just getting older.
Trying to replace pancreas , trying to replace nerves that can help us with Parkinson ' s.
So , what can we do about it ? 
Wouldn ' t it be great if our bodies could regenerate ? 
Salamanders have this amazing capacity to regenerate.
You see the scar form.
Actually , we can regenerate.
Your skin regenerates every two weeks.
It basically wants to fight off infection , and seal itself , whether it ' s organs inside your body , or your skin , the first reaction is for scar tissue to move in , to seal itself off from the outside.
This is the channel that connects the bladder to the outside of the body.
That ' s exactly what you see here.
And then , six months later on the right-hand side you see this reengineered urethra.
So , we do regenerate , but for limited distances.
The strategy here , is if a patient comes in to us with a diseased or injured organ , you can take a very small piece of tissue from that organ , less than half the size of a postage stamp , you can then tease that tissue apart , and look at its basic components , the patient ' s own cells , you take those cells out , grow and expand those cells outside the body in large quantities , and then we then use scaffold materials.
It ' s bringing the cells into the body . It ' s allowing the cells to regenerate new tissue , and once the tissue is regenerated the scaffold goes away.
But actually , before placing the scaffold into the patient , we actually exercise it.
What about other structures ? 
And we can then tubularize this scaffold.
You place the muscle cells on the outside.
It has the same conditions as a human body , 37 degrees centigrade , 95 percent oxygen.
And this is an X-ray showing you the patent , functional blood vessel.
They are not nearly as complex as hollow organs.
We then tease the tissue apart into its two individual cell components , muscle , and these bladder specialized cells.
We coat the inside with these bladder lining cells.
This actually shows the scaffold.
For the second phase of the trials we just had different sizes , small , medium , large and extra-large.
But there are other hollow organs that have added complexity to it.
We exercise these prior to implantation.
This is actually a simple solid organ like the ear.
This is actually digits that we ' re engineering.
Again , fairly more complex organs , but by far , the most complex solid organs are actually the vascularized , highly vascularized , a lot of blood vessel supply , organs such as the heart , the liver , the kidneys.
This is actually your typical desktop printer.
And this is actually still , of course , experimental , not for use in patients.
We actually take the donor liver , we use very mild detergents , and we , by using these mild detergents , we take all the cells out of the liver.
We then take this vascular structure and we can prove that we retain the blood vessel supply.
And you can see the vascular tree that remains intact.
And that ' s actually what you ' re seeing.
So , we stack these wafers together , using the kidney cells.
One of the things that I wanted to summarize for you then is what is a strategy that we ' re going for in regenerative medicine.
Why ?  Because they will not reject.
If you present with a diseased pancreas we ' d like to take cells from that organ.
So , we prefer organ-specific cells.
And we prefer cells that will not reject and will not form tumors.
Some of the work you saw today was performed by over 700 researchers at our institute across a 20-year time span.
So , I always like to show this cartoon.
And those are usually the basic scientists , The bottom is usually the surgeons.
And when we launch these technologies to patients we want to make sure that we ask ourselves a very tough question.
We started implanting some of these structures over 14 years ago.
She did not have a normal bladder . This is a segment from CNN.
And now I can just go and go out with my friends , go do whatever I want.
http://www.ted.com/talks/liz_coleman_s_call_to_reinvent_liberal_arts_education.html
Liz Coleman ' s call to reinvent liberal arts education
I was invited to meet with leading educators from the newly free Eastern Europe and Russia.
Having made that decision they came to the United States , home of liberal arts education , to talk with some of us most closely identified with that kind of education.
In truth , liberal arts education no longer exists -- at least genuine liberal arts education -- in this country.
But the price of its dominance is enormous.
The progression of today ' s college student is to jettison every interest except one.
Questions such as ,  " What kind of a world are we making ? 
In so doing , the guardians of secular democracy in effect yield the connection between education and values to fundamentalists , who , you can be sure , have no compunctions about using education to further their values : the absolutes of a theocracy.
But despite the attention paid to these efforts , they remain emphatically extracurricular.
When the astronomical distance between the realities of the academy and the visionary intensity of this challenge were more than enough , I can assure you , to give one pause , what was happening outside higher education made backing off unthinkable.
Accompanied by a squandering of the nation ' s material wealth that defied credulity.
Mastery of basic skills and a bare minimum of cultural literacy eludes vast numbers of our students.
Equally startling , from my point of view , is the fact that no one was drawing any connections between what is happening to the body politic , and what is happening in our leading educational institutions.
You can be sure Jefferson knew what he was talking about when he said ,  " If a nation expects to be ignorant and free in a state of civilization , it expects what never was , and never will be. " 
Enhancing the public good becomes a primary objective.
But the balances redressed , our shared purposes assume an equal if not greater importance.
But structures designed to connect , rather than divide mutually dependent circles , rather than isolating triangles.
The importance of coming to grips with values like justice , equity , truth , becomes increasingly evident as students discover that interest alone cannot tell them what they need to know when the issue is rethinking education , our approach to health , or strategies for achieving an economics of equity.
In the language of my students ,  " Deep thought matters when you ' re contemplating what to do about things that matter. " 
Mediation and improvisation also assume a special place in this new pantheon.
But so does the importance of content.
Social activists , business leaders , lawyers , politicians , professionals will join the faculty as active and ongoing participants in this wedding of liberal education to the advancement of the public good.
This discovery is transforming.
But it is a politics of principle , not of partisanship.
Think of it as a kind of secular church.
While these past weeks have been a time of national exhilaration in this country , it would be tragic if you thought this meant your job was done.
The problem is there is no such thing as a viable democracy made up of experts , zealots , politicians and spectators.
But this single-mindedness will not yield the flexibilities of mind , the multiplicity of perspectives , the capacities for collaboration and innovation this country needs.
If the question of where to start seems overwhelming you are at the beginning , not the end of this adventure.
You have a mind . And you have other people.
Internet,law,music,technology,web
And I ' m at a stage in life where I ' m yearning for my old days , so I want to confess to you that when I was a kid , indeed , I was a conservative.
You ' re thinking ,  " That ' s not what the Internets say. " 
Indeed , it drives me so nuts , let me just change this little fact here.
Finally , truth will be brought here.
Great , here we go.
Now , you know , I mean , a lot of people go to church.
They go to church , by which I mean , they do lots of things for free for each other.
They share , they give , they give away for free.
They are in many important places against markets.
Because they understand : There are places for the market and places where the market should not exist , where we should be free to enjoy the fellowship of others.
They first taught us about ecology in the context of natural resources.
Now , I know you don ' t believe me , really , here.
He ' s a terrible producer of videos , but it ' s great content , so I ' m going to give you a little bit of it.
This is this fantastic Brat Pack remix set to Lisztomania.
They decided they wanted to do the same.
Here ' s lesson number one.
But this is also basically just a group of friends having an authentic social moment and screwing around together.
And it ' s not just that it yields a different kind of product at the end , it ' s that potentially it changes the way that we relate to each other.
JS : One remix is about individuals using our shared culture as a kind of language to communicate something to an audience.
LL : And then , here ' s for me , the critical key to what Julian has to say ...
LL : Right . Bingo . Point.
Now , my concern is , we Dems , too often , not so much.
Indeed , Mickey Mouse himself , of course , as  " Steamboat Willie, "  is a remix of the then , very dominant , very popular  " Steamboat Bill "  by Buster Keaton.
Wildly different.
Now , tiny little quibble of a footnote : Sonny Bono , you might say , was a Republican , but I don ' t buy it.
Read the license.
There is no creator here to be recognized.
So the point is the Republicans here recognize that there ' s a certain need of ownership , a respect for ownership , the respect we should give the creator , the remixer , the owner , the property owner , the copyright owner of this extraordinarily powerful stuff , and not a generation of sharecroppers.
And for that sharing activity to happen , we have to have well-protected spaces of fair use.
Now , this explains the right-wing nonprofit Creative Commons.
And it explains the vast right-wing conspiracy that ' s obviously developed around these licenses , as now more than 350 million digital objects are out there , licensed freely in this way.
I created a video which was based on a Wireside Chat that I ' d given , and I uploaded it to YouTube.
imagining that I had this deep conspiracy to reveal the obvious flaws in the DMCA.
Now , interestingly , they still sold ads for that music , if you played the silent video.
And then in an extraordinarily Bart Simpson-like , juvenile way you ' ve actually got to type out these words and get them right to reassert your freedom to speak.
This is absurd.
Well , interestingly , in the last presidential election , who was the number one , active opponent of this system of regulation in online speech ? 
Let me come back to now , now when I ' m a little leftist -- I ' m certainly left-handed , so at least a lefty -- And I wonder , can we on the Left expect to build this ecology of freedom , now , in a world where we know the extraordinarily powerful influences against it , where even icons of the Left like this entertain and push bills that would effectively ban the requirement of open access for government-funded research ? 
So here ' s the lessons of openness that I think we need to learn.
It ' s a value of the limits in regulation.
Anyway , please join me in teaching these values.

As we design these things , we could be thinking about designing these invisible worlds , and also thinking about how they interact with our personal ecosystems.
The microbes in your mouth can freshen your breath , or not , and the key thing is that our personal ecosystems interact with ecosystems on everything we touch.
And I believe the answer is yes.
We wanted to get something like a fossil record of the building , and to do this , we sampled dust.
So I ' m going to show you now first what we found in the offices , and we ' re going to look at the data through a visualization tool that I ' ve been working on in partnership with Autodesk.
Let ' s take a look at what ' s going on in different space types in this building.
I told Tim ,  " If you could just see the microbes , it ' s kind of like being in Costa Rica . Kind of. " 
So the very first thing we wanted to do in this building was look at the air system.
And if you compare this to the microbes in a different air handling unit , you ' ll see that they ' re fundamentally different.
And that is exactly what we found.
All right , I ' m going to tell you one more story about this building.
When he met me and realized that it was possible for him to study in a quantitative way how his design choices impacted the ecology and biology of this building , he got really excited , because it added a new dimension to what he did.
What you ' re looking at is a signature of bacterial communities in the outdoor air , and how they vary over time.
What we found is that these rooms remained relatively stagnant until Saturday , when we opened the vents up again.
He felt like he had made a good choice with the design process because it was both energy efficient and it washed away the building ' s resident microbial landscape.
It ' s called BLIS , and it ' s been shown to both ward off pathogens and give you good breath.
Imagine it ' s late 1990 , and you ' ve just met a nice young man named Tim Berners-Lee , who starts telling you about his proposed system called the World Wide Web . Ian Ritchie was there . And .. . he didn ' t buy it . A short story about information , connectivity and learning from mistakes.
Well we all know the World Wide Web has absolutely transformed publishing , broadcasting , commerce and social connectivity , but where did it all come from ? 
Vannevar Bush was the U.S . government ' s chief scientific adviser during the war.
We don ' t work in terms of libraries and catalog systems and so forth.
And so he suggested a machine , and he called it the memex.
And nobody knew anything about it.
So spinning forward , one of the guys who read this article was a guy called Doug Engelbart , and he was a U.S . Air Force officer.
He built a system.
He was giving a presentation at the Fall Joint Computer Conference in 1968.
And you can see , he ' s working between documents and graphics and so forth.
The trouble with Doug Engelbart ' s system was that the computers in those days cost several million pounds.
And we delivered the world ' s first hypertext system.
The magazines started to cover it.
These are some examples of this system in action in the late 80s.
And the system was capable of doing very , very large documentation systems over computer networks.
And he told me about his proposed system called the World Wide Web.
I thought , well , you know , interesting , but a guy from CERN , he ' s not going to do this.
In 1993 , there was a table at the conference in Seattle , and a guy called Marc Andreessen was demonstrating his little browser for the World Wide Web.
There was a guy called Dick Rowe who was at Decca Records and turned down The Beatles.
And according to Fortune magazine , he ' s worth 700 million dollars.
Internet,animals,business,culture,entertainment,entrepreneur,oceans,web
In fact , they make their livings on this kind of stuff.
Basically all that means is that the democratic front page is the best stuff on the web . You find some interesting content , say a TEDTalk , submit it to Reddit , and the community of your peers will vote it up if they like it , vote it down if they don ' t.
Because in the last four years we ' ve seen all kinds of memes , all kinds of trends get born right on our front page.
These humpback whales were getting killed.
I believe this is a Farsi word for  " immortal. " 
In fact , someone on Reddit thought ,  " Oh , what a great thing , we should all vote this up. " 
And it wasn ' t long before other sites like Fark and Boing Boing and the rest of the Internet started saying ,  " Yes! We love Splashy Pants. " 
So they said ,  " No , no , just kidding . We ' ll give it another week of voting. " 
Facebook groups were getting created . Facebook applications were getting created.
78 percent of the votes , and to give you an idea of the landslide , the next highest name pulled in three . Okay ? 
Everyone wants to hear their news anchor say ,  " Mister Splashy Pants. " 
They even created an e-card so you could send your friend a dancing Splashy.
A few of them certainly were . But we ' re talking about a lot of people who were just really interested and really caught up in this great meme , and in fact someone from Greenpeace came back on the site and thanked Reddit for its participation.
Your link is just as good as your link , which is just as good as my link . As long as we have a browser , anyone can get to any website no matter how big a budget you have.
And the cost of iteration is so cheap that you might as well give it a go.
And that ' s the final message that I want to share with all of you -- that you can do well online.
Speaking at a TED Salon in London , economist Martin Jacques asks : How do we in the West make sense of China and its phenomenal rise ?  The author of  " When China Rules the World, "  he examines why the West often puzzles over the growing power of the Chinese economy , and offers three building blocks for understanding what China is and will become.
The world is changing with really remarkable speed.
A couple of weeks ago , I was looking at the latest projection by BNP Paribas for when China will have a larger economy than the United States.
China is going to change the world in two fundamental respects.
Secondly , for the first time in the modern era , the dominant country in the world -- which I think is what China will become -- will be not from the West and from very , very different civilizational roots.
It is not . It is also shaped equally by history and culture.
How do we try to understand what China is ? 
The first is this : that China is not really a nation-state.
Or immediately afterward , the Han Dynasty , still 2,000 years ago.
These are all things that come from the period of the civilization-state.
You can ' t run a place on this scale simply from Beijing , even though we think this to be the case.
Well , I think it has all sorts of profound implications.
It divided , and it ' s remained divided ever since.
You may remember what the Chinese constitutional proposition was.
When China gets its hands on Hong Kong , that won ' t be the case. " 
Think of German unification , 1990.
That is the nation-state mentality.
Let me offer you another building block to try and understand China -- maybe not sort of a comfortable one.
India , the United States , Indonesia , Brazil -- all of them are multiracial.
Well the reason , I think , essentially is , again , back to the civilization-state.
The great disadvantage of it is that the Han have a very weak conception of cultural difference.
Now the relationship between the state and society in China is very different from that in the West.
And it ' s obviously got nothing to do with democracy , because in our terms the Chinese certainly don ' t have a democracy.
It ' s had no serious rivals.
The Chinese view the state as an intimate -- not just as an intimate actually , as a member of the family -- not just in fact as a member of the family , but as the head of the family , the patriarch of the family.
Know that China believes in the market and the state.
The state is everywhere in China.
And the state , of course , its authority flows into lots of other areas -- as we are familiar with -- with something like the one-child policy.
and was finally completed in the seventh century A.D.
And yet we still insist , by and large , in thinking that we can understand China by simply drawing on Western experience , looking at it through Western eyes , using Western concepts.
It ' s arrogant in the sense that we think that we are best , and therefore we have the universal measure.
And Paul Cohen argues that the West thinks of itself as probably the most cosmopolitan of all cultures.
Whereas those cultures -- virtually the rest of the world , in fact , which have been in a far weaker position , vis-a-vis the West -- have been thereby forced to understand the West , because of the West ' s presence in those societies.
Now the largest economic region in the world.
What is happening is that , very rapidly in historical terms , the world is being driven and shaped , not by the old developed countries , but by the developing world.
There was a dramatic illustration of this actually a year ago -- Copenhagen , climate change conference.
And that is what is going to happen in the future.
Well , maybe that ' s true , maybe that ' s an exaggeration.
But this , alas , is no longer true.
This is the new Guangzhou railway station for the high-speed trains.
It travels on rails down a suburban road , and the cars travel underneath it.
Okay , so how would I like to finish ? 
For 200 years , the world was essentially governed by a fragment of the human population.
As humanists , we must welcome , surely , this transformation , and we will have to learn about these civilizations.
I think they ' re playing golf.
Musician and inventor Onyx Ashanti demonstrates  " beatjazz "  -- his music created with two handheld controllers , an iPhone and a mouthpiece , and played with the entire body . At TED ' s Full Spectrum Auditions , after locking in his beats and loops , he plays a 3-minute song that shares his vision for the future of music.
BeatJazz is : 1 . Live looping , 2 . Jazz improvisation And 3 .  " Gestural "  sound design.
a button , two guitar picks and lots of hot glue.
And  " BeatJazzers "  become as common as D.J. ' s.
TED Fellow Abigail Washburn wanted to be a lawyer improving US-China relations -- until she picked up a banjo . She tells a moving story of the remarkable connections she ' s formed touring across the United States and China while playing that banjo and singing in Chinese.
If you had caught me straight out of college in the halls of the Vermont State House where I was a lobbyist in training and asked me what I was going to do with my life , I would have told you that I ' d just passed the Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi , the Chinese equivalency exam , and I was going to go study law in Beijing , and I was going to improve U.S.-China relations through top-down policy changes and judicial system reforms.
♫ Shady Grove , my little love ♫ ♫ Shady Grove , my darlin '  ♫ ♫ Shady Grove , my little love ♫ ♫ Going back to Harlan ♫ That sound was just so beautiful , the sound of Doc ' s voice and the rippling groove of the banjo.
And I was sitting in a hallway one night and a couple girls came up to me.
And a record executive walked up to me and invited me to Nashville , Tennessee to make a record.
And the first song I wrote was in English , and the second one was in Chinese.
Go get it , girl.
And I see the power of music.
And they ' re like ,  " What ' s that girl doing ?  " 
It ' s just incredible.
And this little girl comes up to me.
She started singing her song.
I want to dwell in that light with you and with everyone.
1085
I was lost.
Except maybe French people.
She said ,  " Hey , JR , your wish is not to save the world , but to change the world. " 
What about art ? 
I was doing graffiti -- writing my name everywhere , using the city as a canvas.
So when I found a cheap camera on the subway , I started documenting those adventures with my friends and gave them back as photocopies -- really small photos just that size.
I mean , the city ' s the best gallery I could imagine.
I would change -- depending on the places I would go -- the title of the exhibition.
Then when the photo left , the frame was still there.
I mean , these kids , without control , throwing Molotov cocktails , attacking the cops and the firemen , looting everything they could in the shops.
I know those guys.
It was the only one I had at that time.
They were making scary faces to play the caricature of themselves.
That ' s where I realized the power of paper and glue.
So with my friend Marco , we decided to go there and see who are the real Palestinians and who are the real Israelis.
Asked them to make a face as a sign of commitment.
We launched the biggest illegal art exhibition ever.
The army will shoot you , and Hamas will kidnap you. " 
When we did the wall , we did the Palestinian side.
We did Face 2 Face with only six friends , two ladders , two brushes , a rented car , a camera and 20,000 square feet of paper.
We ' re pasting portraits -- so both portraits in the streets in a crowded market.
And then there was always a silence.
And most of them couldn ' t say.
The rain and the wind will take them off anyway.
We didn ' t push the limit ; we just showed that they were further than anyone thought.
When you go in these developing societies , women are the pillars of their community , but the men are still the ones holding the streets.
I just observed.
Most of the places I went to , I decided to go there because I ' ve heard about it through the media.
I was shocked.
When I arrived -- I mean , I didn ' t have any contact with any NGO.
We ' re hungry for culture.
The day after , I came back and they were already scratched.
They were all linked to the three kids that got killed.
The drug lords were kind of worried about us filming in the place , so I told them ,  " You know what ? 
And actually I ' ve been seeing it around me the last few days. " 
Everyone there understood the project.
They would have to film us from a really long distance by helicopter and then have a really long lens , and we would see ourselves , on TV , pasting.
So they had to go and find the women and get an explanation from them.
In war-torn places like Monrovia , people come straight to you.
Art . Just doing art.
Some who understood the project would explain it to others.
I think it ' s people ' s curiosity that motivates them to come into the projects.
Women are always the first ones targeted during conflict.
Then art becomes useful.
So I asked the people what happened.
Okay , India.
I heard culturally and because of the law , they would just arrest us at the first pasting.
 " Oh , you know , we ' re just doing art. "   " Art ?  " 
So we could just walk in the street during the next days and the photos would get revealed by themselves.
For each project we do a film.
Because that ' s a big part of it . There ' s layers behind each photo.
But to get it , they would have to [get] it signed by one of the women.
In Kibera , each year we cover more roofs.
So I have no responsibility to anyone but myself and the subjects.
And what ' s interesting is that fine line that I have with images and advertising.
Because this can be taken for advertising , and because of the law , it has to be taken down. " 
They asked me ,  " Please , make our story travel with you. " 
You understand the full scope of the project.
All right , recently I started a public art project where I don ' t use my artwork anymore.
So for example , I pasted the photo of the minaret in Switzerland a few weeks after they voted the law forbidding minarets in the country.
Art can change the way we see the world.
People say ,  " Oh , why don ' t you go in Iraq or Afghanistan.
So now my wish is : I wish for you to stand up for what you care about by participating in a global art project , and together we ' ll turn the world inside out.
I wanted that wish to actually start now.
What we see changes who we are.
http://www.ted.com/talks/lisa_gansky_the_future_of_business_is_the_mesh.html
I ' m speaking to you about what I call the  " mesh. " 
And we come from a long tradition of sharing.
All these things are share-platforms , but sharing ultimately starts and ends with what I refer to as the  " mother of all share-platforms. " 
More people , smaller spaces , less stuff.
Whereas before , we went with the big brands that we were sure we trusted.
It ' s also -- Web and mobile allow us to be connected and create all kinds of platforms and systems , and the investment of those technologies and that infrastructure is really our inheritance.
And so that sets up for making access to get goods and services more convenient and less costly in many cases than owning them.
Basically Zipcar is the largest car-sharing company in the world.
I think we can do that in Cambridge, "  brought it to Cambridge and they started -- two women -- Robin Chase being the other person who started it.
They made it sexy . They made it fresh.
They picked these sexy cars.
And so from a branding perspective , they got a lot right.
But when you ' re sharing a car and you have a car-share service , you might use an E.V . to commute , you get a truck because you ' re doing a home project.
And so it ' s not only an option for them , but I believe it ' s an imperative for Zipcar and other mesh companies to actually just wow us , to be like a concierge service.
What percentage of the time ? 
The number across the U.S . and Western Europe is eight percent.
In the last year , 2010 , two car companies started , one that ' s in the U.K . called WhipCar , and the other one , RelayRides , in the U.S.
Zipcar started a decade earlier , in 2000.
People are making anywhere between 200 and 700 dollars a month letting their neighbors use their car when they ' re not using it.
It allows us as owners to have other options.
It ' s just , how do we make that recurrent and scale it ? 
The opposite , as we know , is also true , often more true.
So creating Craigslist or iTunes and the iPhone developer network , there are all these networks -- Facebook as well.
So in this way , I think that cities are platforms , and certainly Detroit is a platform.
So , for example , city departments can open up transit data.
So I was having a coffee in Portland , and half-of-a-latte in and the little board in the cafe all of a sudden starts showing me that the next bus is coming in three minutes and the train is coming in 16 minutes.
The areas around it lack vitality and vibrancy and engagement.
Essentially , there are all sorts of restaurants in Oakland , near where I live.
An area that was edgy-artsy is now starting to become much cooler and engage a lot more people.
From my perspective , one of the things pop-up stores do is create perishability and urgency.
It allows us to test things as an entrepreneur , to go to market , to be in conversation with people , listen , refine something and go back.
I would just like to say that one of the big things , when we look at waste and when we look at ways that we can really be generous and contribute to each other , but also move to create a better economic situation and a better environmental situation , is by sharing failures.
But they were very transparent , or they had to be , in the way that they exposed what worked and didn ' t work.
I have a website -- it ' s a directory -- and it started with about 1,200 companies , and in the last two-and-a-half months it ' s up to about 3,300 companies.
http://www.ted.com/talks/raghava_kk_five_lives_of_an_artist.html
Raghava KK : Five lives of an artist
Thanks to a really boring lecture , I started caricaturing my teachers in school.
I ' m not on top of the class.
He had a good laugh at the other teachers and put it up on the notice board.
I have to tell you a little bit about my family.
She said ,  " Don ' t say that, "  but I ' m saying it anyway.
While he still held that worldview , I was 16 , I got the best lawyer in town , my older brother Karthik , and I sat him down , and I said ,  " Pa , from today onwards I ' ve decided I ' m going to be disciplined , I ' m going to be curious , I ' m going to learn something new every day , I ' m going to be very hard working , and I ' m not going to depend on you emotionally or financially. " 
But , to cut a long story short , I quit school to pursue a career as a cartoonist.
And mad and crazy and fun.
So I was flipping through the pages of the Times of India when I saw that the Prime Minister of India was visiting my home town , Bangalore.
I saw layers of security.
He said ,  " What are you doing here , Raghava ?  " 
I sat him down , I caricatured him , and since then I ' ve caricatured hundreds of celebrities.
The next slide I ' m about to show you , is a little more serious.
I was also asked to leave the organization , a cartoonists '  organization in America , that for me was my lifeline.
When I went traveling , I remember , I met this fabulous old man , who I met when I was caricaturing , who turned out to be an artist , in Italy.
I said ,  " Oh , my God . What is that ?  " 
I loved it . I thought there was something really beautiful about that.
You know , there are a hundred types of brushes.
They had to be larger than life.
It was so exciting.
That ' s Pepe Linares , the renowned Flamenco singer.
I called my friends , painted on their bodies , and had them dance in front of a painting.
And I saw my work come alive.
I started doing fashion.
This is a work , a library I designed for the Robin Hood Foundation.
They said ,  " Stop saying sorry . Say , my bad. " 
And these guys paint humongous paintings , and they look really good.
I said , in exchange for education in how to paint , I will support them , and I started a company.
And , in fact , I started painting on anything , and started sending them around town.
I lived in India . She lived in America.
So then I said ,  " Nets , what do I do ?  " 
But it turned out , after I sent the works to her , that her dad ' s friends , like most of you , are geeks.
So what we did was we rented a little van and we drove all over the east coast trying to sell it.
Notice one thing , we ' re equal here.
I loved the attention.
And I said ,  " Not just married . Let ' s invite everyone who ' s helped us , all the people who bought our work. " 
And I had a special installation in tribute to my in-laws.
My mother fell very ill.
I had shows booked up for another year.
I could not live this larger than life person.
The Bollywood stars who I would party with and buy my work disappeared.
If they wanted beauty , I said , this is the beauty I ' m willing to give you . It ' s politicized.
A very , very dear friend of mine came out of the closet , and in India at that time , it was illegal to be gay , and it ' s disgusting to see how people respond to a gay person.
It ' s a secret.
This time , not only did my collectors disappear , the political activists decided to ban me and to threaten me and to forbid me from showing.
This time I said let ' s try something different.
How can a family get dysfunctional ? 
My mother miraculously recovered after a serious operation , and this man was elected president of this country.
And this was just eight months ago.
It talks about mental incest.
These are just different cartoons.
I work with children all over the world , and that ' s an entirely different talk , but I want to leave you with one story that really , really inspired me.
They , in fact , told me three weeks.
And I drew it out for her.
For me , my art is my magic carpet ride.
development,economics,future,global issues,technology,third world
The best minds in the best institutions generally get it wrong.
Over 20,000 economists whose job it is , competitive entry to get there , couldn ' t see what was happening.
Urbanization , integration , coming together , leads to a new renaissance.
It took from the Stone Age to achieve that.
But there is an underbelly.
What happens in one place very quickly affects everything else.
A lot of this is driven by what ' s happening in technology.
Our computers , our systems will be as primitive as the Apollo ' s are for today.
It will create huge opportunities in technology.
This sort of ability to do everything in new ways unleashes potential , not least in the area of medicine.
Fantastic potential for regenerative medicine.
The capacity to create , as this mouse has been genetically modified , something which goes three times faster , lasts for three times longer , we could produce , as this mouse can , to the age of our equivalent of 80 years , using about the same amount of food.
How do we ensure that it creates a more inclusive technology , a technology which means that not only as we grow older , that we can also grow wiser , and that we ' re able to support the populations of the future ? 
The most dramatic changes will be the skyscraper type of new pyramids that will take place in China and in many other countries.
The war on talent , the need to attract people at all skill ranges , to push us around in our wheelchairs , but also to drive our economies . Our innovation will be vital.
And then , the systemic risks.
And so a new awareness will have to arise , of how we deal with these , how we mobilize ourselves , in a new way , and come together as a community to manage systemic risk.
And of course we need to worry about the individuals , particularly the individuals that feel that they ' ve been left out in one way or another.
That will be the challenge of the scholars , and of all of us engaged in thinking about the future.
We have to develop a new way of managing the planet , collectively , through collective wisdom.
It is vital that we do so.
creativity,culture,design,education,work
It ' s an idea for a new kind of school , which turns on its head much of our conventional thinking about what schools are for and how they work.
And we felt the most important priority was to bring together two sets of problems.
And after hundreds of conversations with teenagers and teachers and parents and employers and schools from Paraguay to Australia , and looking at some of the academic research , which showed the importance of what ' s now called non-cognitive skills -- the skills of motivation , resilience -- and that these are as important as the cognitive skills -- formal academic skills -- we came up with an answer , a very simple answer in a way , which we called the Studio School.
First of all , we wanted small schools -- about 300 , 400 pupils -- 14 to 19 year-olds , and critically , about 80 percent of the curriculum done not through sitting in classrooms , but through real-life , practical projects , working on commission to businesses , NGO ' s and others.
Underlying it was some very simple ideas that large numbers of teenagers learn best by doing things , they learn best in teams and they learn best by doing things for real -- all the opposite of what mainstream schooling actually does.
They found it much more motivational , much more exciting than traditional education.
And the business organizations thought we were onto something in terms of a way of preparing children much better for real-life work today.
And next year , we ' re expecting about 35 schools open across England , and another 40 areas want to have their own schools opening -- a pretty rapid spread of this idea.
And it spread because of the power of an idea -- so the very , very simple idea about turning education on its head and putting the things which were marginal , things like working in teams , doing practical projects , and putting them right at the heart of learning , rather than on the edges.
Other ones have a focus on health care , tourism , engineering and other fields.
They ' re not like all of you who can sit in rows and hear things said to you for hour after hour.
And I hope that a few of you at least can help us make that happen.

I had a very charming routine at the time , which was to wait until late in the evening when my parents were decompressing from a hard day ' s work , doing their crossword puzzles , watching television.
When I was seven I went to summer camp.
I was born premature . I was always very small.
But I would go in on occasion.
And I went wild eyed and thought I was going to die.
My inability to swim has been one of my greatest humiliations and embarrassments.
And went from swimming one lap -- so 20 yards -- like a drowning monkey , at about 200 beats per minute heart rate -- I measured it -- to going to Montauk on Long Island , close to where I grew up , and jumping into the ocean and swimming one kilometer in open water , getting out and feeling better than when I went in.
And I would like to share my art.
First principles , this is very important.
I started seeking out triathletes because I found that lifelong swimmers often couldn ' t teach what they did.
Even did lessons with Olympians -- nothing helped.
So here are the new rules of swimming , if any of you are afraid of swimming , or not good at it.
The problem is hydrodynamics.
The body is denser than water . 95 percent of it would be , at least , submerged naturally.
And you can see that he ' s extending his right arm below his head and far in front.
Here is an example of the stroke.
Small flick , and the only purpose of that is to rotate his hips so he can get to the opposite side.
Not their fault , honestly.
I ' ll be doing a swimming lesson later , for myself , if anyone wants to join me.
That ' s it . That ' s really all you need to know.
And I wouldn ' t even catch the response . A sad state of affairs.
My teachers assured me , they said ,  " Don ' t worry.
I arrived in Tokyo . Amazing.
So , But I didn ' t say  . I said ,  . Pretty close.
And a teacher came up to me and handed me a piece of paper.
And so it came to me in waves.
And that ' s pretty much my response.
Nothing worked until I found this.
As soon as I focused on this material , I took off.
This brings us to the point , which is , it ' s oftentimes what you do , not how you do it , that is the determining factor.
Having a native speaker allow you to deconstruct their grammar , by translating these sentences into past , present , future , will show you subject , object , verb , placement of indirect , direct objects , gender and so forth.
So ballroom dancing , implicit versus explicit -- very important.
And so I ended up walking like this.
Went in , paid my ten pesos , walked up -- 10 women two guys , usually a good ratio.
I was so concerned with her perception of what I was doing , that it exploded in my face , never to return to the ballroom dancing club.
She was very pissed off that I had pulled her from her advanced practice.
She came back . She goes ,  " Come on . I don ' t have all day. " 
And proceeded to look at -- I wanted to set competition so I ' d have a deadline -- Parkinson ' s Law , the perceived complexity of a task will expand to fill the time you allot it.
I interviewed these people because they all taught in Buenos Aires.
Long steps . So a lot of milongueros -- the tango dancers will use very short steps.
Thirdly , variation in tempo.
I want you to see part of what I practiced.
One of the most elegant dancers of his generation , known for his long steps , and his tempo changes and his pivots.
He didn ' t lead with his chest , which requires you lean forward.
That ' s just one benefit of that.
There are many different types.
Sometimes it shows you what you shouldn ' t do.
Take the analytical frameworks , the capabilities you have , apply them to old fears.
I ' ve spent the last two years trying to deconstruct the American public school system , to either fix it or replace it.
But I ask a lot of questions , and I would love your advice.

Einstein : Einstein.
E : Hi , sweetheart.
Since we ' ve arrived , there ' s been a constant buzz about all the exciting speakers here for the conference.
A lot of her research goes on in caves , which can get pretty dusty.
Well , Bob Russell was telling us about his work on nanotubes in his research at the microscopic level.
That is one big peanut . Since Einstein is a bird , she ' s very interested in things that fly.
Einstein , would you like to ride in Burt ' s spaceship ? 
It would be very dangerous if you fell down.
SW : Yeah . It ' s all a lot of hard work.
Can you get down ? 
SW : Do your head now.
Or maybe Stu just needs another backup singer ? 
SW : There you go . And , of course , if all else fails , you can just run off and enjoy a fun fiesta.
You were saying that you were really embarrassed , because you ' re in love with a pirate ? 
SW : Yeah , that ' s right . But you don ' t like to drink beer , Einstein.
She thinks Al Gore is a really good-looking man.
E : Yee haw.
Can you sing  " Happy Birthday "  to him ? 
E : Happy birthday to you.
Einstein , do you want to say  " hi "  to all the owls ? 
SW : And the penguin ? 
E : Ooh , ooh , ooh . Aah , aah , aah.
SW : And a pig ? 
SW : And how about those cats ? 
SW : What about a skunk ? 
SW : Yeah . You are a superstar.
E : I ' m special.
E : [Kissing noise] SW : And what do you say when it ' s time to go ? 
Jimmy Wales recalls how he assembled  " a ragtag band of volunteers, "  gave them tools for collaborating and created Wikipedia , the self-organizing , self-correcting , never-finished online encyclopedia.
In 1962 , Charles Van Doren , who was later a senior editor of Britannica , said the ideal encyclopedia should be radical -- it should stop being safe.
It ' s written using Wiki software -- which is the type of software he just demonstrated -- so anyone can quickly edit and save , and it goes live on the Internet immediately.
And so if you think about what that means , it means a lot more than just building a cool website.
So there ' s a lot of opportunities that are going to arise around Wikipedia all over the world.
So we ' ve got over 600,000 articles in English.
A lot of people think in a very English-centric way on the Internet , but for us , we ' re truly global . We ' re in many , many languages.
And what ' s interesting about this is the New York Times website is a huge , enormous corporate operation with -- I have no idea how many hundreds of employees.
And the way that we ' re organized is not like any traditional organization you can imagine.
We ' ve got over 90 servers now in three locations.
You could never afford to have a standby crew of people 24 hours a day and do what we ' re doing at Wikipedia.
And that ' s essentially our main cost.
So when you saw him make a ridiculous edit to the page about me , you think , oh , this is obviously just going to degenerate into rubbish.
So a lot of people have heard about the Wikipedia Bush-Kerry controversy.
What I actually said is , they ' re not contentious at all.
This came after I told the reporter that we had to lock it for -- occasionally a little bit here and there.
The real struggle is not between the right and the left -- that ' s where most people assume -- but it ' s between the party of the thoughtful and the party of the jerks.
So how do we do this ? 
So the biggest and the most important thing is our neutral point-of-view policy.
But we have this jargon term of neutrality , which has its own long history within the community , which basically says , any time there ' s a controversial issue , Wikipedia itself should not take a stand on the issue.
By having this firm neutrality policy , which is non-negotiable from the beginning , we ensure that people can work together and that the entries don ' t become simply a war back and forth between the left and the right.
So as soon as he made his change , it went to the recent changes page.
So my page is on quite a few volunteers '  watch lists , because it is sometimes vandalized.
But also that ' s some of the most interesting and fun things at Wikipedia , some of the new articles.
But it turns out that only about 18 percent of all the edits to the website are done by anonymous users.
These are the people who are doing the bulk of the site , and they are , in a sense , semi-professionals at what they ' re doing , that the standards we set for ourselves are equal to or higher than professional standards of quality.
The type of people who were drawn to writing an encyclopedia for fun tend to be pretty smart people.
When somebody goes and looks at -- they see that someone , an anonymous IP number , made an edit to my page -- that sounds suspicious -- who is this person ?  Somebody looks at it -- they can immediately see highlighted in red all of the changes that took place , to see , OK , well , these words have changed , things like this.
All of that stuff is just on Wiki pages.
There ' s no reason to have a big argument about it.
And so the method that arose organically within the community is the Votes For Deletion page.
So somebody says ,  " Delete it , please . Delete it -- it ' s not notable. " 
And what ' s interesting about this is that the software is -- these votes are just -- they ' re just text typed into a page.
Nobody else saw this but I found it in a book , and I found a link to a page that describes it , and I ' m going to clean it up tomorrow , so please don ' t delete it, "  then it would survive.
Rick Kay is a very famous Wikipedian who does an enormous amount of work with vandalism , hoaxes and votes for deletion.
So the Wikipedia governance model , the governance of the community , is a very confusing , but a workable mix of consensus -- meaning we try not to vote on the content of articles , because the majority view is not necessarily neutral.
And so you ' ve got a hint of that when I mentioned , like , Rick Kay ' s voice would carry a lot more weight than someone we don ' t know.
And I also like to say she ' s the only person who actually knows all the rules of Wikipedia , so ...
So if you look at most of the major free software projects , they have one single person in charge who everyone agrees is the benevolent dictator.
So as an example of why this has been -- or how this can be important : we recently had a situation where a neo-Nazi website discovered Wikipedia , and they said ,  " Oh , well , this is horrible , this Jewish conspiracy of a website and we ' re going to get certain articles deleted that we don ' t like.
They always think they ' ve got 40,000 members when they ' ve got 18.
I mean , this could happen and what if some group gets really seriously organized and comes in and wants to vote ?  " 
Of course , because of the free licensing , if I do a bad job , the volunteers are more than happy to take and leave -- I can ' t tell anyone what to do.
It strikes me that much of the textbooks that are used to educate our children are inherently biased.
It builds on the storyline of bloggers versus newspapers.
And I said ,  " Well , they don ' t all hate it. " 
But part of that is to fulfill our mission of giving an encyclopedia to every single person on the planet.
And so the Wiki books project is an effort to do that.
Why do we crave love so much , even to the point that we would die for it ?  To learn more about our very real , very physical need for romantic love , Helen Fisher and her research team took MRIs of people in love -- and people who had just been dumped.
I and my colleagues Art Aron and Lucy Brown and others , have put 37 people who are madly in love into a functional MRI brain scanner.
It was built by the grandest Sun King , of the grandest city-state , of the grandest civilization of the Americas , the Mayas.
And Mayan inscriptions proclaim that he was deeply in love with his wife.
After 1,300 years , these two lovers still touch and kiss from their tomb.
They pine for love , they live for love , they kill for love , and they die for love.
But love isn ' t always a happy experience.
Almost nobody gets out of love alive.
I ' ve never had the opportunity to say it before.
I remember what you said to me.
I am told you will go from here.
Goodbye , my love , goodbye. " 
Romantic love is one of the most powerful sensations on Earth.
We found activity in some cells called the A10 cells , cells that actually make dopamine , a natural stimulant , and spray it to many brain regions.
It ' s part of what we call the reptilian core of the brain , associated with wanting , with motivation , with focus and with craving.
You lose your sense of self.
Wild is love.
So anyway , we found activity in three brain regions.
As the poet Terence , the Roman poet once said , he said ,  " The less my hope , the hotter my love. " 
In this case , life ' s greatest prize : an appropriate mating partner.
As a matter of fact , Lucy and I have a little joke about this.
Last but not least , we found activity in a brain region associated with deep attachment to another individual.
So , what have I learned from this experiment that I would like to tell the world ? 
I think of all the poetry that I ' ve read about romantic love , what sums it up best is something that is said by Plato , over 2,000 years ago.
Like hunger and thirst , it ' s almost impossible to stamp out. " 
And it ' s got the three main characteristics of addiction : tolerance , you need to see them more , and more , and more ; withdrawals ; and last , relapse.
And she -- not only did the instant craving come back , but she had to pull over from the side of the road and cry.
Too old , too young , too scruffy , too stupid , and they won ' t do it.
And indeed , there are now three academic articles in which they ' ve looked at this attraction , which may only last for a second , but it ' s a definite attraction , and either this same brain region , this reward system , or the chemicals of that reward system are involved.
And I just simply say ,  " Hardly. " 
And in fact , sometimes I feel a little sorry for the chicken on my dinner plate , when I think of how intense this brain system is.
There are still many questions to be answered and asked about romantic love.
I know what happens in the brain , when you do become in love , but I don ' t know why you fall in love with one person rather than another.
Your childhood certainly plays a role , but nobody knows how.
And I have concocted a questionnaire to see to what degree you express dopamine , serotonin , estrogen and testosterone.
About 600,000 people have taken it in 33 other countries.
So , I will close with this . These are my older people.
These are two women.
This is intimacy to women.
I think it comes from millions of years of standing behind that -- sitting behind the bush , looking straight ahead , trying to hit that buffalo on the head with a rock.
Our challenge is to understand each other . Thank you.

I have also an audible altimeter.
YR : Exactly . There is a rescue parachute for the wing for two reasons : so I can repair it afterward and especially so nobody takes that , just on his head.
And you don ' t look like a crazy guy ; you ' re a Swiss airline pilot , so you ' re rather a checklist kind of guy.

Okay , so , most people only wondered that occasionally , like today , in breaks from whatever normally preoccupied them.
In every aspect of their lives , they wished for progress , just as we do.
Nothing new was learned.
Think how many discoveries they represent.
That all that , discovered in 40 years , had not been in the previous hundred thousand , was not for lack of thinking about stars , and all those other urgent problems they had.
But that ability to make progress remained almost unused , until the event that revolutionized the human condition and changed the universe.
What were people now doing for the first time that made that difference between stagnation and rapid , open-ended discovery ? 
But I ' ll have to backtrack a little first.
Which is why the Scientific Revolution had to have a wider context.
Authorities had been rejected before , many times.
Well , we ' ve seen that that can ' t be true.
In what language ?  Certainly not the language of mathematics , in which , Galileo rightly said , the book of nature is written.
What ' s wrong with us ? 
We don ' t see the origin of species.
Well , the classic empiricist answer is induction.
It was a photograph , not of space-time , but of an eclipse , with a dot there rather than there.
What we see , in all these cases , bears no resemblance to the reality that we conclude is responsible -- only a long chain of theoretical reasoning and interpretation connects them.
We see rocks.
Brains only detect nerve impulses.
It ' s always , as Karl Popper put it , theory-laden.
No . Contrary to what ' s usually said , testability is common , in myths and all sorts of other irrational modes of thinking.
And each year , she is magically compelled to return.
So if the ancient Greeks had only known that Australia is at its warmest when Demeter is at her saddest , they ' d have known that their theory is false.
And here is the crucial thing.
Because the explanatory role of Persephone ' s marriage contract could be played equally well by infinitely many other ad hoc entities.
She cools his domain with Spring air , venting heat up to the surface , creating summer.
And that is possible because the details of the original myth are unrelated to seasons , except via the myth itself.
Better put that up.
If they ' d been observed in phase , the theory would have been refuted.
So , being proved wrong by observation , and changing their theory accordingly , still wouldn ' t have got the ancient Greeks one jot closer to understanding seasons , because their explanation was bad : easy to vary.
The search for hard-to-vary explanations is the origin of all progress.
But the more important one is explanationless theories.
That the truth consists of hard to vary assertions about reality is the most important fact about the physical world.

I ' d like to start with a little experiment.
The World Health Organization estimates -- well , they make various estimates of the number of people who need glasses -- the lowest estimate is 150 million people.
Glasses are not very expensive . They ' re quite plentiful.
This is the ratio of optometrists to people in sub-Saharan Africa.
And the idea is you make eye glasses , and you adjust them yourself and that solves the problem.
So -- okay , I can now see that man running out there , and I can see that guy running out there.
Okay , so I ' ve made these glasses and ...
Now , these aren ' t the only pair in the world.
And they ' re in fifteen countries . They ' re spread around the world.
To do that -- this is an early example of the technology.
It has to be brought down because we ' re trying to serve populations who live on a dollar a day.
How do you distribute ?  How do you work out how to fit the thing ? 
What we ' ve done is to set up the Center for Vision in the Developing World here in the university.

There we lived with the Inuit in the tiny Inuit community of 200 Inuit people , where [we] were one of three non-Inuit families.
The snow and the ice were my sandbox , and the Inuit were my teachers.
I don ' t know why National Geographic has done this , they ' ve never done this before , but they ' re allowing me to show you a few images from a coverage that I ' ve just completed that is not published yet.
It ' s a spirit bear , or a Kermode bear.
I thought , my career ' s over.
Because National Geographic is a magazine ; they remind us all the time : they publish pictures , not excuses.
And I actually got to sleep within three feet of him , just in the forest , and photograph him.
My clock is ticking . Okay , let ' s stop.
Now they ' re saying the sea ice in the Arctic , the summertime extent is going to be gone in the next four to 10 years.
And what I ' m trying to do with my work is put faces to this.
Polar bears are amazing hunters.
And this bear swam out to that seal -- 800 lb . bearded seal -- grabbed it , swam back and ate it.
We ' re finding more and more dead bears in the Arctic.
I found a couple in Norway last year . We ' re seeing them on the ice.
They ' re going to get to land.
And they ' re not like the harbor seals that you have here.
This is a piece of multi-year ice that ' s 12 years old.
I wish I could spend half an hour telling you about how we almost died on this dive.
So really what the ice does is it acts like a garden.
I hope you appreciate yours.
After an hour in these conditions , it ' s so extreme that , when I go down , almost every dive I vomit into my regulator because my body can ' t deal with the stress of the cold on my head.
And he thinks I ' m saying ,  " Take my picture. " 
I dropped down in this ice hole , just through that hole that you just saw , and I looked up under the underside of the ice , and I was dizzy ; I thought I had vertigo.
And when you have low productivity in this , in ice , the productivity in copepods go down.
This whale could have been born around the start of the Industrial Revolution.
But they ' re forcing themselves to come up in these tiny little ice holes where they can breathe , catch a breath , because right under that ice are all the swarms of cod.
Even though that spirit bear moment was powerful , I don ' t think I ' ll ever have another experience like I did with these leopard seals.
They look positively prehistoric and a bit scary.
And that ' s when I got a story idea : I want to go to Antarctica , get in the water with as many leopard seals as I possibly can and give them a fair shake -- find out if they really are these vicious animals , or if they ' re misunderstood.
It doesn ' t work that way.
They ' re not these little harbor seals.
The boat starts to sink , they race back to the ship and get to go home and tell the stories of how they got attacked.
After five days of crossing the Drake Passage , we have finally arrived at Antarctica.
So we come around the cove in our little Zodiac boat , and there ' s this monstrous leopard seal.
And so this leopard seal grabbed another penguin , came under the boat , the Zodiac , starting hitting the hull of the boat.
And I looked at Goran , and I said to him ,  " Forget that. " 
And you purposed this stupid story to National Geographic.
And my legs were just trembling . I couldn ' t feel my legs.
She came racing up to me , engulfed my whole camera -- and her teeth are up here and down here -- but Goran , before I had gotten in the water , had given me amazing advice.
So she did this threat display for a few minutes , and then the most amazing thing happened -- she totally relaxed.
She grabs another one . She does this over and over.
You don ' t want to be too anthropomorphic , but I swear that she looked at me like ,  " This useless predator ' s going to starve in my ocean. " 
And so that didn ' t work.
This just didn ' t happen a couple of times.
Because she can ' t believe I can ' t eat this penguin.
She ' s trying to force-feed my camera , which is every photographer ' s dream.
She would not stop trying to feed me penguins.
What had happened was another seal had snuck in behind me , and she did that to threat display.
They are the most remarkable animals I ' ve ever worked with , and the same with polar bears.
And I ' m so passionate about it.
Thank you.
Modern buildings with floor-to-ceiling windows give spectacular views , but they require a lot of energy to cool . Doris Kim Sung works with thermo-bimetals , smart materials that act more like human skin , dynamically and responsively , and can shade a room from sun and self-ventilate.
I was one of those kids that , every time I got in the car , I basically had to roll down the window.
But it was also the signal that capped the use , or overuse , of energy-consuming devices.
Great , right ?  Well , we have similar problems in buildings.
Over time , the buildings got taller and bigger , our engineering even better , so that the mechanical systems were massive . They require a huge amount of energy.
So what do we do here ?  How do we pull ourselves and dig us out of this hole that we ' ve dug ? 
And this gets me back to my research.
What it is , it ' s a lamination of two different metals together.
It ' s called  " Bloom, "  and the surface is made completely out of thermo-bimetal , and its intention is to make this canopy that does two things . One , it ' s a sun-shading device , so that when the sun hits the surface , it constricts the amount of sun passing through , and in other areas , it ' s a ventilating system , so that hot , trapped air underneath can actually move through and out when necessary.
So this kind of proof of concept project has a lot of implications to actual future application in architecture , and in this case , here you see a house , that ' s for a developer in China , and it ' s actually a four-story glass box.
I ' m also looking at trying to develop some building components for the market , and so here you see a pretty typical double-glazed window panel , and in that panel , between those two pieces of glass , that double-glazing , I ' m trying to work on making a thermo-bimetal pattern system so that when the sun hits that outside layer and heats that interior cavity , that thermo-bimetal will begin to curl , and what actually will happen then is it ' ll start to block out the sun in certain areas of the building , and totally , if necessary.
The influence -- and if you have noticed , one of my spheres of influence is biology -- is from a grasshopper.
On the left , it ' s when it ' s cold and the thermo-bimetal is flat so it will constrict air from passing through the blocks , and on the right , the thermo-bimetal curls and allows that air to pass through , so those are two different components that I ' m working on , and again , it ' s a completely different thing , because you can imagine that air could potentially be coming through the walls instead of opening windows.
Psychologist Jonathan Haidt studies the five moral values that form the basis of our political choices , whether we ' re left , right or center . In this eye-opening talk , he pinpoints the moral values that liberals and conservatives tend to honor most.
Suppose that two American friends are traveling together in Italy.
So here ' s my question for you : which one of these two guys was more likely to have voted for George Bush , which for Al Gore ? 
It really is a fact that liberals are much higher than conservatives on a major personality trait called openness to experience.
You can understand why artists are so different from accountants.
The main researcher of this trait , Robert McCrae says that ,  " Open individuals have an affinity for liberal , progressive , left-wing political views "  -- they like a society which is open and changing --  " whereas closed individuals prefer conservative , traditional , right-wing views. " 
This is from some guy named Ted.
So , right now , please raise your hand -- down in the simulcast rooms , too , let ' s let everybody see who ' s here -- please raise your hand if you would say that you are liberal or left of center.
And please raise your hand if you ' d say you are right of center or conservative.
Because when people all share values , when people all share morals , they become a team , and once you engage the psychology of teams , it shuts down open-minded thinking.
So , if you think that half of America votes Republican because they are blinded in this way , then my message to you is that you ' re trapped in a moral matrix , in a particular moral matrix.
Now , because I know -- -- OK , I assume that answers my question.
Let ' s study some moral psychology and see where it takes us.
Developmental psychology has shown that kids come into the world already knowing so much about the physical and social worlds , and programmed to make it really easy for them to learn certain things and hard to learn others.
Built-in doesn ' t mean unmalleable ; it means organized in advance of experience. " 
That you find across cultures and even across species ? 
It gives us very strong feelings about those who cause harm.
This Norman Rockwell painting is called  " The Golden Rule, "  and we heard about this from Karen Armstrong , of course , as the foundation of so many religions.
It ' s only among humans that you find very large groups of people who are able to cooperate , join together into groups , but in this case , groups that are united to fight other groups.
We get to exercise some ancient , ancient drives.
It ' s based on more voluntary deference , and even elements of love , at times.
And while the political right may moralize sex much more , the political left is really doing a lot of it with food.
But as my son , Max , grows up in a liberal college town , how is this first draft going to get revised ? 
And my colleagues , Brian Nosek and Jesse Graham , and I , made a questionnaire , which we put up on the Web at www.YourMorals.org.
On the left , I ' ve plotted the scores for liberals ; on the right , those for conservatives ; in the middle , the moderates.
Same story for fairness.
In-group , authority , purity -- this stuff has nothing to do with morality . I reject it. " 
We find this in every country we look at.
Notice also that on all of these graphs , the slope is steeper on in-group , authority , purity.
This effect is so robust that we find it no matter how we ask the question.
Well , if you are a liberal , you say ,  " Hey , that ' s great! " 
But to a liberal , it sounds like this dog is running for the Republican nomination.
The answer , I think , is contained in this incredible triptych from Hieronymus Bosch ,  " The Garden of Earthly Delights. " 
We get every person doing whatever he wants , with every aperture of every other person and every other animal.
So this triptych , these three panels portray the timeless truth that order tends to decay.
So it ' s a really nice analog for all sorts of environmental issues , where we ' re asking people to make a sacrifice and they themselves don ' t really benefit from their own sacrifice.
But they quickly see ,  " You know what , other people aren ' t doing so much though.
If you want to give some of your own money to punish people who aren ' t contributing , you can do that. " 
It ' s not enough to just appeal to people ' s good motives.
Some people think that religion is an adaptation evolved both by cultural and biological evolution to make groups to cohere , in part for the purpose of trusting each other , and then being more effective at competing with other groups.
The Grand Canyon is really simple.
This is an absolute miracle , much harder to explain than the Grand Canyon.
But it really helps to organize a group if you can have sub-groups , and if those sub-groups have some internal structure , and if you have some ideology that tells people to suppress their carnality , to pursue higher , nobler ends.
They say ,  " Let ' s question authority. " 
So liberals speak for the weak and oppressed.
Conservatives , on the other hand , speak for institutions and traditions.
So as Edmund Burke said ,  " The restraints on men , as well as their liberties , are to be reckoned among their rights. " 
Think about yin and yang.
There are many high gods in Hinduism.
You have the markings of Shiva on the right , Shiva ' s the liberal god . And they work together.
The struggle between for and against is the mind ' s worst disease. " 
Can you be not for or against anything ? 
Am I telling you to embrace Seng-ts ' an and stop , stop with this struggle of for and against ? 
Because , as we just heard , everybody thinks they are right.
Step out.
So I think the point -- the point of my talk , and I think the point of TED -- is that this is a group that is passionately engaged in the pursuit of changing the world for the better.
http://www.ted.com/talks/stephen_coleman_the_moral_dangers_of_non_lethal_weapons.html
Stephen Coleman : The moral dangers of non-lethal weapons
In fact , a lot of the jobs that we ' re asking the military personnel to do in these situations are ones that , in their own countries , in Australia , the United States and so on , would actually be done by police officers.
So when we have to send someone , we send the military -- because they ' re there , they ' re available and , heck , they ' re used to going off and doing these things and living by themselves and not having all this extra support.
One particular thing that ' s come up that I am especially interested in is the question of whether , when we ' re sending military personnel to do these sorts of jobs , we ought to be equipping them differently , and in particular , whether we ought to be giving them access to some of the sorts of non-lethal weapons that police have.
If people are approaching these checkpoints and the military personnel there are unsure whether this person ' s hostile or not.
If this person doesn ' t follow directions , then they may end up shooting them and then find out afterward either , yes , we shot the right person , or , no , this was just an innocent person who didn ' t understand what was going on.
This photo is actually from one of the missions in the Balkans in the late 1990s.
Another suggestion has been , since we ' re putting so many robots in the field , we can see the time coming where they ' re actually going to be sending robots out in the field that are autonomous.
So you ' ve got traditional things like pepper spray , O.C . spray up at the top there , or Tasers over here.
It ' s essentially a big microwave transmitter.
It is a lot more sophisticated than a microwave oven , but it is basically boiling the water molecules in the very surface level of your skin.
So obviously there ' s a whole range of different sorts of non-lethal weapons we could give military personnel and there ' s a whole range of situations where they ' re looking a them and saying ,  " Hey , these things could be really useful. " 
The police -- and knowing because I ' ve actually helped to train police -- police , in particular Western jurisdictions at least , are trained to de-escalate force , to try and avoid using force wherever possible , and to use lethal force only as an absolute last resort.
And since we ' ve already had so many problems with police use of non-lethal weapons in various ways , I thought it would be a really good idea to look at some of those things and try to relate it to the military context.
So I actually started to investigate some of those issues and have a look at the way that police use non-lethal weapons when they ' re introduced and some of the problems that might arise out of those sorts of things when they actually do introduce them.
And I went and had a look at some of the figures here.
This is something they can use instead of a firearm in those situations where they would have previously had to shoot someone. " 
This is from a Australian Institute of Criminology report.
So you can see there were six deaths sort of leading up to it every year for a number of years.
That spike was all Victoria.
Anyone want to take a stab at the number of times , given how they ' ve introduced this , the number of times police in Queensland used O.C . spray in that period ? 
I ' m going to go out on a limb here and say that if Queensland police didn ' t have O.C . spray , they wouldn ' t have shot 2,226 people in those two years.
They ' re not obeying the directions that we ' re giving them , so we ' ll give them a shot of the O.C . spray.
One of those problems is that non-lethal weapons may be used indiscriminately.
And in fact , one particular instance where I think that actually happens where you can look at it was the Dubrovka Theatre siege in Moscow in 2002 , which probably a lot of you , unlike most of my students at ADFA , are actually old enough to remember.
And the Russian special military police , special forces , Spetsnaz , came in and actually stormed the theater.
They pumped the whole theater full of the gas.
Virtually everybody that got killed got killed from inhaling the gas.
The people you ' re going to be shooting at aren ' t going to be able to get out of the way.
So this non-lethal weapon was being used , in fact , in this case as a lethal force multiplier to make killing more effective in this particular situation.
The person who ' s spraying the O.C . spray is wearing a rubber glove to make sure they don ' t get contaminated and so on.
It happened while I was working as a research fellow at the U.S . Naval Academy.
And eventually she said to him  " Well I ' m going to get back in my car. " 
So she ' s 72 , and it ' s seen that this is the most appropriate way of dealing with her.
Or Florida :  " Police Taser six year-old boy at elementary school. " 
Just in case you think it ' s only going to happen in the United States , it happened in Canada as well.
I looked at it . I was really surprised.
Okay.
They ' re trained to be more restrained in the use of force than the military are.
They say ,  " Well , it ' s got to be something that ' s nasty enough that people don ' t want to be hit with this weapon.
So I think , yes , there may be ways that non-lethal weapons are going to be great in these situations , but there ' s also a whole heap of problems that need to be considered as well.

All of us are makers.
We don ' t just live , but we make.
It ' s a scraper bike ; it ' s called -- from Oakland.
Apparently it can.
There was one held in Detroit here last summer , and it will be held again next summer , at the Henry Ford.
Dale Dougherty : These are electric muffins.
We got there first.
So imagine a kid :  " Am I going to get wet ?  Am I going to get wet ? 
People are remaking things into fashion.
Now this one takes a little bit of explaining.
And here he ' ll explain a little bit about what it does.
So , are you a maker ? 
You ' re makers of food ; you ' re makers of shelter ; you ' re makers of lots of different things , and partly what interests me today is you ' re makers of your own world , and particularly the role that technology has in your life.
They want to figure out how things work ; they want to get access to it ; and they want to control it.
They ' re a little bit radical.
And I found this old video.
Makers and shapers and put-it-togetherers.
We made it , and we were connected to it that way.
So I like to think there was something going on there of the new generation of makers coming out of this , plus  " Psycho. " 
And I talked to his mom , and I ended up doing a story on him for a magazine called Kidrobot.
And then he didn ' t particularly like school that much , but he got involved in robotics competitions , and he realized he had a talent , and , more importantly , he had a real passion for it.
But he also moved here to meet other people doing what he ' s doing.
And there ' s probably even some new ones since I ' ve been here last.
Let me say that again : playing.
And you can ' t see this very well on the screen , but Arduino -- Arduino is an open-source hardware platform.
And I don ' t know if you can see it that well , but that ' s a mailbox -- so an ordinary mailbox and an Arduino.
There ' s all kinds of different things that you can imagine for that.
And there are industrial versions of this -- about 20,000 dollars.
One of the coolest things is , Makerbot sent out an upgrade , some new brackets for the box.
This is a radar speed detector that was developed from a Hot Wheels toy.
We just had an issue on space exploration , DIY space exploration.
In fact , these guys actually work for NASA , and they ' re trying to pioneer using off-the-shelf components , cheap things that aren ' t specialized that they can combine and send up into space.
And he says ,  " I could go there all day long and talk to people and share ideas for free. " 
And we ' ve got to get this into schools , or into communities in many , many ways -- the ability to tinker , to shape and reshape the world around us.

Virginia Postrel on glamour
And it comes in a male form , too -- very glamorous.
Well , it ' s certainly not this one.
But there is a glamour of industry.
This is the Hewlett-Packard garage.
And there is , of course , this glamour.
And it actually helps a lot more if you look in a very old dictionary , in this case the 1913 dictionary.
Glamour was a literal magic spell.
Glamour is a magic spell.
Hedy Lamarr said ,  " Anyone can look glamorous , all you have to do is sit there and look stupid. " 
You can go to the museum of Hollywood history in Hollywood and see Max Factor ' s special rooms that he painted different colors depending on the complexion of the star he was going to make up.
It may be to illuminate the star ; it may be to sell a film.
There is a process of  " idealization , glorification and dramatization, "  and it ' s not just the case for people.
It puts you into this special , special world.
What glamour is all about -- I took this from a blurb in the table of contents of New York magazine , which was telling us that glamour is back -- glamour is all about transcending the everyday.
It ' s a very glamorous portrait.
You don ' t see her eyes ; they ' re looking downward.
That ' s glamour : that ' s Michelangelo ' s  " Pieta, "  where Mary is the same age as Jesus and they ' re both awfully happy and pleasant.
So as I say , in religious art , you know , God is not glamorous.
What is it about Superman ? 
The less experience we have with them , the more glamorous they are.
The story is about where you ' re arriving , or thinking about where you ' re arriving.
Arches with stained glass -- even more glamorous.
You know , when you get , actually to this town it has reality.
In order to pull glamour off , you need this Renaissance quality of sprezzatura , which is a term coined by Castiglione in his book ,  " The Book Of The Courtier. " 
You don ' t think about how Nicole Kidman is maneuvering that dress -- she just looks completely natural.
Glamour is about editing.
Now , this was kindly lent to me by Jeff Bezos , from last year.
There are no cords.
You have to have mystery and you have to have grace.
And the answer is no , but of course it ' s really just a movie.
It ' s why barware is glamorous . Glamour is translucent -- not transparent , not opaque.
And of course glass block has that sense of translucence.
And the way we deal with that is we displace them -- we put them into a golden world , an imagined world , an age of heroes , the world to come.
You know , you buy that Viking range , this is what your kitchen will look like.
The perfect office -- again , no cords , as far as I can tell.
And some people get rich enough , and if they have their ideals -- in a sort of domestic sense , they get to acquire their perfect world.
What is your ideal , and also , what has been edited out ? 
It was criticized for glamorizing violence , because , look -- sunglasses and those long coats , and , of course , they could walk up walls and do all these kinds of things that are impossible in the real world.
You know , we ' re marching toward Utopia.
Because glamour can be very totalitarian and deceptive.
National Socialism is all about glamour.
I think glamour has a genuine appeal , has a genuine value.
And that ' s to take Isaac Mizrahi ' s advice and confront the manipulation of it all , and sort of admit that manipulation is something that we enjoy , but also enjoy how it happens.
David Hockney talks about how the appreciation of this very glamorous painting is heightened if you think about the fact that it takes two weeks to paint this splash , which only took a fraction of a second to happen.
There ' s a wonderful book called  " Crowns "  that ' s all these glamour pictures of black women in their church hats.
Sometimes under those hats there ' s a lot of joy and a lot of sorrow. "

Me was composed of stories , of cravings , of strivings , of desires of the future.
My body was often in the way.
It was a way of locating myself.
I never had babies because heads cannot give birth.
I did this in front of many strangers.
I began to see my body like a thing , a thing that could move fast , like a thing that could accomplish other things , many things , all at once.
It was to be conquered and mastered like the Earth herself.
I took more than my body had to offer.
My father was really kind to me on my 16th birthday , for example.
As a result of me talking so much about my vagina , many women started to tell me about theirs -- their stories about their bodies.
Some women became quiet and disappeared.
It was proof that I had not measured up , that I was old and not fabulous and not perfect or able to fit into the predetermined corporate image in shape.
But the more I talked about it , the more objectified and fragmented my body became.
I went to the Democratic Republic of Congo.
I heard an 80-year-old woman whose legs were broken and pulled out of her sockets and twisted up on her head as the soldiers raped her like that.
The raping of the Earth , the pillaging of minerals , the destruction of vaginas -- none of these were separate anymore from each other or me.
It arrived like a speeding bird smashing into a windowpane.
Suddenly , my cancer was a cancer that was everywhere , the cancer of cruelty , the cancer of greed , the cancer that gets inside people who live down the streets from chemical plants -- and they ' re usually poor -- the cancer inside the coal miner ' s lungs , the cancer of stress for not achieving enough , the cancer of buried trauma , the cancer in caged chickens and polluted fish , the cancer in women ' s uteruses from being raped , the cancer that is everywhere from our carelessness.
Now I am swimming in it.
I know that everything is connected , and the scar that runs the length of my torso is the markings of the earthquake.
And the catheters they shoved into me without proper medication made me scream out the way the Earth cries out from the drilling.
And gratefully , it didn ' t.
And I went to her house , and it was morning , and the morning New Orleans sun was filtering through the curtains.
And I said ,  " But what ' s the water part ?  " 
And she sang -- I mean her whole body sang.
It was all the lies that got told before and after.
It was the tears that were indistinguishable from the Gulf that were falling down my cheek.
It was the continuing devastating war in the Congo and the indifference of the world.
What I learned is it has to do with attention and resources that everybody deserves.
It was magic healers and aromatic oils.
It was a thousand hallelujahs and a million oms.
It was all these things in the water , in the world , in my body.

That is , maybe you have a mind , and everyone else is just a really convincing robot.
I think novelists put this best.
But as a scientist , I ' m interested in a different problem of other minds , and that is the one I ' m going to introduce to you today.
And yet , you put them together in a particular network , and what you get is the capacity to write Romeo and Juliet.
So I ' m going to tell you three things about this today.
And then finally , to show that some of the differences between people , in how we judge others , can be explained by differences in this brain system.
It ' s above and behind your right ear.
And this picture shows the average activation in a group of what we call typical human adults.
I ' m going to show you a little bit of that long , extended process.
And you know what pirates really like ? 
I really love cheese sandwiches. " 
And while Ivan is away the wind comes , and it blows the sandwich down onto the grass.
So Joshua has a cheese sandwich and he says ,  " Yum yum yum yum yum! I love cheese sandwiches. " 
Child : And then his went on the ground.
Ivan comes back and he says ,  " I want my cheese sandwich. " 
Oh yeah , you were right . He took that one.
Which sandwich is he going to take ? 
And he takes this one.
First , he predicts Ivan will take the sandwich that ' s really his.
And we can see the continuation of this process of learning to think about other people ' s thoughts by upping the ante and asking children now , not for an action prediction , but for a moral judgment.
RS : Should Ivan get in trouble for taking Joshua ' s sandwich ? 
Remember the five-year-old completely understood why Ivan took Joshua ' s sandwich.
RS : Should Ivan get in trouble for taking Joshua ' s sandwich ? 
So the first thing is that in children we see this same brain region , the Right TPJ , being used while children are thinking about other people.
And so , what we can see is that over the course of childhood and even into adolescence , both the cognitive system , our mind ' s ability to think about other minds , and the brain system that supports it are continuing , slowly , to develop.
And I ' m going to give that to you now.
But the powder is labeled  " Deadly Poison, "  so Grace thinks that the powder is a deadly poison.
Okay . Good.
Now she thinks the powder is sugar.
Where Grace thought the powder was sugar , because it was labeled  " sugar "  and by the coffee machine , but actually the powder was poison.
And what I ' m going to show you is what happened when we look inside the brains of people while they ' re making that judgment.
So that ' s good , but of course what we ' d rather is have a way to interfere with function in this brain region , and see if we could change people ' s moral judgment.
So I ' m going to show you a demo of this.
So now I ' m going to apply that same pulse to my brain , to the part of my brain that controls my hand.
And we can use that same pulse , now applied to the RTPJ , to ask if we can change people ' s moral judgments.
So their judgments of the case when everything was fine remain the same . They say she deserves no blame.
We have a special brain system that lets us think about what other people are thinking.
It ' s getting them wrong that is living.
RS : I ' m not.
I mean , you ' re clearly an incredible human being , but someone could take this knowledge and in some future not-torture chamber , do acts that people here might be worried about.
So it ' s not a surreptitious technology.
We changed their ability to judge other people ' s actions.
The whole research program here of studying the distinctive parts of the human brain is brand new.
And we don ' t know yet what the implications will be of understanding it.
Why does it seem to require these beings who sense things for us to operate ? 
CA : Why ? 
Journalist Carl Honore believes the Western world ' s emphasis on speed erodes health , productivity and quality of life . But there ' s a backlash brewing , as everyday people start putting the brakes on their all-too-modern lives.
What I ' d like to start off with is an observation , which is that if I ' ve learned anything over the last year , it ' s that the supreme irony of publishing a book about slowness is that you have to go around promoting it really fast.
And I think that -- that ' s not really surprising though , is it ? 
To borrow a phrase from Carrie Fisher , which is in my bio there ; I ' ll just toss it out again --  " These days even instant gratification takes too long. " 
And of course , we used to date and now we speed date.
So this -- the perfect solution for time-starved professionals who want to , you know , salute the sun , but only want to give over about 20 minutes to it.
And sometimes it takes a wake-up call , doesn ' t it , to alert us to the fact that we ' re hurrying through our lives , instead of actually living them ; that we ' re living the fast life , instead of the good life.
And my wake-up call came when I started reading bedtime stories to my son , and I found that at the end of day , I would go into his room and I just couldn ' t slow down -- you know , I ' d be speed reading  " The Cat In The Hat. " 
And one of them made reference to a series of books called  " The One-Minute Bedtime Story. " 
But thankfully , a light bulb went on over my head , and my next reaction was very different , and I took a step back , and I thought ,  " Whoa -- you know , has it really come to this ? 
And by the time I got off that plane , I ' d decided I wanted to do something about it.
And the second is , is it possible , or even desirable , to slow down ? 
In other cultures , time is cyclical.
It ' s a finite resource ; it ' s always draining away.
Time is scarce , so what do we do ? 
And I guess that the question is , is it possible to break free from that mindset ? 
And , in this kind of cauldron of moments and places and acts of deceleration , lie what a lot of people now refer to as the  " International Slow Movement. " 
I think also the explosion of the organic farming movement , and the renaissance of farmers '  markets , are other illustrations of the fact that people are desperate to get away from eating and cooking and cultivating their food on an industrial timetable.
So they might curb traffic , or put in a park bench , or some green space.
And millions of them around the world are turning to complementary and alternative forms of medicine , which tend to tap into sort of slower , gentler , more holistic forms of healing.
Sex . There ' s an awful lot of fast sex around , isn ' t there ? 
Now , you know , I like a quickie as much as the next person , but I think that there ' s an awful lot to be gained from slow sex -- from slowing down in the bedroom.
Now , we all laughed at Sting a few years ago when he went Tantric , but you fast-forward a few years , and now you find couples of all ages flocking to workshops , or maybe just on their own in their own bedrooms , finding ways to put on the brakes and have better sex.
And Europe is an example of that , and people finding that their quality of life improves as they ' re working less , and also that their hourly productivity goes up.
And if you go beyond sort of the country level , down at the micro-company level , more and more companies now are realizing that they need to allow their staff either to work fewer hours or just to unplug -- to take a lunch break , or to go sit in a quiet room , to switch off their Blackberrys and laptops -- you at the back -- mobile phones , during the work day or on the weekend , so that they have time to recharge and for the brain to slide into that kind of creative mode of thought.
But thankfully , there is a backlash there in parenting as well , and you ' re finding that , you know , towns in the United States are now banding together and banning extracurriculars on a particular day of the month , so that people can , you know , decompress and have some family time , and slow down.
And I think what ' s very revealing is that the elite universities , who are often cited as the reason that people drive their kids and hothouse them so much , are starting to notice the caliber of students coming to them is falling . These kids have wonderful marks ; they have CVs jammed with extracurriculars , to the point that would make your eyes water.
And that letter is called -- very revealing , I think --  " Slow Down! "  -- with an exclamation mark on the end.
And if that ' s not shaming enough , I got that ticket in Italy.
One is that speed is fun , you know , speed is sexy.
Are politicians making good decisions on my behalf ? 
You know ,  " he ' s a bit slow. "  It ' s actually synonymous with being stupid.
And good slow is , you know , taking the time to eat a meal with your family , with the TV switched off.
And I knew that when my book on slowness came out , it would be welcomed by the New Age brigade , but it ' s also been taken up , with great gusto , by the corporate world -- you know , business press , but also big companies and leadership organizations.
So all of that said , is it , I guess , is it possible ? 
I play squash and ice hockey , two very fast sports , and I wouldn ' t give them up for the world.
I no longer hear time ' s winged chariot drawing near , or at least not as much as I did before.
And perhaps , the most important measure of the success of this is that I feel that my relationships are a lot deeper , richer , stronger.
They need you to move at their rhythm.
It ' s become my reward at the end of the day , something I really cherish.
And he said to me , or he handed this to me , and I read it , and it said ,  " To Daddy , love Benjamin. " 
And I thought ,  " Yeah , you know , this slowing down thing really does work. "

How do you discover the uniqueness of a project as unique as a person ? 
Unfortunately , though , the site was separated from the river by McLean Boulevard so I suggested ,  " Let ' s reroute McLean, "  and that gave birth instantly to Friends of McLean Boulevard.
And so my first sketch after I left was to say ,  " Let ' s cut the channel and make an island and make an island building. " 
And there emerged a design : the galleries sort of forming an island and you could walk through them or on the roof.
But I was still troubled , and I was troubled because I felt this was capricious.
A toroid , for those who don ' t know , is the surface of a doughnut or , for some of us , a bagel.
And here ' s the building as it opened , with a channel overlooking downtown , and as seen from downtown.
Every piece of the building works.
I was asked to do a building , and I was given all the artifacts of clothing and drawings.
There ' s an anteroom with photographs of children who perished and then you come into a large space.
And then you descend to light and to the north and to life.
He is on a state visit . We took him on a visit to Yad Vashem , we took him to the children ' s memorial ; he was extremely moved.
We are going to build our national museum to tell the story of our people ; we ' re about to embark on that.
And I got to work and they took me somewhere down there , nine kilometers away from the town and the temple , and said ,  " That ' s where we have chosen the location. " 
And I recommended they do it right there , on that hill and this hill , and bridge all the way into the town.
And as you come from the north , it is all masonry growing out of the sand cliffs as you come from the Himalayas and evoking the tradition of the fortress.
And half a million people gathered for the celebrations ; you can see them on the site itself as the foundations are beginning.
They said ,  " Let ' s rebuild the museum. " 
Just cut the whole museum through the mountain -- enter from one side of the mountain , come out on the other side of the mountain -- and then bring light through the mountain into the chambers.
And at night , just one line of light cuts through the mountain , which is a skylight on top of that triangle.
And then , coming towards the north , it opens up : it bursts out of the mountain into , again , a view of light and of the city and of the Jerusalem hills.
That too was a competition , and it is something I ' m just beginning to work on.
The first sketch recognizes that the building is many spaces -- spaces where research goes on , conference centers , a public building because it will be a museum devoted to peacemaking -- and these are the drawings that we submitted for the competition , the plans showing the spaces which radiate outwards from the entry.
And this is where it is ; it ' s sort of evolving.
I ' d like to conclude by saying something ...
I have a quote that I like by a morphologist , 1917 , Theodore Cook , who said ,  " Beauty connotes humanity.
Twenty years ago , in a conference Richard and I were at together , I wrote a poem , which seems to me to still hold for me today.
He who considers himself the servant of his fellow beings shall find the joy of self-expression . He who seeks self-expression shall fall into the pit of arrogance.
What is a mistake ?  By talking through examples with his improvisational Jazz quartet , Stefon Harris walks us to a profound truth : many actions are perceived as mistakes only because we don ' t react to them appropriately.
Okay , I have no idea what we ' re going to play.
Okay , so first of all , let ' s welcome Mr . Jamire Williams on the drums , Burniss Travis on the bass , and Mr . Christian Sands on the piano.
You really are alive right here in this moment.
But that could have happened -- maybe , maybe not.
So the way I perceive a mistake when I ' m on the bandstand -- first of all , we don ' t really see it as a mistake.
So for example , if I played a color , like we were playing on a palette , that sounded like this ...
See , these all lie right inside of this general emotional palette that we were painting.
And at some point , Christian will introduce this note.
So someone could conceptually perceive that as a mistake.
He ' ll play it . I don ' t know how we ' ll react to it , but something will change.
The texture changed in the drums this time.
So jazz , this bandstand is absolutely amazing.
So how does this all relate to behavioral finance ? 
You have some people who do.
One , two , one , two , three , four.
This is a science of listening.
Watch . One , two , a one , two , three , four.
It ' s about being here in the moment , accepting one another and allowing creativity to flow.

Greetings to all of you from Pakistan.
But there are many other dimensions to Pakistan.
I hope that you will be able to see not just my Taliban-like beard , but also the richness and color of my perceptions , aspirations and dreams , as rich and colorful as the satchels that I sell.
Madame , would you like some of those orange bangles with the pink polka dots ? 
Do I matter , or really exist for you ? 
My name is Ahmed . I am an Afghan refugee from the Khyber agency.
My heart and drum beat as one.
But there are still over 650 million Indians , Pakistanis , Sri Lankans , Bangladeshis , Nepalese , who remain washed up on the shores of poverty.
Why should we do this as Indians and Pakistanis ? 
Chris Anderson : Fantastic . Just stay up here.
It felt like it was really important.
Thank you so much.

The Maldives , as I ' m sure you ' re aware , are a chain of islands off the southwest coast of India here.
But if you ' re a marine biologist , Maldives is not such a bad place to be.
I study fish , also the bigger things , whales and dolphins.
In Sri Lanka , if you go down to the south coast of Sri Lanka , during the northeast monsoon season , you can see blue whales very , very easily.
Now , monsoon , the root of the word  " monsoon "  comes from the word  " season. " 
And the way it works is , it comes from the southwest.
That ' s what brings the monsoon rain.
So , the wind is now coming from the northeast out of India , across the Indian Ocean , this way towards Africa.
This is a very beautiful species , it ' s called the Oriental Scarlet.
Little larvae hatch out in fresh water.
And they grow and grow by stages . And they climb out of the water , burst out , as the adult which we see.
It really does need fresh water.
But this guy is an exception.
And it wanders far and wide . We know that much about it.
This is , it seems a bit dull you know.
Because this dragonfly has a rather amazing story to tell.
Didn ' t notice them.
And they were there for some time . And then they were gone.
And I asked people about them and yes , they knew , but they didn ' t know anything , where they came from , or anything.
And the Maldives , and I ' m sure some of you have been there -- so here is home.
Average height , about that much above sea level.
So , it stays under the soil.
There is no surface fresh water.
Those of you who are Indian or spent your childhood here , let me have a show of hands , who of you -- not yet , not yet!
Maybe pulling bits off ?  I ' m not asking about that.
And I got a bit curious about it.
And there is the answer , 21st of October.
But in October , remember , we ' re still in southwest monsoon , Maldives is still in the southwest monsoon.
Are they coming from India against the wind ? 
It stretches about 500 miles , of course it ' s India here.
In Bangalore , a colleague there sent me information for three years , average , 24th of September , so late September.
And then the southernmost Maldives.
I didn ' t know.
I had a rigorous scientific transect.
And then they tail off , there ' s a few , but that ' s it.
Now , what I said was , you get the southwest monsoon going one way , and then it changes and you get the northeast monsoon going the other way.
So , if you ' ve got India here , when the front is up above India you ' re into the southwest monsoon.
I can be in the southwest monsoon.
So , I was quite pleased with myself . I thought wow , I ' ve tracked this one , I know how they come here . Then I scratched my head a bit , and that ' s okay , I know how they come here , but why do they come here ? 
Well , to cut a long story short , they ' re actually flying right across the ocean.
And I know because when you look at the rainfall , these particular insects , these Globe Skimmers breed in temporary rain water pools.
They ' re up , and they ' re off.
Nothing for these dragonflies . There is no more seasonal rain.
But they are incredibly good fliers . This particular species , it can fly for thousands of kilometers.
What ' s happening is they are breeding in the monsoon rains here.
But most of them are going to carry on . And next stop , perhaps only four or five days away is going to be East Africa.
Just last week the rains broke . The short rains broke and it ' s raining there now.
They ' ll hatch out in six weeks . By that time the seasonal rains have moved on . It ' s not there , it ' s down here.
The sun is overhead there . Summer rains in southern Africa.
So , the little fellow that hatches out here , he gets up into the air , he is automatically carried to where the rain is falling.
A complete circuit of the Indian Ocean.
Which , up until now has had the longest known insect migration.
And I only stumbled on this because I was living in Malé , in Maldives for long enough for it to percolate into my brain that something rather special was going on.
It ' s a falcon . It ' s called the eastern red-footed falcon , obviously.
It ' s the border , much of it is the border between China and Russia , up here in the far east.
But it ' s a pretty miserable place to be in the winter.
So , now they don ' t stop here , or even down here.
And then they strike out across the ocean , down to Kenya.
They have the most incredible journey , but several make the crossing from India to Africa . Includes this one , the hobby.
This time of year they cross back to Africa.
They make use of exactly the same winds.
An Indian Navy jet was flying off Goa , bang! In the middle of the night . Fortunately , a two engine jet got back to base , and they pulled the remains of one of these [Eurasian Rollers] out.
And the other thing , the other important factor for all these birds , all medium sized fellows , and this includes the next slide as well , which is a bee-eater.

Malcolm Gladwell : The strange tale of the Norden bombsight
And so many people , I guess , watch those videos.
And so I thought I would tell a story about someone who made one of the most precious objects of his era.
And of course , the Swiss can be divided into two general categories : those who make small , exquisite , expensive objects and those who handle the money of those who buy small , exquisite , expensive objects.
In fact , one of his classmates is a young man named Lenin who would go on to break small , expensive , exquisite objects.
In any case , Carl Norden emigrates to the United States just before the First World War and sets up shop on Lafayette Street in downtown Manhattan.
You ' ve got a plane that ' s thousands of feet up in the air , going at hundreds of miles an hour , and you ' re trying to drop an object , a bomb , towards some stationary target in the face of all kinds of winds and cloud cover and all kinds of other impediments.
And he comes up with this incredibly complicated device.
And he makes this complicated thing.
But he said , with the Mark 15 Norden bombsight , he could drop a bomb into a pickle barrel at 20,000 ft.
And the U.S . military spends 1.5 billion dollars -- billion dollars in 1940 dollars -- developing the Norden bombsight.
And for Norden as well , this device had incredible moral importance , because Norden was a committed Christian.
Well God ' s will was that the amount of suffering in any kind of war be reduced to as small an amount as possible.
So in the years leading up to the Second World War , the U.S . military buys 90,000 of these Norden bombsights at a cost of $14,000 each -- again , in 1940 dollars , that ' s a lot of money.
And it ' s carried in a box with a canvas shroud over it.
The Norden bombsight is the Holy Grail.
And of course , in wartime , conditions aren ' t perfect.
It ' s full of all kinds of gyroscopes and pulleys and gadgets and ball-bearings , and they don ' t work as well as they ought to in the heat of battle.
And the Norden bombsight doesn ' t work as well under those conditions.
It needs cloudless sky to be really accurate.
And the chemical plant comprised 757 acres.
And of those 10 percent that landed , 16 percent didn ' t even go off ; they were duds.
So in the 1930s , he hired a whole bunch of them , including a man named Hermann Long who , in 1938 , gave a complete set of the plans for the Norden bombsight to the Nazis.
We live in a time where there are all kinds of really , really smart people running around , saying that they ' ve invented gadgets that will forever change our world.
If you go to the Pentagon , they will say ,  " You know what , now we really can put a bomb inside a pickle barrel at 20,000 ft. " 
And their mission was to find and to destroy -- remember the Scud missile launchers , those surface-to-air missiles that the Iraqis were launching at the Israelis ? 
You know what the answer was ? 
Oh no , they were brilliantly accurate.
That ' s always been the harder problem when it comes to fighting wars.
Well it is the grandson of the Norden Mark 15 bombsight.
Well it ' s extraordinary.
But do you know what the crucial thing is ? 
I ' ve described to you the opposite of a success story.
There ' s a postscript to the Norden story of Carl Norden and his fabulous bombsight.
And that ' s the greatest irony of all when it comes to the Norden bombsight.
He thought he had designed something that would reduce the toll of suffering in war.
cities,communication,community,computers,entertainment,entrepreneur,life,technology
I ' m not going to show you a presentation . I ' m going to talk to you.
You know , I guess the first question is , why build a virtual world at all ? 
I was just always trying to make things.
I thought it would be neat to do that . And so I got up in the ceiling and I cut through the ceiling joists , much to my parents '  delight , and put the door , you know , being pulled up through the ceiling.
And so for me , I know that when the Internet came around and I was doing computer programming and just , you know , just generally trying to run my own little company and figure out what to do with the Internet and with computers , I was just immediately struck by how the ultimate thing that you would really want to do with the Internet and with computers would be to use the Internet and connected computers to simulate a world to sort of recreate the laws of physics and the rules of how things went together -- the sort of -- the idea of atoms and how to make things , and do that inside a computer so that we could all get in there and make stuff.
I also think that more generally , the use of the Internet and technology as a kind of a space between us for creativity and design is a general trend.
You know , another way to look at that , and related to the content and , you know , thinking about space , is to connect sort of virtual worlds to space.
Stop for a moment and ask , why that conceit ? 
In some sense , you would become someone else in that journey , because there wouldn ' t be -- you ' d leave society and life as you know it , behind.
And in fact , it ' s going to be so different than what we see here on earth that anything is going to be possible.
You know , to give you a size idea about scale , you know , comparing space to Second Life , most people don ' t realize , kind of -- and then this is just like the Internet in the early  ' 90s.
You can find exactly the same articles written about everything that people are observing.
So it gives you an idea of scale . Now , it ' s expanding very rapidly -- about five percent a month or so right now , in terms of new servers being added.
We ' re very sensitive to that as humans.
So it ' s a really large world already , in terms of the amount of stuff that ' s there and that ' s very important.
The last big thought is that it is almost certainly true that whatever this is going to evolve into is going to be bigger in total usage than the Web itself.
I ' d say I kind of think about the world as being information.
That ' s one way of organizing information , but there are two things about the way you access information in a virtual world that I think are the important ways that they ' re very different and much better than what we ' ve been able to do to date with the Web.
It ' s also more memorable if I show you that picture , and I show you C-H-A-I-R on a piece of paper.
And I think that ' s something that people have talked about for 20 years -- you know , that 3D , that lifelike environments are really important in some magical way to us.
It ' s essential to us . You can ' t escape it.
So that second point , that we inherently experience information together or want to experience it together , is critical to essentially , kind of , this trend of where we ' re going to use technology to connect us.
Asking for advice , rather than any possible way that you could just statically organize a map.
So let me stop there and bring John back , and maybe we can just have a longer conversation.
Philip Rosedale : I think that ' s great . That ' s such a deep question . Yeah.
You have to have that level of freedom , and so I ' m often asked that , you know , is there a , kind of , utopian or , is there a utopian tendency to Second Life and things like it , that you would create a world that has a grand scheme to it ? 
PR : The Kremlin , yeah . That ' s true . The whole complex.
It was an ability to kind of walk up close to somebody and have a more private conversation , but it wasn ' t instant messaging because you had to sort of befriend somebody.
We finally gave up , took it out of the code.
And we had -- we zoned it , you know : we put a nightclub , we put a disco where you could dance , and then we had a place where you could fight with guns if you wanted to , and we had another place that was like a boardwalk , kind of a Coney Island.
When you think about stuff that people have built that ' s popular -- JH : CBGB ' s has to close eventually , you know . That ' s the rule.
This is done entirely using , kind of , the tools that are built into Second Life , so the innate concept of becoming pregnant and having a baby , of course -- Second Life is , at the platform level , at the level of the company -- at Linden Lab -- Second Life has no game properties to it whatsoever.
And of course , the existence of an economy is another idea.
And then the second one is -- if they feel like it , and they ' re not going to do it in every case , but in many they are -- they want to actually be able to sell that creation as a way of providing for their own livelihood.
JH : The observation is , Philip has been accused of looking like a character , an avatar , in Second Life.
That ' s probably not very many.
Handlebar mustache . Kind of a Village People sort of a character.
It doesn ' t seem to have its own culture , and the sort of differences that exist in the real world aren ' t translated into the Second Life map.
That said , the evolution of , and the nuanced interaction that creates culture , is happening at 10 times the speed of the real world , and in an environment where , if you walk into a bar in Second Life , 65 percent of the people there are not in the United States , and in fact are speaking their , you know , various and different languages.
JH : Other questions ?  Right here.
So average age : 32 . I mentioned 65 percent of the users are not in the United States.
In terms of psychographic -- oh , men and women : men and women are almost equally matched in Second Life , so about 45 percent of the people online right now on Second Life are women.
But it ' s not a bunch of programmers.
They tend to be creative . They tend to be entrepreneurial.
I suspect that ' s possibly a euphemism for C student who spent a lot of time in his room ?  Is it possible ? 
Moved around a bunch -- had that experience too.
I wasn ' t , like , an obsessed -- you know , get A ' s kind of guy.
PR : Yeah , so let me restate that.
I guess , and you ' re asking , what do I think about that ?  How do I -- JH : What ' s your response to the people who would say , that ' s horrifying ? 
So , no amount of backpedaling or intentional behavior or political behavior is going to keep these technology changes from connecting us together , because the basic motive that people have -- to be creative and entrepreneurial -- is going to drive energy into these virtual worlds in the same way that it has with the Web.
I think generally , we were talking about this -- I think that generally being present in a virtual world and being challenged by it , being -- surviving there , having a good life there , so to speak , is a challenge because of the multiculturality of it , because of the languages , because of the entrepreneurial richness of it , the sort of flea market nature , if you will , of the virtual world today.
But I would say that -- and many other authors and speakers about this , other than me , have said , you know , fasten your seat belts because the change is coming . There are going to be big changes.
Buddhism,God,brain,culture,faith,global issues,happiness,peace,photography,religion
And so I just came , two days ago , from the Himalayas to your kind invitation.
There ' s the Mount Kailash in Eastern Tibet -- wonderful setting.
This is the hottest day of the year somewhere in Eastern Tibet , on August 1.
As a Frenchman , I must say that there are a lot of French intellectuals that think happiness is not at all interesting.
We like the ups and downs of life.
Now , let ' s come to happiness or well-being.
But then , if you look in the literature , East and West , you can find incredible diversity of definition of happiness.
Well , that would be fine if it was just a secondary preoccupation in life.
And that can also come from some kind of confusions.
Beautiful chocolate cake : first serving is delicious , second one not so much , then we feel disgust.
If I had to hear it 24 hours , non-stop , it might be very tiring.
And also , again , it can -- also , it ' s something that you -- it is not something that is radiating outside.
And so , I think the best definition , according to the Buddhist view , is that well-being is not just a mere pleasurable sensation.
Because we are speaking of a different level.
When you are surfing on the top , you are all elated.
So now , how is that ? 
So how do we proceed in our quest for happiness ?  Very often , we look outside.
And also , when things go wrong , we try to fix the outside so much , but our control of the outer world is limited , temporary , and often , illusory.
We know , by experience , that we can be what we call  " a little paradise, "  and yet , be completely unhappy within.
So now , at the opposite , we know a lot of people who , in very difficult circumstances , manage to keep serenity , inner strength , inner freedom , confidence.
So then , when we ask oneself how to nurture the condition for happiness , the inner conditions , and which are those which will undermine happiness.
And so , if we look from our own experience , anger , hatred , jealousy , arrogance , obsessive desire , strong grasping , they don ' t leave us in such a good state after we have experienced it.
We don ' t need the recognition . We don ' t need any gratitude.
Aren ' t those negative emotions , or destructive emotions , inherent to the nature of mind ? 
Consciousness is like a mirror that allows all images to rise on it.
This is the nature . It cannot be tainted intrinsically with hatred or jealousy because , then , if it was always there -- like a dye that would permeate the whole cloth -- then it would be found all the time , somewhere.
Mind training is based on the idea that two opposite mental factors cannot happen at the same time.
So , there are natural antidotes to emotions that are destructive to our inner well-being.
But , of course , each emotion then would need a particular antidote.
So then , it ' s a self-perpetuating process.
But we think we could sit on the cloud -- but if you go there , it ' s just mist.
So this is the principal of mind training.
It means familiarization with a new way of being , new way of perceiving things , which is more in adequation with reality , with interdependence , with the stream and continuous transformation , which our being and our consciousness is.
A violinist , as we heard , who has done 10,000 hours of violin practice , some area that controls the movements of fingers in the brain change a lot , increasing reinforcement of the synaptic connections.
Some of them who came to the labs , like in Madison , Wisconsin , or in Berkeley , did 20 to 40,000 hours of meditation.
This is the place where the meditators -- you can see it ' s kind of inspiring.
It deals with the state of compassion , unconditional compassion.
Here is the preliminary result , which I can show because it ' s already been shown.
So there ' s a basic line for people . And also , it can be changed.
Here , the -0.5 is the full standard deviation of a meditator who meditated on compassion.
But they found that -- this is after three and a half hours in an fMRI , it ' s like coming out of a space ship.
Some meditators , without trying to stop it , but simply by being completely open , thinking that that bang is just going to be just a small event like a shooting star , they are able not to move at all.
This is something that ' s going to determine the quality of every instant of our lives.
Yet , we spend surprisingly little time taking care of what matters most -- the way our mind functions -- which , again , is the ultimate thing that determines the quality of our experience.

http://www.ted.com/talks/spencer_wells_is_building_a_family_tree_for_all_humanity.html
Spencer Wells builds a family tree for humanity
And the opportunity to make a whirlwind tour of the world like that is utterly amazing , for lots of reasons.
There is so much diversity around the globe.
Well , that ' s what I ' m going to talk about today , is how we ' re using the tools of genetics , population genetics in particular , to tell us how we generated this diversity , and how long it took.
Do we all share a common origin , in fact ? 
And the second question is related , but slightly different.
It ' s therefore probable that Africa was formerly inhabited by extinct apes closely allied to the gorilla and chimpanzee , and as these two species are now man ' s nearest allies , it ' s somewhat more probable that our early progenitors lived on the African continent than elsewhere. " 
Around 23 million years ago , they appear in the fossil record.
And the ones that stayed on in Africa evolved into the gorillas , the chimpanzees and us.
If they were peering over your shoulder , you wouldn ' t leap back , like that . What about our human ancestry ? 
How do we study that ? 
The field of paleoanthropology , I ' ll argue , gives us lots of fascinating possibilities about our ancestry , but it doesn ' t give us the probabilities that we really want as scientists.
All dug up just west of here in Olduvai Gorge , by the Leakey family.
Which one of these guys am I actually related to ? 
You think you ' ve got a tough job ? 
But looking around the world at the diversity of humans , he said ,  " Well , you know , we seem to come in discreet sub-species or categories. " 
Human races that according to physical anthropologists of 30 , 40 years ago -- Carlton Coon is the best example -- had been diverging from each other -- this was in the post-Darwinian era -- for over a million years , since the time of Homo erectus.
Instead of going out and guessing about our ancestry , digging things up out of the ground , possible ancestors , and saying it on the basis of morphology -- which we still don ' t completely understand , we don ' t know the genetic causes underlying this morphological variation -- what we need to do is turn the problem on its head.
You start in the present , with relationships you ' re certain about.
But eventually , no matter how good you are at digging up the church records , and all that stuff , you hit what the genealogists call a brick wall.
Written in our DNA , in our genetic code -- we have a historical document that takes us back in time to the very earliest days of our species . And that ' s what we study.
It ' s composed of four subunits : A , C , G and T , we call them.
And the whole thing , if you add it all together , is over six billion nucleotides long.
Imagine the longest book you can think of ,  " War and Peace. " 
Same thing happens to our DNA as it ' s being passed on through the generations.
And it ' s by looking at the pattern of genetic variation , the pattern of these markers in people all over the world , and assessing the relative ages when they occurred throughout our history , that we ' ve been able to construct a family tree for everybody alive today.
The Y chromosome , the piece of DNA that makes men men , traces a purely paternal line of descent.
What ' s the take-home message ? 
Every piece of DNA we look at has greater diversity within Africa than outside of Africa.
No , the DNA tells a story that ' s very clear.
That tells us we were all still living in Africa at that time.
We ' re all effectively part of an extended African family.
Well , that ' s a big question . These  " why "  questions , particularly in genetics and the study of history in general , are always the big ones , the ones that are tough to answer.
The last ice age started roughly 120,000 years ago.
New York City , Chicago , Seattle , all under a sheet of ice.
Rather , Africa was drying out at that time.
So the whole world was drying out.
The evidence from genetic data is that the human population around this time , roughly 70,000 years ago , crashed to fewer than 2,000 individuals.
The ones on the left are from Africa , from around a million years ago.
We are in a period of long cultural stasis from a million years ago until around 60,000 to 70,000 years ago.
The stone tools become much more finely crafted.
We became much more social . The social networks expanded.
Look in the mirror . You ' re it . The reason you ' re alive today is because of those changes in our brains that took place in Africa -- probably somewhere in the region where we ' re sitting right now , around 60 , 70 thousand years ago -- allowing us not only to survive in Africa , but to expand out of Africa.
So those of you who are going on one of the post-conference tours , you ' ll get to see what a real savannah is like.
And when they reached Central Asia , they reached what was effectively a steppe super-highway , a grassland super-highway.
The changes that allowed us to do that , the evolution of this highly adaptable brain that we all carry around with us , allowing us to create novel cultures , allowing us to develop the diversity that we see on a whirlwind trip like the one I ' ve just been on.
And they got really excited about it . They liked the film , but they said ,  " You know , we really see this as kind of the next wave in the study of human origins , where we all came from , using the tools of DNA to map the migrations around the world.
And I said ,  " Well , you know , what I ' ve sketched out here is just that.
We ' ve just connected the dots . What we need to do is increase our sample size by an order of magnitude or more -- hundreds of thousands of DNA samples from people all over the world. " 
The field research that we ' re doing around the world with indigenous peoples.
Where am I indigenous to ?  Nowhere really . My genes are all jumbled up.
How often do you get to participate in a big scientific project ? 
You can order a kit . You can test your own DNA.
It ' s a charitable entity , basically a grant-giving entity that gives money back to indigenous groups around the world for educational , cultural projects initiated by them.
We ' ve just awarded the first Legacy Grants totaling around 500,000 dollars.
Backed by stunning illustrations , David Christian narrates a complete history of the universe , from the Big Bang to the Internet , in a riveting 18 minutes . This is  " Big History "  : an enlightening , wide-angle look at complexity , life and humanity , set against our slim share of the cosmic timeline.
First , a video.
And you ' ll now see the yolk and the white have separated.
An egg is a beautiful , sophisticated thing that can create even more sophisticated things , such as chickens.
And that ' s why that video feels a bit strange.
That ' s hundreds of times as many species as there are on Earth.
In pockets , there appear what my colleague , Fred Spier , calls  " Goldilocks conditions "  -- not too hot , not too cold , just right for the creation of complexity.
Each stage is magical because it creates the impression of something utterly new appearing almost out of nowhere in the universe.
Now , we , as extremely complex creatures , desperately need to know this story of how the universe creates complexity despite the second law , and why complexity means vulnerability and fragility.
So let ' s do it.
Imagine the darkest , emptiest thing you can and cube it a gazillion times and that ' s where we are.
It ' s incredibly hot.
Within the first second , energy itself shatters into distinct forces including electromagnetism and gravity.
That ' s twice as long as humans have been on this planet.
It consisted of huge clouds of hydrogen and helium atoms , and they have no structure.
What you see here , the blue areas are about a thousandth of a degree cooler than the red areas.
So where you get slightly denser areas , gravity starts compacting clouds of hydrogen and helium atoms.
From about 200 million years after the Big Bang , stars begin to appear all through the universe , billions of them.
If , like me , you ' re wearing a gold ring , it was forged in a supernova explosion.
And that is how our solar system was formed , four and a half billion years ago.
The next stage introduces entities that are significantly more fragile , significantly more vulnerable , but they ' re also much more creative and much more capable of generating further complexity.
So , chemistry is dominated by the electromagnetic force.
Well , first , you need energy , but not too much.
What you want is just the right amount , and planets , it turns out , are just right , because they ' re close to stars , but not too close.
In liquids , they can cruise and cuddle and link up to form molecules.
And deep beneath those oceans , at cracks in the Earth ' s crust , you ' ve got heat seeping up from inside the Earth , and you ' ve got a great diversity of elements.
Well , it ' s here that life introduces an entirely new trick.
Each rung contains information.
So the information spreads.
And what that means is that DNA is , in effect , learning.
For most of that time of life on Earth , living organisms have been relatively simple -- single cells.
And occasionally , there are disasters.
Humans appeared about 200,000 years ago.
But it is so slow.
The sad thing is , when they die , the information dies with them.
And that ' s why , as a species , we ' re so creative and so powerful , and that ' s why we have a history.
We can see it at work in the earliest stages of human history.
Farming was an energy bonanza.
And that brain is learning at warp speed.
So , here we are , back at the convention center.
But it also contains warnings.
And the same weapons are still here , and they are still armed.
And now , finally , this is what I want.
I thank you for your attention.

It ' s a program that Richard Thaler from the University of Chicago and I devised maybe 15 years ago.
Let ' s start with mortgages.
And then they blame the banks for being the bad guys who gave them the mortgages.
Then market stocks seize and we ' re like ,  " Wow.
Anyone ?  Wonderful.
How many of you have kids ? 
I would predict , if you ' re a representative sample , that many more of you insure your iPhones than your lives , even when you have kids.
How many of you spend a thousand dollars a year on lotteries ? 
So where does it take us ? 
And that ' s what I really want to focus on today.
We have on the screen a representative sample of 100 Americans.
They cannot have money go away from their paycheck into a 401 plan before they see it , before they can touch it.
They never get around to logging into a complicated website and doing 17 clicks to join the 401 plan.
One third of Americans.
One out of 10 are saving enough.
We have one person -- well , actually we ' re going to slice him in half because it ' s less than one percent.
We have to understand why people are not saving , and then we can hopefully flip the behavioral challenges into behavioral solutions , and then see how powerful it might be.
And during the break there would be a snack and you could choose bananas or chocolate.
I predict scientifically 74 percent of you will go for bananas.
Self-control is not a problem in the future.
We think about saving . We know we should be saving.
Let me now talk about another behavioral obstacle to saving having to do with inertia.
And in Germany , if you would like to donate your organs -- God forbid something really bad happens to you -- when you get your driving license or an I.D. , you check the box saying ,  " I would like to donate my organs. " 
Austria , a neighboring country , slightly similar , slightly different.
But when you get your driving license , you check the box if you do not want to donate your organ.
Doing nothing is very common.
Twelve percent are organ donors.
Inertia , lack of action.
Are we going to make them automatically join the plan , or are they going to be left out ? 
One more before we flip the challenges into solutions , having to do with monkeys and apples.
They still have an apple left.
We hate losing stuff , even if it doesn ' t mean a lot of risk.
So this notion of loss aversion kicks in when it comes to savings too , because people , mentally and emotionally and intuitively frame savings as a loss because I have to cut my spending.
We talked about inertia and organ donations and checking the box.
So we ' ve got these challenges , and what Richard Thaler and I were always fascinated by -- take behavioral finance , make it behavioral finance on steroids or behavioral finance 2.0 or behavioral finance in action -- flip the challenges into solutions.
We think we ' re going to save more next year.
It ' s an autopilot.
Well , maybe it shouldn ' t be just January.
So that is the program , embarrassingly simple , but as we ' re going to see , extremely powerful.
We invited them to save three percentage points more every time they get a pay raise.
I want , really , to think about the fact that saving four times more is a huge difference in terms of the lifestyle that people will be able to afford.
This is a real difference.
Let me wrap with two key messages.
This is really the tip of the iceberg.
The average actually , the record is in Singapore.
How many of you feel you have a solid plan for the future when it comes to post-retirement decisions.
There ' s a lot of opportunities to make it powerful again and again and again.

I am wearing the Al Gore in-ear monitors he wore on the Larry King show and I ' m hearing that transmission and not mine.
John , do you want to introduce the song ? 
So we are past our 1,000th show.
It was 19 degrees in St . Louis about a month ago and I ' m happy to report that this performance you are seeing today is the earliest we have ever performed.
Not all the facts are in about performing at 8.30 in the morning.
This song is called  " Asbury Park. " 
We want to get in as many songs as possible during our brief time here so this is the one to play.
We ' re taking calls live on stage here at TED in Monterey.
Hello . Who ' s there , please ? 
This is Eleanor Roosevelt.
I wanna talk to Randi.
Do you have a laminated badge , Eleanor ? 
Well , I think we ' re going to stop that part of the show.

Thank you all.

How are we going to introduce her ?  " 
The other said ,  " How much did we hire him for ?  " 
Maybe Elizabeth , this great icon , dancing ? 
Leicester : May I join you , my lady ? 
And how many of you did not get that ? 
You know , simple words lost in the quicksand of experience.
So I ' ve got to get there and be in complete panic.
And the studio executives , they would say ,  " Hey , look at Shekhar . He ' s so prepared. " 
I don ' t even know if it ' s honest.
So , ultimately , everybody ' s looking at you , 200 people at seven in the morning who got there at quarter to seven , and you arrived at seven , and everybody ' s saying ,  " Hey . What ' s the first thing ?  What ' s going to happen ?  " 
Until that hits you , you ' re not going to do the first shot.
 " You ' re a great actor , and I like to give to my actors -- why don ' t you show me what you want to do ?  " 
Panic is the great access of creativity because that ' s the only way to get rid of your mind.
[unclear] , you said that yesterday . I ' m just repeating it because that ' s what I follow constantly to find the shunyata somewhere , the emptiness.
You remember how India was . There was no pollution.
If it is not measurable , it does not exist.
And he said ,  " Son , it goes on forever. " 
What does forever mean ? 
What was my story ? 
But all before that there was a woodcutter.
So what is a story ? 
So that ' s as wide as we look at stories.
Alexander had a story that his mother used to tell him , and he went out to conquer the world.
I exist because there are stories , and if there are no stories , we don ' t exist.
Now , a film.
I have to tell a story in a much more elaborate way , but I have the potential.
Just talk about plot and say how wonderful you ' ll shoot the film , what the visuals will be. " 
What is wonderful is , at many times , the stories will contradict with each other.
So , the sequel to  " Elizabeth, "   " Golden Age. " 
There was Philip II , who was divine because he was always praying , and there was Elizabeth , who was divine , but not quite divine because she thought she was divine , but the blood of being mortal flowed in her.
And the mortal self was the girl that Walter Raleigh was sent , and gradually he separated her so she was free to be divine.
But I said ,  " But the storm won the Armada.
Of course , when I asked Cate Blanchett , I said ,  " What ' s the film about ?  " 
I said  " It ' s about mythology , the gods. " 
Remember , in the film , to me , both her and her lady in waiting were parts of the same body , one the mortal self and one the spirit self.
Bess Throckmorton ? 
Are you with child ? 
You ask my permission before you rut , before you breed.
Elizabeth : This is no time for mercy , Walsingham.
Bess : Yes.
This is not the queen I love and serve.
You no longer have the queen ' s protection.
Shekhar Kapur : So , what am I trying to do here ? 
The architecture is telling a story about how , even though she ' s the most powerful woman in the world at that time , there is the other , the architecture ' s bigger.
Not only that , why is the camera looking down ? 
And that ' s the moment where , in my mind , both Elizabeth and Bess are the same person.
So how do I start all this ? 
That struck a chord , and I said ,  " That ' s true. " 
And an idea started to develop.
And now , out of the mythology of that , I ' m starting to create a world.
They started to build flyovers to get from A to B faster , but they effectively went from one area of relative wealth to another area of relative wealth.
There ' s a mythology in India about -- where they say , and I ' ll say it in Hindi , [Hindi] Right . What does that mean ? 
And now , what happens is that the people of the upper city , they suck up all the water.
And , because democracy still exists , there ' s a democratic way in which you say  " Well , if you give us what [we want] , we ' ll give you water. " 
Everything ' s a contradiction.
But you get up at 4 a.m.
It ' s the effect of looking for harmony in the contradiction that exists in a poet ' s mind , a contradiction that exists in a storyteller ' s mind.
The whole idea of contradiction , but the acceptance of contradiction is the telling of a story , not the resolution.
Harmony is the suggestion of something that is embracing and universal and of eternity and of the moment.

It was a great success.
We had 15 to 20 , maybe 22 percent of the global Brazil-nut market.
50 companies signed up , 200 products came out , generated 100 million in sales.
And the people who made money from Brazil nuts were not the people who made money from cutting the forests.
We needed to be working on soy -- things that we were not focused on.
He said ,  " You can ' t wake a person who ' s pretending to sleep. " 
We ' ve got to wake up to the fact that we don ' t have any more and that this is a finite planet.
But in general , this is what we ' ve got.
Our work shows that we ' re living at about 1.3 planets.
For bankers , we ' d be living off the principal , not the interest.
Population growth ' s important , but it ' s also about how much each person consumes.
There ' s very good evidence -- again , we don ' t necessarily have a peer-reviewed methodology that ' s bulletproof yet -- but there ' s very good evidence that the average cat in Europe has a larger environmental footprint in its lifetime than the average African.
In 2000 , we had six billion people on the planet.
They ' re all going to consume twice as much as they currently do -- scientists , again , agree -- because income is going to grow in developing countries five times what it is today -- on global average , about [2.9].
We ' re not going to be able to do that.
We need to use less to make more.
But it basically raises a fundamental question : should consumers have a choice about sustainability , about sustainable products ? 
Okay , so let ' s be generous.
You don ' t.
Is a bad feeder lot operation for beef better or worse than a bad grazing operation for beef ? 
And there are many others.
Sustainability has got to be a pre-competitive issue.
We need Cargill to work with Bunge.
Everybody ' s got to work together -- China and the U.S.
We need to focus on the where , the what and the who.
We have to save these places if we want a chance in hell of preserving biodiversity as we know it.
Are we going to work with 6.9 billion consumers ? 
Again , a daunting task.
So , we went through our 15 commodities.
In fact , these names start coming up over and over again.
So 100 companies control 25 percent of the trade of all 15 of the most significant commodities on the planet.
Because if these companies demand sustainable products , they ' ll pull 40 to 50 percent of production.
We can ' t wait that long.
We need to begin to work with industries.
In salmon aquaculture , we kicked off a roundtable almost six years ago.
And yet , next week , we launch globally verified , vetted and certified standards for salmon aquaculture.
For the big companies , it ' s reputational risk , but more importantly , they don ' t care what the price of commodities is.
So it ' s the demand that brings them to the table.
Now what we ' re doing is bringing the CEOs of these 80 companies together to help twist the arms of the final 20 , to bring them to the table , because they don ' t like NGOs , they ' ve never worked with NGOs , they ' re concerned about this , they ' re concerned about that , but we all need to be in this together.
They ' ve funded research that shows that we can double global palm oil production without cutting a single tree in the next 20 years , and do it all in Borneo alone by planting on land that ' s already degraded.
Because Cargill has 20 to 25 percent of global palm oil.
We don ' t have to change the way a single Chinese company works if we get Cargill to only send sustainable palm oil to China.
Mars is also on a similar journey.
And what they see is that they need to improve chocolate production.
The rest of the land can be used for something else.
Now , the price of food , many people complain about , but in fact , the price of food is going down , and that ' s odd because in fact , consumers are not paying for the true cost of food.
This is the subsidy from nature.
This is called bundling . It ' s bringing those externalities back into the price of the commodity.
These companies have begun to think differently.
Whatever was sustainable on a planet of six billion is not going to be sustainable on a planet with nine.

And while this is not my first visit to the U.K. , I have to say that I am glad that this is my first official visit.
And I ' m honored to meet you , the future leaders of Great Britain and this world.
I wasn ' t raised with wealth or resources or any social standing to speak of.
My father was a city worker all of his life , and my mother was a stay-at-home mom.
But even as it got harder for him to walk and get dressed in the morning -- I saw him struggle more and more -- my father never complained about his struggle.
I am an example of what ' s possible when girls from the very beginning of their lives are loved and nurtured by the people around them.
I was also fortunate enough to be cherished and encouraged by some strong male role models as well , including my father , my brother , uncles and grandfathers.
They taught me about what it means to be a father and to raise a family.
And his date was to go with him to a community meeting.
As he talked to the residents in that community center , he talked about two concepts.
And sometimes we settle for the world as it is , even when it doesn ' t reflect our values and aspirations.
And he urged the people in that meeting , in that community , to devote themselves to closing the gap between those two ideas , to work together to try to make the world as it is and the world as it should be , one and the same.
Not just for yourselves , but for your generation and generations to come.
And that ' s important to keep in mind.
The difference between a languishing nation and one that will flourish is the recognition that we need equal access to education for both boys and girls.
They knew no other way to live than to follow their dreams.
Please remember that.
I loved getting As.
And you too , with these same values , can control your own destiny.
Your success will be determined by your own fortitude , your own confidence , your own individual hard work.
But you have everything you need.
In the White House , there ' s the desk that he sits at -- it ' s called the Resolute desk.
And I hope in pursuing your dreams , you all remain resolute , that you go forward without limits , and that you use your talents -- because there are many ; we ' ve seen them ; it ' s there -- that you use them to create the world as it should be.
And it ' s full of challenges.
 " The human voice : mysterious , spontaneous , primal. "  With these words , soprano Claron McFadden invites us to explore the mysteries of breathing and singing , as she performs the challenging  " Aria, "  by John Cage.
Host : Folks , you ' ve just met Claron McFadden.
Please welcome Claron McFadden.
A child is born , takes its first breath -- and we behold the wondrous beauty of vocal expression -- mysterious , spontaneous and primal.
On my last day , the woman who looked after the place , she came and we spoke for a minute , and then she said to me ,  " Would you sing something for me ?  " 
So I closed my eyes , I took breath and the first thing that came up and out was  " Summertime, "  Porgy and Bess.
When you ' re totally in the moment , when I ' m totally in the moment , the vessel of expression is open.
It ' s called  " Aria. " 
But it ' s a kind of structure , and the singer within this structure has total freedom to be creative , spontaneous.
Using the body -- it could be sneezing , it could be coughing , it could be animals -- exactly -- clapping , whatever.
To me , this piece is an ode to the voice because it ' s mysterious -- as we can see -- it ' s quite spontaneous , and it ' s primal.
http://www.ted.com/talks/andreas_schleicher_use_data_to_build_better_schools.html
Andreas Schleicher : Use data to build better schools
Look at how the world looked in the 1960s , in terms of the proportion of people who had completed high school.
And the world didn ' t stop in the 1990s.
Two generations ago , Korea had the standard of living of Afghanistan today , and was one of the lowest education performers.
Look at the toxic mix of unemployed graduates on our streets , while employers say they cannot find the people with the skills they need.
We were less interested in whether students can simply reproduce what they have learned in school , but we wanted to test whether they can extrapolate from what they know and apply their knowledge in novel situations.
And once hotly contested , our way of measuring outcomes has actually quickly become the standard.
Yellow is so-so , and in green are the countries doing really well.
But I want to introduce a second important dimension into this picture.
Opportunities are unequally distributed.
Nobody , and no country , can afford to be there , where performance is poor and there are large social disparities.
In fact , one of the most important lessons from this comparison is that you don ' t have to compromise equity to achieve excellence.
But let ' s step back for a moment and focus on the countries that actually started PISA , and I ' m giving them a colored bubble now.
Spending per student only explains about , well , less than 20 percent of the performance variation among countries , and Luxembourg , for example , the most expensive system , doesn ' t do particularly well.
The red dot shows you spending per student relative to a country ' s wealth.
They invest in professional development and collaboration and many other things.
This is the blue bar which is driving costs down.
So they have invested all their money into there , and the blue bar , class size , is driving costs up.
So you can see two countries spent their money very differently , and actually how they spent their money matters a lot more than how much they invest in education.
The first thing you can see is that the bubbles were a lot smaller , no ? 
But there are some countries which have seen impressive improvements.
People were stunned by the results.
A lot was done to increase the life chances of students with an immigrant background or from social disadvantage.
Or traditionally , the German education divides children at the age of 10 , very young children , between those deemed to pursue careers of knowledge workers and those who would end up working for the knowledge workers , and that mainly along socioeconomic lines , and that paradigm is being challenged now too.
Or take Korea , at the other end of the spectrum.
A major overhaul of Poland ' s education helped to dramatically reduce between variability among schools , turn around many of the lowest-performing schools , and raise performance by over half a school year.
And even those people who complain and say that the relative standing of countries on something like PISA is just an artifact of culture , of economic factors , of social issues , of homogeneity of societies , and so on , these people must now concede that education improvement is possible.
And all that raises , of course , the question : What can we learn from those countries in the green quadrant who have achieved high levels of equity , high levels of performance , and raised outcomes ? 
Everybody says that.
How do the media talk about schools and teachers ? 
But placing a high value on education is just part of the picture.
But usually that is linked to very strong social disparities.
Nine out of 10 Japanese students say that it depends on my own investment , on my own effort , and that tells you a lot about the system that is around them.
High-performing systems also share clear and ambitious standards across the entire spectrum.
High-performing systems are very careful in how they recruit and select their teachers and how they train them.
In bureaucratic school systems , teachers are often left alone in classrooms with a lot of prescription on what they should be teaching.
Now the challenge is to enable user-generated wisdom.
The goal of the past was standardization and compliance.
And the most impressive outcomes of world-class systems is that they achieve high performance across the entire system.
And how do they do that ? 
They make them coherent over sustained periods of time , and they ensure that what they do is consistently implemented.
But its strength lies in telling them what everybody else has been doing.
But PISA has shown what ' s possible in education.
If we can help every child , every teacher , every school , every principal , every parent see what improvement is possible , that only the sky is the limit to education improvement , we have laid the foundations for better policies and better lives.

Now , it may seem like there is less hope today than there was before.
I know . How many people have hitchhiked within the past 10 years ? 
But I want to give you three examples to try to say that the trend line is in fact in the other direction , and it ' s the Internet helping it along.
You might have had a French club or a Debate club.
They had one great limitation and one great freedom as they tried to conceive of a global network.
But they had an amazing freedom , which was they didn ' t have to make any money from it.
That ethos led to a network architecture , a structure that was unlike other digital networks then or since.
That ' s why the mascot of Internet engineering , if it had one , is said to be the bumblebee.
It ' s very complicated , but it turns out they flap their wings very quickly.
Imagine , you being part of a network where , you ' re maybe at a sporting event , and you ' re sitting in rows like this , and somebody asks for a beer , and it gets handed at the aisle.
And , in a way , that ' s exactly how packets move around the Internet , sometimes in as many as 25 or 30 hops , with the intervening entities that are passing the data around having no particular contractual or legal obligation to the original sender or to the receiver.
It turns out there is no one overall map of the Internet.
And they can lather , rinse , repeat . And before you know it , you have a general sense of where everything is.
So , for example , last year , the government of Pakistan asked its Internet service providers there to prevent citizens of Pakistan from seeing YouTube.
It advertised -- the way that you might be asked , if you were part of the Internet , to declare what you see near you -- it advertised that near it , in fact , it had suddenly awakened to find that it was YouTube.
You see , that announcement went one click out , which got reverberated , one click out.
If you were sitting in Oxford , England , trying to get to YouTube , your packets were going to Pakistan and they weren ' t coming back.
How did this happen ? 
And here is the message where one of them says ,  " Looks like we ' ve got a live one . We have a hijacking of YouTube!
So it ' s kind of like if your house catches on fire.
You know , it ' s just like the hail goes out and people are ready to help.
Right . Dumbest idea ever.
The wiki was introduced so others could make suggestions on edits -- as almost an afterthought , a back room.
I have a theory I can explain later.
And there are a bunch of people who , on a sunny day , would rather be inside and monitoring this , the administrator ' s notice board , itself a wiki page that anyone can edit.
Apologies , Andyvphil , if you ' re here today.
It turns out there are more people checking this page for problems and wanting to solve them than there are problems arising on the page.
It ' s this thin geeky line that keeps it going.
It does make you wonder if there were , for instance , a massive , extremely popular Star Trek convention one weekend , who would be minding the store ? 
Some of you may remember Star Wars Kid , the poor teenager who filmed himself with a golf ball retriever , acting as if it were a light saber.
Now , it being encyclopedic and all , Wikipedia had to do an article about Star Wars Kid.
They eventually decided -- not unanimously by any means -- not to include his real name , despite the fact that nearly all media reports did.
If you do , it will be removed immediately , removed by people who may have disagreed with the original decision , but respect the outcome and work to make it stay because they believe in something bigger than their own opinion.
I mean , this is a 2005 Business Week cover.
This is my favorite goofy blog : Catsthatlooklikehitler.com.
So this is a blog devoted to unfortunate portraiture.
And it ' s one after the other.
The person said ,  " No , that ' s fine. " 
And then have technology that the person taking the photo will know later , this person requested to be contacted before this goes anywhere big , if you don ' t mind.
And it ' s no longer just a  " I don ' t know . I couldn ' t get there . I guess I ' ll move on, "  but suddenly a collective consciousness about what is blocked and censored where online.
Released it on the streets of Manhattan.
I ' m not so sure hitchhiking is dead.
Now why are people using it ? 
CouchSurfing : one guy ' s idea to , at last , put together people who are going somewhere far away and would like to sleep on a stranger ' s couch for free , with people who live far away , and would like someone they don ' t know to sleep on their couch for free.
And if you ' re wondering , no , there have been no known fatalities associated with CouchSurfing.
And when you go on it , if you listen and see carefully and closely enough , what you will discover is that that information is saying something to you.
Hans Rosling was a young guest student in India when he first realized that Asia had all the capacities to reclaim its place as the world ' s dominant economic force . At TEDIndia , he graphs global economic growth since 1858 and predicts the exact date that India and China will outstrip the US.
Once upon a time , at the age of 24 , I was a student at St . John ' s Medical College in Bangalore.
It was the brutal realization , the first morning , that the Indian students were better than me.
I used to be in the upper quarter of all courses I attended.
In Sweden we read it once and then we went partying.
It ' s that realization of someone you meet that really made you change your ideas about the world.
And I don ' t mean the whole economy , because to grow an economy of India to the size of U.K . -- that ' s a piece of cake , with one billion people.
I will start at 1858.
And I ' ve been able , through this wonderful Google and Internet , to find the text of the telegram sent back from President Buchanan to Queen Victoria.
Because 1858 was also watershed year in the history of Asia.
And that meant that foreigners , as it said in the treaty , were allowed to trade freely in China.
But , Japan , in contrast to India and China , maintained its national sovereignty.
On this axis , as I used to have income per person in comparable dollar.
And we will see , you know.
Actually if we go back into the historical record , there was a time hundreds of years ago when the income per person in India and China was even above that of Europe.
India was trying down here.
And it ' s the new century now . Health is getting better , United Kingdom , United States.
And now comes the Spanish flu also.
They have grown their population but not much more.
And we are moving into the new world.
And what happened ? 
Health services were provided.
But they went up here , and India was trying to follow.
And it was Deng Xiaoping coming out here.
And they decided to go not only for health and education , but also starting to grow their economy.
And here they march on . And will they catch up ? 
If I would split China , look here , Shanghai has already catched up.
And if I split Guizhou into urban and rural , the rural part of Guizhou goes down there.
Uttar Pradesh , the biggest of the states here , is poorer and has a lower health than the rest of India.
And that is not a bad thing , in itself.
Washington , D.C . went out here.
It ' s quite interesting , isn ' t it ? 
You can see that in health and education , a large part of the world population is putting forward , but in Africa , and other parts , as in rural Guizhou in China , there is still people with low health and very low economy.
When will it catch up ?  I have to go back to very conventional graph.
You see , China under foreign domination actually lowered their income and came down to the Indian level here.
Growth is starting , economic reform.
Can you see the bubble ? 
And it seems this is another rock coming down there , you know.
I can compare to Japan . This is Japan coming up.
Can you see here what Japan did ? 
It ' s always difficult to predict , especially about the future.
So , social investments in health , education and infrastructure , and electricity is really what is needed in India and China.
But what I ' m really worried about is war.
Now if these inequalities , climate and war can be avoided , get ready for a world in equity , because this is what seems to be happening.
And I expect to speak in the first session of the 39th TED India.

Before I tell that story , we should ask ourselves the question : Why does poverty exist ? 
Rich countries have been sending aid to poor countries for the last 60 years.
So the question is , why is that ? 
And they demanded authorities from -- to come down from their high horses.
Aid actually did the opposite.
And in fact , if you see oil-rich countries , where citizens are not yet empowered , the same thing goes -- Nigeria , Saudi Arabia , all sorts of countries.
And that is the real network effect.
And that is the perspective I have , and then I can start my story.
So 12 years ago , I was trying to be an investment banker in New York.
And it reminded me of a day in 1971.
And I walked 10 miles or so , all morning , to get there , to the medicine man.
So naturally , I -- the implication of that is that the telephone is a weapon against poverty.
The vast rural areas , where 100 million people lived , there were no telephones.
So if you lose that precious resource , where you are somewhat equal to the richer countries , that ' s a huge waste.
That you see , the horizontal axis is where you place your country.
The question was , how much did it cost to install a new telephone in Bangladesh ? 
And of course , if the cost of installing a telephone is going down , because there ' s a digital revolution going on , then it would be even more dramatic.
And Chris is a fisherman farmer . Both are generalists.
But in order to expand that , you need a river , or you need a highway , or you need telephone lines.
So the question was , I started looking at this issue , and going back and forth between Bangladesh and New York.
But the point is , if it ' s a production tool , why do we have to worry about that ? 
The car pays for itself.
In the United States , we have -- everybody needs a banking service , but very few of us are trying to buy a bank.
But again , it ' s very paternalistic.
For instance , the Internet was booming in the U.S.
But that ' s what ' s lacking in a poor country.
I thought I could put cell towers and create a network.
So I started focusing . What is it that they really do ? 
And this is a business for her , but it ' s milk for everybody else.
So I wrote to the bank , and they thought for a while , and they said ,  " It ' s a little crazy , but logical.
And angel investors in America put in money into that.
To make the story short , here is the coverage of the country.
Now , about that cow model I talked about.
And two dollars profit per entrepreneur per day , which is like 700 dollars per year.
And 2004 , the net profit , after taxes -- very serious taxes -- was 120 million dollars.
Actually , this is an instance where private companies can provide that.
 " Poor people are recipients. " 
 " The poor are uneducated and cannot do much. " 
 " Poor countries need aid. " 
He has produced some power generators , which we are now doing an experiment in Bangladesh , in two villages where cow manure is producing biogas , which is running these generators.
http://www.ted.com/talks/patricia_burchat_leads_a_search_for_dark_energy.html
Patricia Burchat sheds light on dark matter
Because , as I ' ll explain to you , the questions on the smallest and the largest scale are actually very connected.
By invisible , I mean it doesn ' t absorb in the electromagnetic spectrum.
We know it ' s there by its gravitational effects.
More about that later , OK.
So we have these stars going around in circles like this.
When those measurements are made , instead what we find is that the speed is basically constant , as a function of distance.
So we see the galaxy and fixate on that , but it ' s actually a cloud of dark matter that ' s dominating the structure and the dynamics of this galaxy.
They ' re the white , fuzzy , elliptical things here.
So all of these galaxies are moving.
But that cannot account for the mass either.
Can we see it more visually ?  Yes , we can.
How do we see that galaxy ? 
We say , the ray of light came this way ; the galaxy must be there , OK.
So this light ray will not continue in a straight line , but would rather bend and could end up going into our eye.
Is there any other ray of light that could make into the observer ' s eye from that galaxy ? 
Are there any other rays of light that could make it into the eye ? 
A circle , a ring . It ' s called an Einstein ring . Einstein predicted that , OK.
Because it turns out that there is a kind of lens that we can devise , that has the right shape to produce this kind of effect.
It ' s the base that I want you to concentrate , OK.
And so the next thing you need to do in your experiment is grab a napkin . I grabbed a piece of graph paper -- I ' m a physicist.
And you can put it on top of any image.
Do we see arcs in the sky when we look at , say , a cluster of galaxies ? 
Well , first of all , for the golden shape galaxies -- those are the galaxies in the cluster.
And it ' s an enormous amount of mass.
OK , so , a quick review then , to see that you ' re following.
OK . So now , let ' s turn to dark energy.
If you could do this , what you would find that with each passing day , each passing year , each passing billions of years , OK , the distance between galaxies is getting greater.
That ' s what the expansion of the universe or space means.
So the expansion slows down with time.
The startling answer to this question , OK , from these experiments , was that space is expanding at a faster rate today than it was a few billion years ago , OK.
No one was predicting ahead of time this is what ' s going to be found.
We call it dark energy , and it has this effect of causing space to expand.
There are really two mysteries out there as to what makes up most of the universe , and they have very different effects.
So by looking at things like clusters of galaxies , and how they -- their number density , how many there are as a function of time -- we can learn about how dark matter and dark energy compete against each other in structure forming.
Now , what do I mean by well motivated ? 
One or both , who knows ?  Or it could be something completely different.
So one way to look for them is to build detectors that are extremely sensitive to a dark matter particle coming through and bumping it.
They haven ' t seen anything , OK , but it puts limits on what the mass and the interaction strength of these dark matter particles are.
Now , because they are so non-interactive , they will actually escape the detector , so their signature will be missing energy , OK.
The big questions facing physics.
design,development,education,health,medicine,science,technology
I thought this was unacceptable . So I decided to do something about it.
And what was so sad about this particular story was that once their parents had found out -- and don ' t forget , their parents took them to the doctor -- the parents threw them out on the street.
And you can understand , obviously , the transmission problem between people in high-virus areas.
And you ' ll see , just now , a nurse coming back to the tray , which is their sort of modular station , and dropping the syringe she ' s just used back in the tray for it to be picked up and used again.
They are lucky . They already have a job.
In China , recycling is a major issue.
In all schools in Indonesia , there is usually a toy seller in the playground.
And they are having great fun.
So we need a better product . And we need better information.
You give the injection and then put it down.
And in comparison , a Coca-Cola is 10 times the price.
http://www.ted.com/talks/louie_schwartzberg_the_hidden_beauty_of_pollination.html
Louie Schwartzberg : The hidden beauty of pollination
And you can ' t tell the story about pollinators -- bees , bats , hummingbirds , butterflies -- without telling the story about the invention of flowers and how they co-evolved over 50 million years.
Beauty and seduction , I believe , is nature ' s tool for survival , because we will protect what we fall in love with.
We depend on pollinators for over a third of the fruits and vegetables we eat.
It reminds us that we are a part of nature and we need to take care of it.
And they ' d say ,  " Well , because they want to survive. " 
And I thought that they ' d probably say ,  " Well , it ' s all about sex. " 
Because I realized that nature had invented reproduction as a mechanism for life to move forward , as a life force that passes right through us and makes us a link in the evolution of life.
I hope you ' ll drink , tweet and plant some seeds to pollinate a friendly garden.
http://www.ted.com/talks/janine_benyus_biomimicry_in_action.html
Janine Benyus : Biomimicry in action
That ' s where I live , and it ' s my university as well.
This is what happens every year.
Imagine designing spring.
Imagine the timing , the coordination , all without top-down laws , or policies , or climate change protocols.
There ' s lots of grand openings.
And there was a wasp ' s nest that I had let grow in my yard , right outside my door.
He would come every day with something to show me.
And we looked at it together.
How did he not know -- it ' s what we ' ve all forgotten -- that we ' re not the first ones to build.
What ' s happening now , in this field called biomimicry , is that people are beginning to remember that organisms , other organisms , the rest of the natural world , are doing things very similar to what we need to do.
What I ' d like to do is show you a few of the things that they ' re learning.
They ' re the people who make the bullet train.
He went to the equivalent of an Audubon Society meeting.
And he thought ,  " What if we do this ?  " 
We ' re not the first ones to have to protect ourselves from some bacteria.
It actually basks . It ' s a slow-moving shark.
And that pattern , the architecture of that pattern on its skin denticles keep bacteria from being able to land and adhere.
It has no fresh water that it ' s able to drink , but it drinks water out of fog.
And the fog comes in and it builds up on the tips.
10 times better than our fog-catching nets.
There is now a cement manufacturing company starting in the United States called Calera.
None of these are using the organisms.
It ' s self-assembling.
There are many many ways that nature filters water that takes salt out of water.
And it ' s in every cell.
They export water molecules through , and leave solutes on the other side.
Actually G.M . Opel used it to create that skeleton you see , in what ' s called their bionic car.
It ' s waterproof.
One of our major inventions that we need to be able to do to come even close to what these organisms can do is to find a way to minimize the amount of material , the kind of material we use , and to add design to it.
Nanotechnology , nanoparticles , you hear a lot of worry about this.
In fact , sulfur-reducing bacteria , as part of their synthesis , they will emit , as a byproduct , nanoparticles into the water.
One of the largest consultants are the social insects.
There ' s a group of scientists in Cornell that are making what they call a synthetic tree , because they are saying ,  " There is no pump at the bottom of a tree. " 
Amazon electric eel -- incredibly endangered , some of these species -- create 600 volts of electricity with the chemicals that are in your body.
These are some questions that we ' ve yet to ask.
These wind turbines can rotate in incredibly slow windspeeds , as a result.
At Biomimicry Guild , which is my consulting company , we work with HOK Architects.
The question is -- biomimicry is an incredibly powerful way to innovate.
This is a depiction of all of the water on Earth in relation to the volume of the Earth -- all the ice , all the fresh water , all the sea water -- and all the atmosphere that we can breathe , in relation to the volume of the Earth.
Which is to create conditions conducive to life.
And what we ' re trying to do , in a TEDesque way , is to organize all biological information by design and engineering function.
And that information will go into AskNature.org.
And hopefully , with their help , we ' ll learn how to live on this Earth , and on this home that is ours , but not ours alone.

You probably know that roughly 25 million people in Africa are infected with the virus , that AIDS is a disease of poverty , and that if we can bring Africa out of poverty , we would decrease AIDS as well.
So today I ' m going to talk about some things that you might not know about the epidemic , and I ' m actually also going to challenge some of these things that you think that you do know.
But I ' m going to use tools and ideas that are familiar to economists to think about a problem that ' s more traditionally part of public health and epidemiology.
And probably for most people in this room , that ' s how you think about it.
And the first thing that I want to talk about , the first thing I think we need to understand is : how do people respond to the epidemic ? 
That is a huge effect.
Over a period from  ' 84 to  ' 88 , that share drops from about 85 percent to 55 percent.
People are learning more things about it.
So if you ' re a software engineer and you ' re trying to think about whether to add some new functionality to your program , it ' s important to think about how much it costs.
But your health decisions are the same.
People really like to have sex.
But we really need to test that.
It ' s a disease that kills a lot of adults in Africa , in addition to a lot of children.
This shows you -- in areas with low malaria , medium malaria , high malaria -- what happens to the number of sexual partners as you increase HIV prevalence.
Young women who live in areas with high maternal mortality change their behavior less in response to HIV than young women who live in areas with low maternal mortality.
But it also tells us something about policy.
Education campaigns , like the one that the president is focusing on in his funding , may not be enough , at least not alone.
So we ' re going to need to think about policy and what kind of policies might be effective.
We know they had this campaign . That ' s how we learn about what works.
So if I asked you ,  " Why don ' t you go and find me the prevalence in Burkina Faso in 1991 ?  " 
We have no way to figure out what happened over time.
But this leaves us with a big gap in our knowledge.
And I think that the answer is , we can look at mortality data , and we can use mortality data to figure out what the prevalence was in the past.
Botswana is a place with a lot of AIDS , Egypt is a place without a lot of AIDS.
But since there are very few other diseases that kill people , we can really attribute that mortality to HIV.
You can see , almost without exception , the UNAIDS estimates are much higher than the mortality-based estimates.
You can see that for the prevalence to be as high as UNAIDS says , we have to really see 60 deaths per 10,000 rather than 20 deaths per 10,000 in this age group.
It doesn ' t mean that AIDS isn ' t a problem . It ' s a gigantic problem.
When I started working on these projects , I was not thinking at all about economics , but eventually it kind of sucks you back in.
It ' s good for improving people ' s lives.
The epidemic was introduced to the US by actually one male steward on an airline flight , who got the disease in Africa and brought it back.
But that actually doesn ' t mean at all that if we gave people more exports , more trade , that that would increase prevalence.
So this has important implications both for forecasting and for policy.
But it also tells us something about one of these things that we think that we know.
It ' s been replicated in Kenya , and Tanzania , and South Africa and many other places.
There was a big decline in coffee prices.
Starting about 1987 they ' re both going down a lot.
We ' re spending so much money to try to replicate this campaign.
There are tons of other things that we should think about doing.
But more than anything , you know , I ' m an academic.
And what ' s really , really great about being here is I ' m sure that the questions that you guys have are very , very different than the questions that I think up myself.

It ' s an Indian story about an Indian woman and her journey.
They belonged to boys.
We were four girls and no boys.
As I ' ve said , when we ' re born , we don ' t choose our parents , and when we go to school , we don ' t choose our school.
I grew up like this , and so did my other three sisters.
One is a British , another is an American and the third is a Canadian.
You either go up , or you come down. " 
If they ' re bad , they ' re your creation . Learn from it.
You ' ve got to just respond to the situation.
Because all of my best school friends were getting dolled up to get married with a lot of dowry , and here I was with a tennis racket and going to school and doing all kinds of extracurricular activities.
I joined the Indian Police Service as a tough woman , a woman with indefatigable stamina , because I used to run for my tennis titles , etc.
Because normally it was always said , power to detect , and that ' s it , or power to punish.
I didn ' t want to make it different from the men , but it was different , because this was the way I was different.
This was the first time a prime minister of India was given a parking ticket.
That ' s the reason , as a woman , I joined the Indian Police Service.
Now I was known as  " here ' s a woman that ' s not going to listen. " 
They sent me to prison to lock me up , thinking ,  " Now there will be no cars and no VIPs to be given tickets to.
Obviously , it was.
The first day when I went in , I didn ' t know how to look at them.
And they didn ' t say anything.
This is a visual of education inside the prison.
It was one of the finest , largest volunteerism in any prison in the world.
Nine to eleven , every prisoner went into the education program -- the same den in which they thought they would put me behind the bar and things would be forgotten.
Teachers were prisoners . Teachers were volunteers.
Now if I ' d not done that , it would have been a hellhole.
Secondly , this concept.
And this is what transformed.
Let me show you the next slide.
Not by preaching , not by telling , not by reading , but by addressing your mind.
This is a concept which I introduced to listen to complaints , listen to grievances.
If you see somebody in the blue -- yeah , this guy -- he was a prisoner , and he was a teacher.
Secondly is about the anti-corruption movement in India.
Thank you . Thank you very much . Thank you.
Internet,collaboration,computers,language,technology
How many of you found it really , really annoying ? 
And the reason it is there is to make sure you , the entity filling out the form , are actually a human and not some sort of computer program that was written to submit the form millions and millions of times.
And since they ' re used so often , a lot of times the precise sequence of random characters that is shown to the user is not so fortunate.
Text :  " Help! I ' ve been waiting for over 20 minutes , and nothing happens. " 
Let me now tell you about a project that we did a few years later , which is sort of the next evolution of CAPTCHA.
So this project started from the following realization : It turns out that approximately 200 million CAPTCHAs are typed everyday by people around the world.
See here ' s the thing , each time you type a CAPTCHA , essentially you waste 10 seconds of your time.
But then I started thinking , is there any way we can use this effort for something that is good for humanity ? 
So can we get you to do useful work for those 10 seconds ? 
So let me explain how this works.
Basically the way this works is you start with an old book.
It gives you an image for every page of the book.
Now the problem is that OCR is not perfect.
So the next time you type a CAPTCHA , these words that you ' re typing are actually words that are coming from books that are being digitized that the computer could not recognize.
We don ' t tell you which one ' s which , and we say , please type both.
And basically , since we released it about three or four years ago , a lot of websites have started switching from the old CAPTCHA where people wasted their time to the new CAPTCHA where people are helping to digitize books.
Twitter and about 350,000 other sites are all using reCAPTCHA.
Now of course , since we ' re doing so many words per day , funny things can happen.
It ' s the word  " Christians "  ; there ' s nothing wrong with it.
Oops.
See here ' s the thing , since we ' re presenting two randomly chosen words , interesting things can happen.
Imagine you ' re using the Internet and you see a CAPTCHA that you think is somewhat peculiar , like this CAPTCHA.
That ' s how it works.
And some of them , like paleontological shvisle , they contain Snoop Dogg.
And it is numbers like these that motivate my research agenda.
But now with the Internet , I ' ve just shown you a project where we ' ve gotten 750 million people to help us digitize human knowledge.
This is something that we ' ve been semi-quietly working on for the last year and a half or so.
So this is the project . Here ' s how it started.
By the way , you did hear me correctly ; his last name is Hacker.
So right now the Web is partitioned into multiple languages.
So I would like to translate all of the Web , or at least most of the Web , into every major language.
Machine translation nowadays is starting to translate some sentences here and there.
Even when it doesn ' t make a mistake , since it makes so many mistakes , you don ' t know whether to trust it or not.
It was translated from Japanese into English.
So he ' s just explaining something.
And then comes the ending , which is my favorite part of the whole thing.
So now the next question you may have is , well why can ' t we just pay people to do this ? 
For example , translating a tiny , tiny fraction of the whole Web , Wikipedia , into one other language , Spanish.
So it would be very expensive.
So I don ' t even know if there exists 100 million people out there using the Web who are bilingual enough to help us translate.
Normally , you have to pay people to do this.
There ' s a way to kill two birds with one stone.
And it ' s not just because they ' re being forced to do so in school.
And so basically they ' re learning by doing.
And as you translate them , and as you see how other people translate them , you start learning the language.
First of all , people are really , really learning a language.
So people really do learn a language.
So people really do learn a language.
The top is the German.
Now of course , we play a trick here to make the translations as good as professional language translators.
Remember , this is 50 million dollars-worth of value.
Now the thing that I ' m most excited about with Duolingo is I think this provides a fair business model for language education.
So it ' s extremely unfair towards the poor.
Since people are creating value while they ' re learning , they don ' t have to pay their money , they pay with their time.
So here ' s the site.
So thank you.

According to this view , the reason we want a big house or a nice car or a good job isn ' t that these things are intrinsically valuable.
The paradox of happiness is that even though the objective conditions of our lives have improved dramatically , we haven ' t actually gotten any happier.
In fact , in the last few years , there ' s been an explosion in research on happiness . For example , we ' ve learned a lot about its demographics , how things like income and education , gender and marriage relate to it.
I think that ' s a question we haven ' t really answered yet , but I think something that has the potential to be an answer is that maybe happiness has an awful lot to do with the contents of our moment-to-moment experiences.
The idea is that , if we can watch how people ' s happiness goes up and down over the course of the day , minute to minute in some cases , and try to understand how what people are doing , who they ' re with , what they ' re thinking about , and all the other factors that describe our day , how those might relate to those changes in happiness , we might be able to discover some of the things that really have a big influence on happiness.
What I ' d like to do with the rest of my time with you today is talk a little bit about one of the areas that we ' ve been investigating , and that ' s mind-wandering.
This ability to focus our attention on something other than the present is really amazing . It allows us to learn and plan and reason in ways that no other species of animal can.
Maybe these people are right . Maybe mind-wandering is a bad thing.
Well , since I ' m a scientist , I ' d like to try to resolve this debate with some data , and in particular I ' d like to present some data to you from three questions that I ask with Track Your Happiness . Remember , this is from sort of moment-to-moment experience in people ' s real lives.
Any of those yes responses are what we called mind-wandering.
Now you might look at this result and say , okay , sure , on average people are less happy when they ' re mind-wandering , but surely when their minds are straying away from something that wasn ' t very enjoyable to begin with , at least then mind-wandering should be doing something good for us.
So how could this be happening ?  I think part of the reason , a big part of the reason , is that when our minds wander , we often think about unpleasant things , and they are enormously less happy when they do that , our worries , our anxieties , our regrets , and yet even when people are thinking about something neutral , they ' re still considerably less happy than when they ' re not mind-wandering at all.
It ' s possible that ' s the case , but it might also be the case that when people are unhappy , then they mind-wander.
As it turns out , there is a strong relationship between mind-wandering now and being unhappy a short time later , consistent with the idea that mind-wandering is causing people to be unhappy.
Well , how often do people ' s minds wander ? 
This shows the rate of mind-wandering across 22 activities ranging from a high of 65 percent — — when people are taking a shower , brushing their teeth , to 50 percent when they ' re working , to 40 percent when they ' re exercising , all the way down to this one short bar on the right that I think some of you are probably laughing at.
In my talk today , I ' ve told you a little bit about mind-wandering , a variable that I think turns out to be fairly important in the equation for happiness.
Jarreth Merz , a Swiss-Ghanaian filmmaker , came to Ghana in 2008 to film the national elections . What he saw there taught him new lessons about democracy -- and about himself.
I was born in Switzerland and raised in Ghana , West Africa.
But then by the end of the decade , the country had fallen back into political instability and mismanagement.
There was a beaten up black and white television flickering in the background , and a former head of state and general was being blindfolded and tied to the pole.
Now Europe came as a shock to me , and I think I started feeling the need to shed my skin in order to fit in.
So here I was in 2008 wondering where I was in my life.
And I was thinking , how many terrorists could I possibly play before turning into one myself ? 
And there , I started by searching for the footprints in my childhood.
And I was thinking , was Ghana searching for its identity like I was looking for my identity ? 
Now in 1957 , Ghana was the first sub-Saharan country to gain its independence.
So here I was , December 7th , 2008.
And he said ,  " I ' m sorry , I can ' t tell you. " 
The candidates were back on the road ; they were campaigning.
There were claims of intimidation at the polling stations , of ballot boxes being stolen.
The army started firing their guns . People were scrambling.
And not only that , I am documenting it -- documenting my own cultural shortcomings.
And I realized it had to come from the people.
So it could happen.
We in the West , we preach the values , the golden light of democracy , that we are the shining example of how it ' s done.
Now the second round of voting did not bring forth a clear winner either.
And guess what , it worked.
Now the uphill battle for Ghana and for Africa is not over , but I have proof that the other side of democracy exists , and that we must not take it for granted.
http://www.ted.com/talks/kary_mullis_on_what_scientists_do.html
Kary Mullis celebrates the experiment
And I moved down to La Jolla and learned how to surf.
They usually talk about the 17th century.
It was called -- it was called  " The Air Pump, "  or something like  " The Leviathan and The Air Pump. " 
And when I went to find out something , I used scientific methods . I wasn ' t real surprised , you know , when they first told me how -- how you were supposed to do science , because I ' d already been doing it for fun and whatever.
So I ' m going to talk a little bit about that , and what exactly is it that scientists are supposed to do.
And Charles II , the son , was finally put back on the throne of England.
Now , Boyle was a friend of Charles II.
I mean , the first -- I think one of the first experiments he did was he put a bird in there.
One thing , he put a bird in there , and he pumped all the air out , and the bird died . So he said , hmm ...
Ah , uh -- Aristotle said that nature abhors one.
I mean , whatever that is that kills the bird -- and I ' m calling it a vacuum.
And Boyle said , bullshit.
And he did all these cute little experiments.
It ' s two fans , one which he could turn from outside after he got the vacuum established , and he discovered that if he pulled all the air out of it , the one fan would no longer turn the other one , right ? 
Charles II was kind of saying , you know , you should keep that -- let ' s make a place where you can do this stuff where people don ' t get so -- you know , we don ' t want the -- we don ' t want to get the people mad at me again . And so -- because when they started talking about religion and science and stuff like that , that ' s when it had sort of gotten his father in trouble.
And anybody who wants to do science is -- this is about the time that Isaac Newton was starting to whip out a lot of really interesting things.
You didn ' t have to be a member then.
The actual nature of reality was not at issue.
And seeing what happens , it was OK to generalize , and say , I ' m sure that this will happen anytime we make one of these things.
It ' s not clear ; actually sparklers will , but they didn ' t know that.
I mean , reality is what you can see.
What ' s happening here , in the middle of the 17th century , was that what became my field -- science , experimental science -- was pulling itself away , and it was in a physical way , because we ' re going to do it in this room over here , but it was also what -- it was an amazing thing that happened.
And -- things -- we never looked back.
Remember , that ' s a short time.
But in that 350 years , the place has just undergone a lot of changes.
But -- all of us own stuff.
You know , the important people -- you can almost read about their lives , about all the really important people that made advances , you know.
It isn ' t true . I mean , there ' s a lot of people -- You know , I was one of those scientists that was -- got into trouble the other night at dinner because of the post-modernism thing.
I didn ' t take it personally , but -- I just -- I had -- I naively had thought , until this surfing experience started me into the 17th century , I ' d thought that ' s just the way people thought , and everybody did , and they recognized reality by what they could see or touch or feel or hear.
And , I mean , that was my sort of goal.
You know , that ' s what you call a lead.
That ' s why I thought , as long as I don ' t blow my eyes out ...
So , I went to the drug store and I tried to buy some potassium perchlorate and it wasn ' t unreasonable then for a kid to walk into a drug store and buy chemicals.
I ' m sure it ' s got to do with rockets or it wouldn ' t be in that manual.
And it -- they burned.
And then it melted into a little sort of syrupy liquid , brown.
So I started developing -- you know , George ' s dad had a lot of help . I just had my brother.
And then you slowly build up a theory of how this stuff works.
And we had not -- I mean , we weren ' t frightened by it.
I hadn ' t heard about the 10 ways that we should be afraid of the -- By the way , I could have thought , I ' d better not do this because they say not to , you know.
So , so I ' ve got something else that ' s not personal.
Because the results of it were so spectacular that if it worked it was going to change everybody ' s goddamn way of doing molecular biology.
You know , that ' s how you do science.
And no tricky shit behind the thing . I mean , it ' s all -- you ' ve got to be very honest with what you ' re doing if it really is going to work.
I have a fairly bad memory , and dishonesty would always get me in trouble , if I , like -- so I ' ve just sort of been naturally honest and naturally inquisitive , and that sort of leads to that kind of science.
You know -- and there is a lot -- There is a lot -- a lot has been going on since Isaac Newton and all that stuff happened.
They made bigger guns to shoot them down with.
And they got involved in it , and the scientific and industrial establishment was born , and out of that came a lot of scientists who were in there for the money , you know , because it was suddenly available.
But a lot of people got in it for the money and the power and the travel.
And the people I ' m talking about are people that like -- they say that they ' re a member of the committee called , say , the Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change.
But there ' s a good explanation for that.
So the temperature has been , sort of , inching up.
And so he came up with this theory , and he said , this will be cool , because it ' ll be a longer growing season in Sweden , you know , and the surfers liked it , the surfers thought , that ' s a cool idea , because it ' s pretty cold in the ocean sometimes , and -- but a lot of other people later on started thinking it would be bad , you know.
But in fact , it was just coming up -- it was the nighttime ; the daytime temperatures didn ' t go up.
 " Evidence for Large Decadal Variability in the Tropical Mean Radiative Energy Budget. " 
And in this paper , they show something much more striking , and that was that they did what they call a radiation -- and I ' m not going to go into the details of it , actually it ' s quite complicated , but it isn ' t as complicated as they might make you think it is by the words they use in those papers . If you really get down to it , they say , the sun puts out a certain amount of energy -- we know how much that is -- it falls on the earth , the earth gives back a certain amount.
Well , these guys measured all of those things.
So the planet should get warmer.
They ' re concerned , and you can tell they have very guarded conclusions in these papers , because they ' re talking about big laboratories that are funded by lots of money and by scared people.
if they -- if they -- if they actually -- if they actually said that , I ' m getting out.
It ' s not by a small one . They just -- they just misinterpreted the fact that the earth -- there ' s obviously some mechanisms going on that nobody knew about , because the heat ' s coming in and it isn ' t getting warmer.
And if you just listen to the guys who are hyping those issues , and making a lot of money out of it , you ' ll be misinformed , and you ' ll be worrying about the wrong things.
At the 2008 EG Conference , artist Miru Kim talks about her work . Kim explores industrial ruins underneath New York and then photographs herself in them , nude -- to bring these massive , dangerous , hidden spaces into sharp focus.
I was raised in Seoul , Korea , and moved to New York City in 1999 to attend college.
I wanted to dissect it and look into its unseen layers.
In New York City , rats are part of commuters '  daily lives.
I also started looking around in the city and trying to photograph them.
I ' ll follow the rats. " 
When I took photographs in these locations , I felt there was something missing in the pictures.
I wanted a simple way to represent a living body inhabiting these decaying , derelict spaces.
When I first went in , I was scared , because I heard dogs barking and I thought they were guard dogs.
When I got comfortable in the space , it also felt like a big playground.
It lasted about five years.
Instead of looking at reproductions of it at home , you ' re actually feeling the hand-laid bricks and shimmying up and down narrow cracks and getting wet and muddy and walking in a dark tunnel with a flashlight.
Walking in this tunnel is very peaceful.
This is the same tunnel.
I was basically intruding in his living space.
One thing that struck me , after this incident , was that a space like that holds so many deleted memories of the city.
This is underneath my alma mater , Columbia University.
Most of my photos are set in places that have been abandoned for decades , but this is an exception.
After exploring recently-abandoned buildings , I felt that everything could fall into ruins very fast : your home , your office , a shopping mall , a church -- any man-made structures around you.
This was taken under a homeless asylum built in 1885 to house 1,100 people.
There are more than 185 miles of tunnels , and only about a mile is open to the public as a museum.
It ' s very dangerous to get lost in there.
This was taken under the Montparnasse Cemetery where most of the ossuaries are located.
The tunnels are famous for having been used by the Resistance , which Victor Hugo wrote about in  " Les Miserables. " 
It was built in the early 1500s.
This was probably the toughest place to explore.
I ' ve become more interested in capturing movement and texture.
It was performed last September one time only in the Atlantic Avenue tunnel in Brooklyn , which is considered to be the oldest underground train tunnel in the world , built in 1844.
This was taken inside an archaeological tunnel in the main temple.
Before life existed on Earth , there was just matter , inorganic dead  " stuff. "  How improbable is it that life arose ?  And -- could it use a different type of chemistry ?  Using an elegant definition of life  , chemist Lee Cronin is exploring this question by attempting to create a fully inorganic cell using a  " Lego kit "  of inorganic molecules -- no carbon -- that can assemble , replicate and compete.
What I ' m going to try and do in the next 15 minutes or so is tell you about an idea of how we ' re going to make matter come alive.
There ' s been four billion years of organic , biological life.
And I ' m absolutely enthralled by biology.
But within that infrastructure , we have to remember that the driving force of biology is really coming from evolution.
Think about evolution in terms of offspring competing , and some winning.
So when I thought about it , then suddenly I realized that biology gave us the answer.
Biologists seem to think so.
This is a dead crystal , and I ' m going to do something to it , and it ' s going to become alive.
Of course , they ' re not alive.
You can see there ' s architecture growing , filling the void.
But there ' s a problem , because up until maybe a decade ago , we were told that life was impossible and that we were the most incredible miracle in the universe.
Is life that improbable ?  " 
Let ' s say that if the physics of fusion is encoded into the universe , maybe the physics of life is as well.
In fact , we have such amazing lifeforms that we can manipulate.
So think , this is a serious question.
But before we can make life , let ' s think for a second what life really is characterized by.
Synthetic biologists are manipulating it.
But what does a cell do ? 
Well , I like think of it as a flame in a bottle.
And Darwin himself mused in a letter to a colleague that he thought that life probably emerged in some warm little pond somewhere -- maybe not in Scotland , maybe in Africa , maybe somewhere else.
So when you think about the improbable nature of what I ' m going to tell you in the next few minutes , just remember , we came from stuff on planet Earth.
We then got to the last ancestor.
You can decode the genome , you can look back , you can link us all together by a mitochondrial DNA , but we can ' t get further than the last ancestor , the last visible cell that we could sequence or think back in history.
I ' m not a politician , I ' m a scientist.
And this one happens to be a good source of all 20 amino acids.
So in the 1950s , Miller-Urey did their fantastic chemical Frankenstein experiment , where they did the equivalent in the chemical world.
In my own laboratory , the way we ' re trying to create inorganic life is by using many different reaction formats.
But that ' s probably going to end in failure , so we need to be a bit more focused.
But I need a metabolism , I need some energy.
 " This is my car , and I ' m going to drive around and show off my car. " 
So what we ' re going to try and do is come up with an inorganic Lego kit of molecules.
Carbon is banned.
And you can see on the screen a cell being made.
Molecules are competing for stuff.
If we can somehow encourage these molecules to talk to each other and make the right shapes and compete , they will start to form cells that will replicate and compete.
If we could get evolution into the material world , then I propose we should have a general theory of evolution.
So that means we could then start to develop different platforms for exploring this evolution.
What we do is we evolve it in a box with a light on.
So this will reorganize the way we design things.
Evolution cannot be cut apart.
You ' re sitting on chairs.
And we ' re really becoming very close to understanding the key steps that makes dead stuff come alive.
So what does it mean about defining life ? 
Chris Anderson : Just a quick question on timeline.
We ' re proposing to do it in just a few hours , once we ' ve set up the right chemistry.
In your own mind , what do you believe the chances are that walking around on some other planet is non-carbon-based life , walking or oozing or something ? 
Don ' t go and look for carbon , go and look for evolvable stuff.
education,illusion,media,science,technology
I ' d like to begin with four questions.
And they ' re questions that I ' ve asked of science television producers , of audiences of science educators -- so that ' s science teachers -- and also of seven-year-olds , and I find that the seven-year-olds do marginally better than the other audiences , which is somewhat surprising.
And your next question is , can you light a little torch-bulb with a battery , a bulb and one piece of wire ? 
Would you be able to do that ? 
I ' m not quite sure how he died , actually.
A little seed weighs a lot and , basically , all this stuff , 99 percent of this stuff , came out of the air.
The mass of this comes out of the air.
Yes , you can , and I ' ll show you in a second how to do that.
And so , there ' s a whole lot of people saying ,  " I ' d be very surprised if you told me that this came out of the air.
And when we gave them a battery , and a piece of wire , and a bulb , and said ,  " Can you do it ?  "  They couldn ' t do it . Right ? 
That ' s what plants actually do for a living.
But if you haven ' t played with a battery and a bulb , if you ' ve only seen a circuit diagram , you might not be able to do that , and that ' s one of the problems.
I promise you that most of you will have got that.
And if you think the tilt is tilting us closer , no , it isn ' t.
If you believe , as most of you probably do , that it ' s hotter in summer than in winter because we ' re closer to the Sun , you must have drawn an ellipse.
So , here ' s Copernicus '  view of what the solar system looked like as a plan.
What would you do if you knew that people had this misconception , right , in their heads , of elliptical orbits caused by our experiences as children ? 
But , no , look what I found in the textbooks.
So , these mental models -- we look for evidence that reinforces our models.
And , if you look at the , kind of the way these things are constructed , there ' s a lot of mediation by glass , and it ' s very blue , and kind of professional -- in that way that , you know , Woody Allen comes up from under the sheets in that scene in  " Annie Hall, "  and said ,  " God , that ' s so professional. "  And that you don ' t -- there ' s no passion in it , and it ' s not hands on , right , and , you know , pun intended . Whereas good interpretation -- I ' ll use an example from nearby -- is San Francisco Exploratorium , where all the things that -- the demonstrations , and so on , are made out of everyday objects that children can understand , it ' s very hands-on , and they can engage with , and experiment with.
And the Exploratorium does that really , really well.
They come with their own ideas and their own theories , and unless you work with those , then you won ' t be able to shift them , right ?  And I probably haven ' t shifted your ideas of how the world and universe operates , either.
So we ' re not empty vessels ; the mental models that we have as children persist into adulthood.
And we collude . We design tests , or at least in Britain , so that people pass them . Right ? 
Your homework is -- you know , how does an aircraft ' s wing create lift ? 
And you ' ve all got an idea in your head of the answer.
Now -- oh , oh yeah , go on then , go on.
974
And the reason I really like these goals is that there are eight of them.
Take child mortality ; the aim here is to reduce child mortality by two-thirds , from 1990 to 2015.
And even mighty Brazil is going down with five percent per year , and Turkey with seven percent per year.
I ' ll prove them wrong on both points.
Here you see the data.
What is the origin of the data ? 
What we rely on is not an incomplete system.
Are they alive ? 
But they have good quality.
This was 1977 , 1988 , 1992 ,  ' 97 and 2002.
But watch out -- they continue the line beyond the last point out into nothing.
But in June , I got a mail in my inbox from Demographic Health Surveys , and it showed good news from Kenya.
Isn ' t it nice -- isn ' t it nice , yeah ? 
I ' m going into some details here , because [the] U.N . do it like this.
As a professor , I think I have the right to propose something differently.
Had I been in the Ministry of Health in Kenya , I may have joined these two points.
And the reason here for Africa is especially important , because  ' 90s was a bad decade , not only in Kenya , but across Africa.
And there was socio-economic problems , which are now being solved at a much better scale.
You know , these economists , they love money , they want more and more of it , they want it to grow.
If your economy grows with four percent , you ought to reduce child mortality four percent ; if it ' s used well and people are really involved and can get the use of the resources in the way they want it.
In the 90s , only 1.2 percent , only 1.2 percent.
Still here , child death per 1,000 on that axis.
I give you Congo , which was high , Ghana -- lower . And Kenya -- even lower.
Congo got into civil war , and they leveled off here.
You can see it doesn ' t make sense to make an average of this zero improvement and this very fast improvement.
And they are judged , each country , on how they are doing.
It ' s very strange . It ' s sort of embarrassing.
My ancestors moved to the United States.
But look , the rate of lowering in Sweden was not fast.
You have to realize that the investments we do in progress are long-term investments.
But you don ' t talk about it so much.
Egypt was up here in 1960 , higher than Congo.
And they got safer water , they eradicated malaria.
Kenya is now speeding up.
I ' m going to show you the relationship between child mortality on this axis here -- this axis here is child mortality -- and here I have the family size.
Each bubble is a country -- the color , you can see , a continent.
They had high , or very high , child mortality and family size , six to eight.
What I want you [to do] now is to see with your own eyes the relation between fall in child mortality and decrease in family size.
It got down there -- China comes into the Western box here.
Come on . We want everyone down there.
There is no such thing as a  " Western world "  and  " developing world. " 
It labels  " developing countries, "  -- I can read from the list here -- developing countries : Republic of Korea -- South Korea.
They have the lowest child mortality in the world , Singapore.
How the heck could they be [a] developing country ? 
And we have to realize that we are all going to into this , down to here.
It ' s very clear that this is what happens.
It ' s fully possible to get child mortality down in all of these countries and to get them down in the corner where we all would like to live together.
We will not be able to manage the environment and avoid the terrible climate crisis if we don ' t stabilize the world population.

R.A . Mashelkar : Breakthrough designs for ultra-low-cost products
Do we care about those four billion people whose income levels are less than two dollars a day , the so-called bottom of the pyramid ? 
You can get a Mercedes for a very high price , very high performance.
And if they do so , then , of course , the conditions improve , and they start riding on scooters.
Now , this is something that we see on Indian streets all the time.
They believe that things can be done.
Yes , I went barefoot until I was 12.
And it was [unclear] Tata Trust , which gave me six rupees per month , almost a dollar per month for six years.
They combine all that.
He said , oh , probably he is going to build a three-wheeler with stepney.
And incredible car.
Let me tell you a bit about it.
And he told them ,  " Question the unquestionable.
I still am told about this story of that single wiper design in which he participated.
The team leader was Girish Wagh , a 34 year-old boy in [unclear].
For example , that a two-cylinder gas engine was used in a car with a single balancer shaft.
100 vendors were co-located adjacent to the plant , and innovative business models for automobile dealerships were developed.
It was an open innovation , ideas from all over were welcome.
All the time , you have been given an envelope.
Half the number of parts are contained in Nano in comparison to a typical passenger car.
When the Model T was launched -- and this is , by the way , all the figures that are adjusted to 2007 dollar prices -- Model T was 19,700 by Ford.
This is why you started actually a new paradigm shift , where the same people who could not dream of sitting in a car , who were carrying their entire family in a scooter , started dreaming of being in a car.
He has bought his own Nano.
And that is where , ladies and gentlemen , this famous theme of getting more from less for more becomes important.
And I titled this more from less for more and more people as Gandhian engineering.
What is its price ?  20,000 dollars.
More importantly , they not only walk far to work , and not only do they cycle to work , but they cycle for work , as you can see here.
Four billion people , their incomes are less then two dollars a day.
And that is how Jaipur Foot was created in India.
And unique high-ankle design and human-like looks , [unclear] and functions.
.. . above the limb , yes , it would be difficult ...
So that ' s what it is all about.
I ' ve been talking about getting more from less for more.
You know , you have new diseases that require new drugs.
Time taken for moving a molecule to marketplace , after all the human and animal testing , was 10 years , now it is 15 years.
So actually we are getting less from more for less and less people.
The cost of treatment , 20,000 dollars.
For example , we don ' t want 20,000 dollars ; we don ' t have it.
Cost of development -- 300 million dollars.
You know something ?  This has been achieved in India.
And therefore , the standard process , where you develop a molecule , put it into mice , into men , are not yielding those results -- the billions of dollars that have been spent.
I launched a big program [unclear] CSIR about nine years ago.
This is really getting more from less for more and more people , because these are all affordable treatments now.
And he also said ,  " I would prize every invention of science made for the benefit for all. " 
It ' s not about low cost.
Is it possible ?  It has been made possible , by the way , for certain other different reasons.
You ' re not talking exclusive innovation.
And I would also add , it is not only getting more from less for more by more and more people , the whole world working for it.
They ' re not available in Indian villages.
And by whom ? 
That ' s the new world that we want to create.
I ' ve still one and a half to go.
The 21st century gift , which is very , very important for the whole world , whether it is global economic meltdown , whether it is climate change -- any problem that you talk about is gaining more from less for more and more -- not only the current generations , for the future generations.
LP : A quick question for you.
RAM : I ' ll tell you a story that drove me , that transformed my life.
And one of them was [unclear] who taught us physics.
And then he said ,  " This is the focal length. " 
That gave me a great message : focus and you can achieve.
What does that focal length do ? 
It makes them meet.
So I learned the lesson of convex lens leadership from that.
I ' m trying to build a global team , which will look at the global grand challenges that the world is facing.
Customers want to feel what they buy is authentic , but  " Mass Customization "  author Joseph Pine says selling authenticity is tough because , well , there ' s no such thing . He talks about a few experiences that may be artificial but make millions anyway.
I ' m going to talk about a very fundamental change that is going on in the very fabric of the modern economy.
Commodities were the basis of the agrarian economy that lasted for millennia.
Commoditized : where they ' re treated like a commodity , where people don ' t care who makes them.
So , we moved from an industrial economy to a service-based economy.
Time to go beyond the goods and the services , and use , in that same heuristic , what happens when you customize a service ? 
Now most places that I talk to , when I talk about experience , I talk about Disney -- the world ' s premier experience-stager.
Think about drinking wine , about a journey to the Clock of the Long Now.
Now , over the last several years I spent a lot of time in Europe , and particularly in the Netherlands , and whenever I talk about the experience economy there , I ' m always greeted at the end with one particular question , almost invariably.
You Americans.
So much has that happened that I ' ve developed a fairly praticed response , which is : I point out that first of all , you have to understand that there is no such thing as an inauthentic experience.
Now , there may be more or less natural or artificial stimuli for the experience , but even that is a matter of degree , not kind.
Right ?  All of those are man-made , artificiality brought into the woods by you , and by the very nature of being there.
There isn ' t a square meter of ground in the entire country that hasn ' t been reclaimed from the sea , or otherwise moved , modified and manicured to look as if it had always been there.
Becoming the basis of the economy.
Getting the commodities to market.
And now , with the experience economy , it ' s about rendering authenticity.
Because all businesses are man-made objects ; all business is involved with money ; all business is a matter of using machinery , and all those things make something inauthentic.
And that is , to no surprise , in Shakespeare , and in his play , Hamlet.
And those three verses are the core of authenticity.
All right ?  Anybody else like that , no ? 
And the other dimension is : are they what they say they are to others ? 
All right , now , there is value for fake.
You can think about those two -- you know , both of these better than being fake fake -- not quite as good as being real real.
It is what it says it is : It ' s Universal Studio ; it ' s in the city of Los Angeles ; you ' re going to walk a lot.
Is it -- you can see behind all of it , and see what is going on in the facades of it.
But it is -- oh , I ' m sorry , I didn ' t mean to -- -- sorry.
When you are there you are just immersed in this wonderful environment.
Knowing where your heritage is : what you have done in the past.
Disney , 10 or 15 years ago , right , the Disney -- the company that is probably best-known for family values out there , Disney bought the ABC network.
That ' s one of the reasons why they ' re having such trouble today , and why Roy Disney is out to get Michael Eisner.
That ' s when you ' re perceived as fake , as a phony company -- advertizing things that you ' re not.
Then you have that perception that you are phony.
That ' s why you have companies like Starbucks , right , that doesn ' t advertise at all.
Right ?  It ' s beans ; right ?  It ' s coffee beans.
Take that same good , and perform the service of actually brewing it for a customer , in a corner diner , in a bodega , a kiosk somewhere , you get 50 cents , maybe a buck per cup of coffee.
One , don ' t say you ' re authentic unless you really are authentic.
http://www.ted.com/talks/alexander_tsiaras_conception_to_birth_visualized.html
Alexander Tsiaras : Conception to birth -- visualized
I remember one of the first times we were looking at collagen.
In your eye , it becomes a grid formation , and therefore , it becomes transparent , as opposed to opaque.
And what we were going to do was scan a new project on the development of the fetus from conception to birth using these kinds of new technologies.
Video text :  " From Conception to Birth "  Oocyte Sperm Egg Inseminated 24 Hours : Baby ' s first division The fertilized ovum divides a few hours after fusion ...
If the fetus continues to grow at this speed for the entire nine months , it would be 1.5 tons at birth.
But as you can see , when you actually start working on this data , it ' s pretty spectacular.
The marvel of this information : How do we actually have this biological mechanism inside our body to actually see this information ? 
And like this magnificent origami , cells are developing at one million cells per second at four weeks , as it ' s just folding on itself.
Even though I am a mathematician , I look at this with marvel of how do these instruction sets not make these mistakes as they build what is us ? 
It ' s just a tiny sub-substructure , microscopic.
The complexity of building that within a single system is , again , beyond any comprehension or any existing mathematics today.
Every six months until they ' re six years old -- we ' re going to be doing actually to about 250 children -- watching exactly how the gyri and the sulci of the brains fold to see how this magnificent development actually turns into memories and the marvel that is us.

When I was a very young child , I was extremely introverted and very much to myself.
So , the whole activity of working with my hands and creating objects is very much connected with not only the idea realm , but also with very much the feeling realm.
I fell in love with the way things moved , so I started to explore motion by making little flipbooks.
So that was how I first started to explore the way things moved , and expressed it.
I was also very interested in perhaps going into surgery and becoming a surgeon , because it meant working with my hands in a very focused , intense way.
Now , this kind of machine is as close as I can get to painting.
I love to figure things out , but the end result of what I ' m doing is really completely ambiguous.
Since I ' m always liking to solve problems , I gave myself the problem of turning a crank in one direction , and solving all of the mechanical problems for getting this little man to walk back and forth.
And that ' s a little found object.
I imagine what can be said with them.
And I started to make him walk across the table , and I thought ,  " Oh , I can make a little machine that will do that. " 
That ' s about that big.
I had this image in my mind , when I saw my son ' s little chair , and I saw it explode up and out.
Now , the machine is -- in this case , it ' s a real approximation of that , because obviously you can ' t move physical matter infinitely with infinite speed and have it stop instantaneously.
There are 12 pairs of 50:1 reductions , so that means that the final speed of that gear on the end is so slow that it would take two trillion years to turn once.
I ' m always imagining myself in different situations.
So , this machine does nothing but just bathe itself in oil.
So , it ' s sort of related , but you can see it ' s much more overtly erotic.
From an engineering point of view , this is just a little four-bar linkage.
For me , the process is very important , because I ' m inventing machines , but I ' m also inventing tools to make machines , and the whole thing is all sort of wrapped up from the beginning.
And that was that tool.
I just like , throw it in.
And the idea , their premise was that we wanted to show pieces of sculpture on the street , and there ' d be no subjective decision about what was the best.
So I would never win the race because I ' m always stopping.
Because when I was a kid , I also played a lot of guitar.
And I think there ' s a point between simplicity and ambiguity which can allow a viewer to perhaps take something from it.
The object itself just means nothing.
So I ' ll just let this chair come down.

I have to talk about astronomy without showing you any single image of nebulae or galaxies , etc.
Spectroscopy can probably answer the question ,  " Is there anybody out there ?  " 
And she published 42 articles just dedicated to the subject.
I spent about eight months working on these profiles.
But you have it in planets and asteroids.
Because they thought that if you are having a telescope , you are an astronomer so what you are doing is actually looking in a telescope.
It ' s just incredible . Because nobody understood really.
The power of spectroscopy was actually realized by Pink Floyd already in 1973.
How we get spectra ? 
And if you place a cool gas in front of a hot source , you will see certain patterns which we call absorption lines.
And we can also study chemical composition and physical parameters of stars , galaxies , nebulae.
It ' s cool for me.
So for me 5,000 degrees is pretty cool.
For instance , you see the spectral line of the gold is the only spectral line in the spectrum of the Sun.
It ' s a heavy element produced in thermonuclear explosions of supernovae.
It can be an indication.
It was incredible . The only conclusion we could make from this is clear evidence that there was a supernova explosion in this system , which polluted the atmosphere of this star.
It ' s amazing that you can go so far simply studying the chemical composition of stars.
You ' ve heard about solar flares.
And we found that everything is normal.
And there are six or seven similar cases reported in the literature.
You have two channels -- the massive stars and low-mass stars -- producing and recycling matter and chemical elements in the universe.
Doppler Effect is something very important from fundamental physics.
And we need nine centimeters per second to detect an Earth-like planet.
It is an amazing tool called astroseismology where we can detect sound waves in the atmospheres of stars.
Coming back to the most important question ,  " Is there anybody out there ?  " 
And we know very well that geothermal energy is mostly produced by decay of uranium , thorium , and potassium.
It ' s too much energy on a planet.
It ' s very tough . It ' s very tough.
It ' s really difficult.
If you receive something interesting , well that ' s what SETI does actually , what SETI has been doing for many years.
It ' s amazing that we can detect vegetation from a spectrum.
You can actually go and detect and study a chemical composition of planets far , far , far from solar system.
So it ' s something which you can always refer to SETI and say ,  " Well , somebody must be doing this , somehow. " 
There can be different ways doing this.
And we are doing this job since 2000 and it ' s a very heavy project.
So the main question :  " Are we alone ?  " 
It is the spectrum of a planet like Earth , showing a presence of nitrogen dioxide , as a clear signal of life , and oxygen and ozone.
It will take about five years.
Brené Brown studies human connection -- our ability to empathize , belong , love . In a poignant , funny talk at TEDxHouston , she shares a deep insight from her research , one that sent her on a personal quest to know herself as well as to understand humanity . A talk to share.
So , I ' ll start with this : a couple years ago , an event planner called me because I was going to do a speaking event.
And I was like ,  " Okay. " 
And she said ,  " I ' m going to call you a storyteller. " 
And I thought , you know , I am a storyteller.
And maybe I ' m just a storyteller.
So I ' m a researcher-storyteller , and I ' m going to talk to you today -- we ' re talking about expanding perception -- and so I want to talk to you and tell some stories about a piece of my research that fundamentally expanded my perception and really actually changed the way that I live and love and work and parent.
I was like ,  " Really ?  "  and he was like ,  " Absolutely. " 
And I ' m like , knock discomfort upside the head and move it over and get all A ' s.
But I want to be able to make them not messy.
Because , by the time you ' re a social worker for 10 years , what you realize is that connection is why we ' re here.
So I thought , you know what , I ' m going to start with connection.
When you ask people about belonging , they ' ll tell you their most excruciating experiences of being excluded.
And it turned out to be shame.
No one wants to talk about it , and the less you talk about it the more you have it.
And so I thought , this is my chance to beat it back with my measuring stick.
You know this.
At one point , people were sending me journal pages and sending me their stories -- thousands of pieces of data in six years.
There was only one variable that separated the people who have a strong sense of love and belonging and the people who really struggle for it.
And to me , the hard part of the one thing that keeps us out of connection is our fear that we ' re not worthy of connection , was something that , personally and professionally , I felt like I needed to understand better.
So I had a manila folder , and I had a Sharpie , and I was like , what am I going to call this research ? 
In fact , I did it first in a four-day very intensive data analysis , where I went back , pulled these interviews , pulled the stories , pulled the incidents.
What they had in common was a sense of courage.
They had the compassion to be kind to themselves first and then to others , because , as it turns out , we can ' t practice compassion with other people if we can ' t treat ourselves kindly.
They didn ' t talk about vulnerability being comfortable , nor did they really talk about it being excruciating -- as I had heard it earlier in the shame interviewing.
They thought this was fundamental.
This led to a little breakdown -- -- which actually looked more like this.
And I had to put my data away and go find a therapist.
I was like ,  " What does that mean ?  " 
So I found a therapist.
She said ,  " What ' s going on ?  " 
And I said ,  " Well , I have a vulnerability issue.
 " I just need some strategies. " 
And she said ,  " It ' s neither good nor bad. " 
And it took about a year.
It was a slugfest.
Why do we struggle with it so much ? 
We numb vulnerability -- when we ' re waiting for the call.
Because I wanted to know what ' s out there.
And I think there ' s evidence -- and it ' s not the only reason this evidence exists , but I think it ' s a huge cause -- we are the most in-debt , obese , addicted and medicated adult cohort in U.S . history.
I don ' t want to feel these.
I hack into your lives for a living.
So when we numb those , we numb joy , we numb gratitude , we numb happiness.
And it doesn ' t just have to be addiction.
That ' s it.
There ' s no discourse anymore.
A way to discharge pain and discomfort.
Which just , I hope in 100 years , people will look back and go ,  " Wow. " 
And when you hold those perfect little babies in your hand , our job is not to say ,  " Look at her , she ' s perfect.
That ' s our job.
We do that corporate -- whether it ' s a bailout , an oil spill , a recall -- we pretend like what we ' re doing doesn ' t have a huge impact on other people.
But there ' s another way , and I ' ll leave you with this.
just to be able to stop and , instead of catastrophizing what might happen , to say ,  " I ' m just so grateful , because to feel this vulnerable means I ' m alive. "

Gary Wolf : The quantified self
My heart rate was 61 beats per minute -- my blood pressure , 127 over 74.
We know that numbers are useful for us when we advertise , manage , govern , search.
They were making detailed journals of their spending , their mood , their symptoms , their treatments.
It is , as you can see , very small and also very cheap.
This tracks your activity and also your sleep.
It ' s really just a pressure sensor like the kind that ' s in a doorbell.
The sensor is just a little strip of metal in that headband there.
Most of what you see there is an asthma inhaler , but the top is a very small GPS transceiver , which gives you the date and location of an asthma incident , giving you a new awareness of your vulnerability in relation to time and environmental factors.
Here ' s a biometric device : a pair of Apple Earbuds.
Some people will say it ' s for biometric security.
And the self isn ' t the only thing ; it ' s not even most things.
When Jamie Heywood ' s brother was diagnosed with ALS , he devoted his life to fighting the disease as well . The Heywood brothers built an ingenious website where people share and track data on their illnesses -- and they discovered that the collective data had enormous power to comfort , explain and predict.
When my brother called me in December of 1998 , he said ,  " The news does not look good. " 
And you go from being a healthy , robust 29-year-old male to someone that cannot breathe , cannot move , cannot speak.
We looked at this and we said ,  " We ' re going to do something with this in an incredibly positive way. " 
This is the story of my brother.
And those questions all have variables to them.
and go from this concept of walking , breathing , and then his hands , speak , and ultimately happiness and function.
But it ' s not a data point at that one moment in time.
And he could still hold his wife ' s hand , but he couldn ' t do buttons on his clothes , can ' t feed himself.
So , here ' s Steven alone , sharing this story in the world.
There are so many other people sharing their stories.
These are not simple , they are not internet scalable ; they require thought and processes to find the meaningful information about the disease.
Here is an M.S . patient.
You can see fibromyalgia , HIV , ALS , depression.
But you can aggregate this and you can discover things about treatments.
Anyone want to run a comparative effectiveness study on prayer against something ?  Let ' s look at prayer.
So , anyone want to see the 32 patients that pray for 60 minutes a day , and see if they ' re doing better , they probably are.
How they treat it , the drugs , the components of it , their side effects , all of it in a rich environment , and you can drill down and see the individuals.
So , you can see the duration.
And this is a new version of our platform we ' re launching right now.
You scroll down in this profile and you can see all of his prescription drugs , but more than that , in the new version , I can look at this interactively.
Detrol . In the side effects for his drug , integrated into that , the stem cell transplant that he had , the first in the world , shared openly for anyone who wants to see it.
So , you click down on the ALS tab there.
But I want more.
I want to solve a problem . I want an application.
You ' re trying to manage these , and this grid is available here , and we want to understand it.
This is about the patients.
It ' s actually the most used feature on the website.
This is a journal , PNAS -- I think it ' s the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science of the United States of America.
Now , we ' ll skip the critiques of the paper.
So , you know we said -- we looked at this , and what I love also is that people always accuse these Internet sites of promoting bad medicine and having people do things irresponsibly.
And they call the Internet irresponsible.
I want to know now . Can you help us ?  " 
And they said , you know ,  " Jamie , PLM , can you guys tell us whether this works or not ?  " 
So , I said ,  " Okay well we can ' t do that . Then we can do something harder. " 
Can we find out what ' s going to happen to you , so that you can maybe change it ?  " 
And then we say ,  " Well how do we line them all up ?  " 
And he took lithium , and he went down the line.
It ' s actually scary . It ' s beautiful.
But here is the answer of the mean of the patients that actually decided to take lithium.
And the ones in the middle are all of our patients from the start of lithium at time zero , going forward , and then going backward.
You ' re actually doing slightly worse -- not significantly , but slightly worse . You don ' t want to be a lithium patient this time.
Even the ones that believed they were getting better matched the controls exactly . Exactly.
So , remember I told you about my brother ' s stem cell transplant.
I mean , I didn ' t know what was going to happen to him.
We hired them , set them up , assisting at lab.
We have to go talk to him . Because I ' d like to know what happened.
It ' s the first version of the time machine.
And I found a woman that had -- we found her , she was odd because she had data after she died.
I wished it had been there when I ' d done it the first time , and I ' m really excited that it ' s here now , because the lab that I founded has some data on a drug that might work , and I ' d like to show it.
http://www.ted.com/talks/justin_hall_tipping_freeing_energy_from_the_grid.html
Justin Hall-Tipping : Freeing energy from the grid
I remember March the 15th , 2000.
That same word ,  " normal, "  had two different , almost opposite meanings.
Only 90 days after this , arguably the greatest discovery of the last century occurred.
Two nanometers is 20 atoms in thickness.
Six and a half years later , a hundred and eighty researchers , they have some amazing developments in the lab , and I will show you three of those today , such that we can stop burning up our planet and instead , we can generate all the energy we need right where we are , cleanly , safely , and cheaply.
In winter , exactly the opposite is happening.
But this chickenwire carbon , called a carbon nanotube , is a hundred thousand times smaller than the width of one of your hairs.
You think of carbon as black.
And once you ' ve changed its state , it stays there until you change its state again.
This lets you do it.
I ' m going to show to TEDsters , the first time , this operating.
And then I ' m going to turn the lights out.
Suddenly you ' ve converted energy into an electron on a plastic surface that you can stick on your window.
We want to talk about storing energy , and unfortunately the best thing we ' ve got going is something that was developed in France a hundred and fifty years ago , the lead acid battery.
We said ,  " Could you build this ?  " 
Being able to do that means that I can generate energy cleanly , efficiently and cheaply right where I am.
The grid of tomorrow is no grid , and energy , clean efficient energy , will one day be free.
19 trillion dollars is what we ' re going to have to spend.
But in a world where energy is freed and transmittable easily and cheaply , we can take any water wherever we are and turn it into whatever we need.
18 years ago , I saw a photograph in the paper.
By any standard this is wrong.
And whenever I go round to somebody who says ,  " You know what , you ' re working on something that ' s too difficult.
That ' s what I say in my mind . And I just say  " thank you, "  and I go on to the next one.
design,industrial design,technology
This is slave labor to my own project.
But there is another world.
But if we look at the human scale , there ' s massive problems that aren ' t being addressed by those nanoscale technologies.
In water pipes , we have fixed-capacity water pipes that have fixed flow rates , except for expensive pumps and valves.
And I don ' t mean automated machines.
So what do we need if we want to do this at the human scale ? 
And then you need smartly designed interactions.
And the idea is that you take the three-dimensional structure of a protein -- in this case it ' s the crambin protein -- you take the backbone -- so no cross-linking , no environmental interactions -- and you break that down into a series of components.
So we can study this as a physical , intuitive model.
They had different molecular structures inside and different colors that could be mixed and matched.
You shake it hard and it breaks apart.
Last year at TED Long Beach , we built an installation that builds installations.
So today for the first time , we ' re unveiling a new project , which is a collaboration with Stratasys , and it ' s called 4D printing.
We also worked with Autodesk on a software they ' re developing called Project Cyborg.
Here ' s the first demonstration.
So no human interaction.
So I ' ve started a lab at MIT , and it ' s called the Self-Assembly Lab.
These are scenarios where it ' s difficult to build , our current construction techniques don ' t work , it ' s too large , it ' s too dangerous , it ' s expensive , too many parts.
In infrastructure , we ' re working with a company out of Boston called Geosyntec.

Shawn Achor : The happy secret to better work
And on one side of the bunk bed , I had put out all of my G.I . Joe soldiers and weaponry.
Now I nervously peered over the side of the bed to see what had befallen my fallen sister and saw that she had landed painfully on her hands and knees on all fours on the ground.
And I saw my sister ' s face , this wail of pain and suffering and surprise threatening to erupt from her mouth and threatening to wake my parents from the long winter ' s nap for which they had settled.
Did you see how you landed ? 
Of course , this was an option that was open to her brain at no point in the past.
.. . with one broken leg.
The very first thing I want to do is start my talk with a graph.
The fact that there ' s one weird red dot that ' s up above the curve , there ' s one weirdo in the room -- I know who you are , I saw you earlier -- that ' s no problem.
So one of the very first things we teach people in economics and statistics and business and psychology courses is how , in a statistically valid way , do we eliminate the weirdos.
If I asked a question like ,  " How fast can a child learn how to read in a classroom ?  " 
We ' re hoping for both because our business model is , if you come into a therapy session with one problem , we want to make sure you leave knowing you have 10 , so you keep coming back over and over again.
Then instead of deleting those positive outliers , what I intentionally do is come into a population like this one and say , why ? 
The reason this graph is important to me is , when I turn on the news , it seems like the majority of the information is not positive , in fact it ' s negative.
I have a brother in-law named Bobo -- which is a whole other story.
But I had no idea how to console poor Bobo because he had just gotten over an entire week of menopause.
I didn ' t expect to get in , and my family had no money for college.
Even if you ' re in a classroom full of people smarter than you , you ' d be happy just to be in that classroom , which is what I felt.
Their brain was focused on the competition , the workload , the hassles , the stresses , the complaints.
And when they see this , they say ,  " Shawn , why do you waste your time studying happiness at Harvard ? 
90 percent of your long-term happiness is predicted not by the external world , but by the way your brain processes the world.
I talked to a boarding school up in New England , probably the most prestigious boarding school , and they said ,  " We already know that.
Wednesday night is eating disorders.
Which I ' m glad you liked , but they did not like that at all.
The absence of disease is not health.
And if I ' m more successful , then I ' ll be happier.
You got good grades , now you have to get better grades , you got into a good school and after you get into a better school , you got a good job , now you have to get a better job , you hit your sales target , we ' re going to change your sales target.
But the real problem is our brains work in the opposite order.
Your brain at positive is 31 percent more productive than your brain at negative , neutral or stressed.
If we can find a way of becoming positive in the present , then our brains work even more successfully as we ' re able to work harder , faster and more intelligently.
We ' ve found that there are ways that you can train your brain to be able to become more positive.
Journaling about one positive experience you ' ve had over the past 24 hours allows your brain to relive it.
We get people , when they open up their inbox , to write one positive email praising or thanking somebody in their social support network.
children,education,gaming,psychology,technology,violence
Their culture isn ' t working in schools , and I ' m going to share with you ways that we can think about overcoming that problem.
This is a different kind of boy and a different kind of girl.
How do we know that ? 
For every 100 girls in special education , there are 217 boys.
And if you are a boy , you ' re four times as likely to be diagnosed with ADHD -- Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.
Nothing about that prevents us from paying attention to the literacy needs of our boys between ages three and 13.
Even in their older years , what we find is that there ' s still a problem.
And so we ' re starting to see the establishment of men centers and men studies to think about how do we engage men in their experiences in the university.
Video games are a symptom.
The first is zero tolerance.
I mean , really.
But when we say that an Eagle Scout in a high school classroom who has a locked parked car in the parking lot and a penknife in it has to be suspended from school , I think we may have gone a little too far with zero tolerance.
Boy comes home from school , and he says ,  " I hate writing. " 
 " Poems . I have to write poems.
 " I want to write about video games . I want to write about leveling-up.
You tell a teacher that , and they ' ll ask you , in all seriousness ,  " Should we send this child to the psychologist ?  " 
So that ' s the first reason : zero tolerance policies and the way they ' re lived out.
That means that 93 percent of the teachers that our young men get in elementary classrooms are women.
And so they say , I guess this really isn ' t a place for boys.
So that may be a very direct way that we see it happen.
Are there men around that table ? 
We have a serious compression of the curriculum happening out there.
And if you ask Title 1 teachers , they ' ll tell you they ' ve got about four or five boys for every girl that ' s in their program , in the elementary grades.
This compressed curriculum is bad for all active kids.
And so this is a very serious problem . Where is it coming from ? 
We want to live in Lake Wobegon where every child is above average , but what this does to our children is really not healthy.
We need to put ourselves into boy culture.
Most of the educational games that are out there today are really flashcards.
We need to talk to teachers and parents and school board members and politicians.
We need to think about how to uncompress this curriculum if we can , trying to bring boys back into a space that is comfortable for them.
But it only treats a few kids , and so this isn ' t very scalable.
Most of the educational games do not.
They ' re talking about their little action figures and their little achievements or merit badges , or whatever it is that they get.
It ' s very uncomfortable to be on the receiving end of that kind of language.
Because , ultimately , if we don ' t , then we ' re going to have boys who leave elementary school saying ,  " Well I guess that was just a place for girls.
http://www.ted.com/talks/john_maeda_on_design.html
John Maeda on his journey in design
Who has a computer ?  Yeah.
This was how computing began.
I mean , this was great.
And , you see , this era coincided with my own childhood.
It was just life-changing , you know . And so , in my life , you know , I was in the tofu ; it was a family business.
But , anyway , that ' s where I grew up , in this little tofu factory in Seattle , and it was kind of like this : a small room where I kind of grew up . I ' m big there in that picture.
I can ' t tell you -- family business story : you ' d understand this -- my father was the most sincere man possible.
Because , you see , we ' d seen my father taking the big block of tofu and cutting it , like , knife in , zap , zap , zap . We thought , wow.
And I was really good at school.
The Apple -- Macintosh just came out ; I had a Mac in hand when I went to MIT.
And the problem when you ' re younger -- for all you students out there -- is , your head gets kind of big really easy.
It ' s a little slim volume ; I ' m not sure if you ' ve seen this.
I got my masters , and then went to art school after that.
Remember that moment ?  It felt so good , didn ' t it ? 
You know , he wrote in one of his books :  " A Yale student once said ,  ' I came here to learn how to design , not how to use a computer. '  Design schools take heed. " 
And so I began to sort of mess with the computer at the time.
It was very hard to make this , actually.
And this is in 1993.
Now , I was saying , Well , that ' s the whole point : it ' s moving.
I started studying this whole idea , of like , what is this computer ?  It ' s a strange medium.
And so in Japan , I began to experiment with people.
They ' re laughing because he said , draw from the middle-right to the middle , and he kind of messed up.
We thought , ah , this is when it ' s going to happen.
So , this happened in 1993.
They ' re picking up a giant floppy disk made of cardboard.
And it ' s a sort of a working computer . And when I built this computer , I had a moment of -- what is it called ?  -- the epiphany where I realized that the computer ' s just so fast.
On this computer , if you move the mouse , it takes half an hour for the mouse cursor to change.
It was three Sony  " H "  devices that responded to sound.
And Chanel . So , getting to do different projects.
I have no staff ; it ' s all kind of made by hand -- these sort of broken hands.
He ' s the guy that kind of discovered me , and kind of got me going in digital media.
And you ' d feel so much better , you know.
How do you take that time you have left and go after it ? 
So , if you can see here , you know , that program you ' re seeing in the corner , if you spread it out , it ' s all these things all at once.
The computer lives in so many dimensions.
Is this what we want , you know ? 
You get it ?  No ?  O.K.
It didn ' t make any sense.
I made this series of works.
Because of that , I became interested in blue tape , so in San Francisco , at C.C. , I had a whole exhibition on blue tape.
They ' re littler computers , so the one-chip computers , I began to program one-chip computers and make objects out of P.C . boards , LEDs.
This is a series of lamps I made . This is a Bento box lamp : it ' s sort of a plastic rice lamp ; it ' s very friendly.
I ' ve done shoes for Reebok as well , as a kind of a hobby for apparel.
No , they ' re all out there.
In this strange moment where , like , these things kind of appeared.
It ' s the forever-always-on museum.
I began to collect every instance of circle-triangle-square.
This is also out there , you know.
My alma mater , MIT , and I had this moment -- a kind of M . Night Shayamalan moment -- where I thought , Whoa! I have to do this.
I was , like , aha , wait a second.
Who ' s a RISD alum out there ? 
And I have no idea what RISD should be , actually , or what it wants to be , but one thing I have to tell you is that although I ' m a technologist , I don ' t like technology very much.
There ' s my perspective . Because in reality , the problem isn ' t how to make the world more technological.
So , thank you everyone.

And there are historic attempts that have had some level of technical success.
And the result is the Terrafugia Transition.
And it works.
Still , we very much wanted to see the aircraft that we ' d all helped build in the air , off the ground , like it was supposed to be.
The flight testing that followed that was as basic and low-risk as we could make it , but it still accomplished what we needed to to take the program to the next step and to gain the credibility that we needed within our eventual market , the general aviation community , and with the regulators that govern the use of design of aircraft , particularly in the States.
A sport pilot can be certificated in as little as 20 hours of flight time.
Fortunately , necessity remains the mother of invention , and a lot of the design work that we ' re the most proud of with the aircraft came out of solving the unique problems of operating it on the ground -- everything from a continuously-variable transmission and liquid-based cooling system that allows us to use an aircraft engine in stop-and-go traffic , to a custom-designed gearbox that powers either the propeller when you ' re flying or the wheels on the ground , to the automated wing-folding mechanism that we ' ll see in a moment , to crash safety features.
So we did need a little bit of support from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
You can see there the wings folded up just along the side of the plane.
That ' s real time.
And you ' re all thinking what your neighbors would think of seeing that.
Radio : What did you think of that ? 
He would go onto tell us that the Transition had been the easiest airplane to land that he ' d flown in his entire 30-year career as a test pilot.
Now since we started Terrafugia about 6 years ago , we ' ve had a lot of those baby steps.
The Transition will cost in line with other small airplanes.
There are thousands of local airstrips that don ' t see nearly as many aircraft operations a day as they could.
Now , bad weather comes in , just land , fold up the wings , drive home.
Door-to-door travel time is reduced , because now , instead of lugging bags , finding a parking space , taking off your shoes or pulling your airplane out of the hanger , you ' re now just spending that time getting to where you want to go.
It also continues to be a fabulous adventure.
Advertising adds value to a product by changing our perception , rather than the product itself . Rory Sutherland makes the daring assertion that a change in perceived value can be just as satisfying as what we consider “real” value -- and his conclusion has interesting consequences for how we look at life.
This is my first time at TED . Normally , as an advertising man , I actually speak at TED Evil , which is TED ' s secret sister that pays all the bills.
If you think about it , if you want to live in a world in the future where there are fewer material goods , you basically have two choices.
The question was given to a bunch of engineers , about 15 years ago ,  " How do we make the journey to Paris better ?  " 
Now what is the hedonic opportunity cost on spending six billion pounds on those railway tracks ? 
Now , here is another naive advertising man ' s question again.
They seem fantastic to me . They cost very little to develop.
Someone was actually suggesting that you can take this concept further , and actually produce placebo education.
But , actually , the point of placebo education is interesting.
And you get a far lower risk of famine , because you actually had two crops to fall back on , not one.
The Prussian peasantry said ,  " We can ' t even get the dogs to eat these damn things.
He tried the marketing solution , which is he declared the potato as a royal vegetable , and none but the royal family could consume it.
What he ' d effectively done is he ' d re-branded the potato.
Now , boring people would have just simply banned the veil.
I can ' t verify that fully , but it does not matter.
All value is perceived value.
But the first thing is that all value is subjective.
So , the bizarre thing , which is baffling to conventional , classically trained economists , is that a weird little smiley face has a better effect on changing your behavior than the threat of a £60 fine and three penalty points.
In Britain we tend to feel ,  " Whoa! Got another three! " 
And it was replaced with replica jewelry made of cast iron.
Because actually , never mind the actual intrinsic value of having gold jewelry . This actually had symbolic value , badge value.
If you think about it , Shakerism was a proto-environmental movement.
In terms of dress , denim is perhaps the perfect example of something which replaces material value with symbolic value.
Now , we basically have to change our views slightly.
And there is a reason for some suspicion and uncertainly about it.
You had a monopoly supplier . On the left , you have Rupert Murdoch , or the BBC.
Although it ' s called agriculture in the world of food.
This is mobile food . British are very good at that.
I only learned this the other day . The Earl of Sandwich didn ' t invent the sandwich.
Every country has a contextual alcoholic drink . In France it ' s Pernod.
But so much communication now is contextual that the capacity for actually nudging people , for giving them better information -- B.J . Fogg , at the University of Stanford , makes the point that actually the mobile phone is -- He ' s invented the phrase ,  " persuasive technologies. " 
If you had a large red button of this kind , on the wall of your home , and every time you pressed it , it saved 50 dollars for you , put 50 dollars into your pension , you would save a lot more.
If you did this , more people would save more.
Now , I ' ve got an example here from Canada.
It ' s Kraft ' s peculiar way of rewarding loyalty to the crown.
Voiceover : New Diamond Shreddies cereal.
But , naturally , you can ' t do this kind of thing without a little bit of market research.
Woman : Weren ' t they square ? 
But a six is very different from a nine.
Take a square one there , first.
There were conservative elements in Canada , unsurprisingly , who actually resented this intrusion.
But this is both hysterically funny -- but I think an important philosophical point , which is , going forward , we need more of this kind of value.
Which isn ' t a bad definition of what our job is , to help people appreciate what is unfamiliar , but also to gain a greater appreciation , and place a far higher value on those things which are already existing.
So they actually reduce the need for actually spending great money on display , and increase the kind of third-party enjoyment you can get from the smallest , simplest things in life . Which is magic.
http://www.ted.com/talks/susan_blackmore_on_memes_and_temes.html
Susan Blackmore on memes and  " temes " 
We ' re the ones who let the second replicator out of its box , and we can ' t push it back in.
So first of all , I ' d like to say something about memetics and the theory of memes , and secondly , how this might answer questions about who ' s out there , if indeed anyone is.
Isn ' t that a wonderful thought , that there could be such a thing as a best idea anybody ever had ? 
Well , I say yes , and if there is , I give the prize to Darwin.
It ' s all just the same thing happening.
And 100 pages later.
You see the idea ? 
And as Dan Dennett puts it , if you have those , then you must get evolution.
Audience : Chaos.
You try them all in order : Mmm... ? 
You don ' t need a designer , or a plan , or foresight , or anything else.
Now , what ' s this to do with memes ? 
He talked mostly about animals and plants , but also about languages evolving and becoming extinct.
It selfishly copies.
And he wanted to get away from everybody thinking all the time about genes , and so he said ,  " Is there another replicator out there on the planet ?  " 
Information that we copy from person to person , by imitation , by language , by talking , by telling stories , by wearing clothes , by doing things.
So , he took the Greek word  " mimeme, "  which means that which is imitated.
It ' s important to stick with that definition.
It ' s not an idea . It ' s not equivalent to anything else , really.
Well , you sir , you ' ve got those glasses hung around your neck in that particularly fetching way.
All right everyone , who ' s got some interesting memes for me ? 
That ' s something that ' s passed on from person to person.
But some of them will be copied because they ' re good , or true , or useful , or beautiful.
And I ' m glad to say , as I expected , I found it when I came here , and I ' m sure all of you found it , too.
Audience : Soap.
SB : Sink , toilet , yes , these are all memes , they ' re all memes , but they ' re sort of useful ones , and then there ' s this one.
But I took this photograph in a toilet at the back of a tent in the eco-camp in the jungle in Assam.
Some hotels exploit the opportunity to put even more memes with a little sticker.
So , think of it this way.
Now , why is this important ? 
Language must have been useful for the genes.
There are two replicators now on this planet.
While their brains were having an advantage from being able to copy -- lighting fires , keeping fires going , new techniques of hunting , these kinds of things -- inevitably they were also copying putting feathers in their hair , or wearing strange clothes , or painting their faces , or whatever.
As the memes evolve , as they inevitably must , they drive a bigger brain that is better at copying the memes that are doing the driving.
And so , from our perspective , we don ' t realize that that ' s how it began.
The memes took a gene machine and turned it into a meme machine.
I have always , until now , called them all memes , but I do honestly think now we need a new word for technological memes.
We put the storage of memes out there on a clay tablet , but in order to get true temes and true teme machines , you need to get the variation , the selection and the copying , all done outside of humans.
So actually , now the temes are forcing our brains to become more like teme machines.
So , we ' re at this cusp now of having a third replicator on our planet.
We ' ve been asking it here at TED already.
I think that ' s the wrong way to think about it.
So , I would suggest that we don ' t think intelligence , we think replicators.
Just start with the number of planets there are in our galaxy.
Because it ' s only the third replicator that ' s going to reach out -- sending information , sending probes , getting out there , and communicating with anywhere else.
You can pull through , we have pulled through , but it ' s dangerous.
Actually , life forms produce things that kill themselves.
Think of the big brain.
My cat gave birth to four kittens , purring all the time.
Do you know , sitting here , your brain is using about 20 percent of your body ' s energy output for two percent of your body weight ? 
But maybe it nearly did.
What happened to the others ? 
And this is even more dangerous -- well , it ' s dangerous again.
Don ' t think ,  " Oh , we created the Internet for our own benefit. " 
Now , are we going to pull through ? 
One that is obviously happening all around us now , is that the temes turn us into teme machines , with these implants , with the drugs , with us merging with the technology.
We make new ones , and so it ' s convenient to piggyback on us , because we ' re not yet at the stage on this planet where the other option is viable.
Because those teme machines , they wouldn ' t need -- they ' re not squishy , wet , oxygen-breathing , warmth-requiring creatures.
It ' s coming , but we ' re not there yet.
Maybe we will , maybe we won ' t.

It was 25 minutes of absolute terror that thousands of people across the U.S . felt.
This is the national palace -- the equivalent of the White House.
This is the Ministry of Economics and Finance.
This is the largest metropolitan-area disaster in decades , and it was not a natural disaster -- it was a disaster of engineering.
We inspected schools and private residencies.
Behind that door is the National Judicial Archives.
The failure points were the same : walls and slabs not tied properly into columns -- that ' s a roof slab hanging off the building -- cantilevered structures , or structures that were asymmetric , that shook violently and came down , poor building materials , not enough concrete , not enough compression in the blocks , rebar that was smooth , rebar that was exposed to the weather and had rusted away.
That is 500 times the power of the 7.0 that hit Port-au-Prince -- 500 times the power , yet only under a thousand casualties.
If you look at this building in Chile , it ' s ripped in half , but it ' s not a pile of rubble.
On his last job he was working with his boss , and they started pouring the columns wrong.
And they redid that building.
Now there are many groups doing this.
For the billions spent on reconstruction , you can train masons for dollars on every house that they end up building over their lifetime.
For all the disaster , there is an opportunity here to build better houses for the next generation , so that when the next earthquake hits , it is a disaster -- but not a tragedy.

I was burned very badly.
Do you rip it off quickly -- short duration but high intensity -- or do you take your Band-Aid off slowly -- you take a long time , but each second is not as painful -- which one of those is the right approach ? 
And I would try to reason with them and say ,  " Why don ' t we try something else ? 
This is not just in Hebrew , by the way.
And one of the most interesting lessons I learned was that there is an experimental method that if you have a question you can create a replica of this question in some abstract way , and you can try to examine this question , maybe learn something about the world.
And I would bring people to the lab and I would put their finger in it , and I would crunch it a little bit.
I kept on doing this for a while.
Here were wonderful people with good intentions and plenty of experience , and nevertheless they were getting things wrong predictably all the time.
All of these would have been great things to do , and my nurses had no idea.
And the reason I picked cheating is because it ' s interesting , but also it tells us something , I think , about the stock market situation we ' re in.
And here ' s how it went.
Other people I would tempt to cheat.
People now solved seven questions on average.
You say , what ' s the probability of being caught ? 
So , we try to test this.
We got a lot of people cheating by stealing by a little bit.
Some people shredded everything , went out of the room , and paid themselves from the bowl of money that had over 100 dollars.
And we thought maybe what is happening is that there are two forces.
We call this like a personal fudge factor.
First , we asked half the people to recall either 10 books they read in high school , or to recall The Ten Commandments , and then we tempted them with cheating.
In fact , even when we gave self-declared atheists the task of swearing on the Bible and we give them a chance to cheat , they don ' t cheat at all.
And this is particularly interesting , because MIT doesn ' t have an honor code.
And I came back to measure what we technically call the half-lifetime of Coke -- how long does it last in the refrigerators ? 
Now , this is not a good social science experiment , so to do it better I did the same experiment as I described to you before.
We did not pay them with dollars ; we paid them with something else.
These things feel very differently.
But this did not solve the big problem I had with Enron yet , because in Enron , there ' s also a social element.
So , we did another experiment.
When we give people the opportunity to cheat , they cheat.
And the experimenter said ,  " If you ' ve finished everything , go home.
And they clearly cheated in a very , very serious way.
It turns out it depends on what kind of sweatshirt they ' re wearing.
All of the subjects sitting in the experiment were Carnegie Mellon students.
So it wasn ' t so much about the probability of being caught again.
So , what have we learned from this about cheating ? 
When we get bigger distance from cheating , from the object of money , for example , people cheat more.
Would they not be able to see it this way ? 
Could it be that with those more distant things , it ' s not a token for one second , it ' s something that is many steps removed from money for a much longer time -- could it be that people will cheat even more ? 
We have many intuitions in our life , and the point is that many of these intuitions are wrong.
So I went back to talk to them and tell them what I found out about removing bandages.
But think about me as a nurse , taking , removing the bandages of somebody I liked , and had to do it repeatedly over a long period of time.
I felt my intuition was correct. " 
We have very strong intuitions about all kinds of things -- our own ability , how the economy works , how we should pay school teachers.
Natalie MacMaster and her musical partner Donnell Leahy play several tunes from the Cape Breton tradition -- a sprightly , soulful style of folk fiddling . It ' s an inspired collaboration that will have you clapping along.
Natalie MacMaster : I ' m going to just quickly start out with a little bit of music here.
Well , I ' m really excited to talk a bit about my own upbringing in music and family and all of that , but I ' m even more excited for you people to hear about Donnell ' s amazing family and maybe even a little bit about how we met , and all that sort of thing , but for those of you that may not be familiar with my upbringing , I ' m from Cape Breton Island , Nova Scotia , eastern Canada , which is a very , very musical island , and its origins come from Scotland with the music and all the traditions , the dancing , the language , which unfortunately is dying out in Cape Breton.
His name ' s Buddy MacMaster , and just a wonderful guy , and we have a great tradition at home called square dancing , and we had parties , great parties at our house and the neighbors '  houses , and you talk about kitchen cèilidhs.
Donnell Leahy : Thank you . I ' m kind of new to the TED experience and I ' m glad to be here , but I ' m just trying to put it all together , trying to figure all you people out , and I ' ve been here for a short while , and I ' m starting to understand a little bit better.
Mom and Dad raised beef cattle , and I ' m the oldest boy.
We had a television for a few years , but of course we wasted so much time and the work wasn ' t getting done , so out went the television.
We learned to play the instruments , but we kind of had to come from within or go from within , because we didn ' t watch television , we didn ' t listen to a lot of radio . We went to church and to school sometimes , and farmed and played music , so we were able , I think , at a very critical age to develop our own style , our own self , and my mother plays , my father plays , and the style that came from the Ottawa Valley in Ontario , we call it French-Canadian style but it originated in logging camps.
NM : You want to or no ? 
And I said ,  " I know you.
Then — Will I keep going ? 
It ' s actually a Scottish piece I ' ve chosen.
NM : Well , we ' re gonna play one together now.
So we ' re gonna play something together anyway.
NM : I ' m not tuned . Hold on.
NM : Okay . Sure.
NM : Well , um...
DL : We ' re going to play a tune and Natalie ' s going to accompany me on the piano.
It had gone through , like , five or six families , and it was just a big thing for us , and we found actually an old picture of somebody and their family years ago.
NM : Just tell them what— DL : She wants me to talk about— We have a band named Leahy.
We had a great opportunity.
NM : Is this what marriage is about ? 
NM : It worked . DL : It worked.

Jill Sobule sings to Al Gore
Shimon Schocken and Noam Nisan developed a curriculum for their students to build a computer , piece by piece . When they put the course online -- giving away the tools , simulators , chip specifications and other building blocks -- they were surprised that thousands jumped at the opportunity to learn , working independently as well as organizing their own classes in the first Massive Open Online Course  . A call to forget about grades and tap into the self-motivation to learn.
So , this is my grandfather , Salman Schocken , who was born into a poor and uneducated family with six children to feed , and when he was 14 years old , he was forced to drop out of school in order to help put bread on the table.
He was also the ultimate self-learner , and like everything else , he did it in grand style.
His department stores confiscated , he spent the rest of his life in a relentless pursuit of art and culture.
They too did not enjoy the privilege of college education.
And that ' s me , I was going to say holding my first abacus , but actually holding what my father would consider an ample substitute to an iPad.
So I ' d like to share with you a story about a self-study , self-empowering computer science course that I built , together with my brilliant colleague Noam Nisan.
So Noam and I had this insight that if we want our students to understand how computers work , and understand it in the marrow of their bones , then perhaps the best way to go about it is to have them build a complete , working , general-purpose , useful computer , hardware and software , from the ground up , from first principles.
And then , following this advice , we start with this lowly , humble NAND gate , and we walk our students through an elaborate sequence of projects in which they gradually build a chip set , a hardware platform , an assembler , a virtual machine , a basic operating system and a compiler for a simple , Java-like language that we call  " JACK. " 
Noam and I worked five years to facilitate this ascent and to create the tools and infrastructure that will enable students to build it in one semester.
So chip specifications , APIs , project descriptions , software tools , hardware simulators , CPU emulators , stacks of hundreds of slides , lectures -- we laid out everything on the Web and invited the world to come over , take whatever they need , and do whatever they want with it.
And NAND2Tetris became one of the first massive , open , online courses , although seven years ago we had no idea that what we were doing is called MOOCs.
The people who are attracted to these courses typically have a hacker mentality.
The Minecraft community went bananas over this project , and Ben became an instant media celebrity.
So here ' s what Dan said.
So Dan demonstrates the many self-learners who take this course off the Web , on their own traction , on their own initiative , and it ' s quite amazing because these people cannot care less about grades.
I ' m sick of it.
And yet we don ' t tolerate mistakes , and we worship grades.
So here ' s what we do . Basically , we developed numerous mobile apps , every one of them explaining a particular concept in math.
And this little exercise here gives you a first good insight of the notion of area.
Now this particular transformation did not change the area of the original figure , so a six-year-old who plays with this has just discovered a clever algorithm to compute the area of any given parallelogram.
So after some guided trial and error , the child will discover , with or without help , that he or she can duplicate the original figure and then take the result , transpose it , glue it to the original and then proceed [with] what we did before : cut , rearrange , paste — oops— paste and glue , and tile.
And all this is something that a very young child can pick up using such mobile apps.
The driving force behind this project is my colleague Shmulik London , and , you see , just like Salman did about 90 years ago , the trick is to surround yourself with brilliant people , because at the end , it ' s all about people.
And with that , what this graffiti says is ,  " High-tech schmigh-tech.

It really wasn ' t until I was invited to the homes of people that I started to understand the human toll of the epidemic.
He liked to sit on her lap because he said that it was painful for him to lie in his own bed.
This is Joyce who ' s -- in this picture -- 21.
Joyce ' s mother is now taking care of her daughter , like so many other Zimbabwean children who ' ve been orphaned by the epidemic.
Chris Anderson : Kirsten , will you just take one minute , just to tell your own story of how you got to Africa ? 
It was just frightening.

We ' ve known about fusion since 1920 , when Sir Arthur Stanley Eddington and the British Association for the Advancement of Science conjectured that that ' s why the sun shines.
And as a child you ' re always worried about resource.
The countries that make a lot of money out of energy have something underneath them.
And as we try to lift billions of people out of poverty in the Third World , in the developing world , we ' re using energy faster and faster.
Solar can do it , and we certainly have to develop solar.
They ' re going to put in six new nuclear power stations , and probably more after that.
But there is a catch . Of course there is always a catch in these cases.
And sorry about that , but this is what turns me on.
It ' s a medium-sized nucleus.
And you can get energy out this way.
And there is one reaction that ' s probably the easiest fusion reaction to do.
But when you get them close enough , something called the strong force starts to act and pulls them together.
So , that ' s that process there . Deuterium and tritium goes together makes helium 5.
And it ' s this reaction that we want to do.
The trickiness about the reaction is that tritium doesn ' t exist in nature.
But fortunately , if you can do this fusion reaction , you ' ve got a neutron , so you can make that happen.
And as you go across there you see a few tens of years of oil -- the blue line , by the way , is the lowest estimate of existing resources.
And then we get to uranium.
To go any further you would have to have breeder technology.
And we have 30 million years worth of fusion fuel in sea water.
And we get within about the same price as current electricity.
We hold it with a magnetic field.
And just down the road , this is JET.
And in 2013 we ' re going to fire it up again and break all those records.
This is the device we ' re building now.
More than half the world ' s population is involved in building this device in southern France , which is a nice place to put an experiment.
We have to get to this.
But at the moment , all we can imagine is sometime in the 2030s.
But we can ' t abandon it now ; we have to push forward , get fusion to happen.
At TEDGlobal U , Cameron Sinclair shows the unreported cost of real estate megaprojects gone bust : thousands of migrant construction laborers left stranded and penniless . To his fellow architects , he says there is only one ethical response.
A few years ago , my eyes were opened to the dark side of the construction industry.
Behind the headlines that lay behind these buildings is the fate of the often-indentured construction worker.
And when they arrive , they find themselves in labor camps with no water , no air conditioning , and their passports taken away.
And last summer , more than 10,000 workers protested for the non-payment of wages , for the poor quality of food , and inadequate housing.
There is no way back home.
So let ' s forget your environmental footprint.
But , quite frankly , on this issue , there is no other road.

Thandie Newton : Embracing otherness , embracing myself
We each have a self , but I don ' t think that we ' re born with one.
It ' s no longer valid or real.
But the self is a projection based on other people ' s projections.
The self that I attempted to take out into the world was rejected over and over again.
The self was not constant.
Even the idea of us as a family was challenging to most people.
I was an anomaly , and my self was rooting around for definition and trying to plug in.
It has an extremely important function.
My hair wasn ' t right.
I was a noticeable nobody.
And I was a really good dancer.
I can hardly find the words to describe the peace I felt when I was acting.
By 19 , I was a fully-fledged movie actor , but still searching for definition.
 " So biology , genetics ?  "  she said.
So in Africa , there ' s been more time to create genetic diversity. " 
But what was credible , what is biological and scientific fact , is that we all stem from Africa -- in fact , from a woman called Mitochondrial Eve who lived 160,000 years ago.
I had a degree from Cambridge ; I had a thriving career , but my self was a car crash , and I wound up with bulimia and on a therapist ' s couch.
We ' ve created entire value systems and a physical reality to support the worth of self.
But there is something that can give the self ultimate and infinite connection -- and that thing is oneness , our essence.
It happens when I dance , when I ' m acting.
And when I ' m acting a role , I inhabit another self , and I give it life for awhile , because when the self is suspended so is divisiveness and judgment.
I always wondered why I could feel others '  pain so deeply , why I could recognize the somebody in the nobody.
And when I realized and really understood that my self is a projection and that it has a function , a funny thing happened.
I ' ve become very familiar with its dysfunctional behavior.
And if you can do that , incredible things happen.
So here ' s a note to self : The cracks have started to show in our constructed world , and oceans will continue to surge through the cracks , and oil and blood , rivers of it.
Let ' s live with each other and take it a breath at a time.
It ' s more a reality than the ones our selves have created.

Thomas Heatherwick : Building the Seed Cathedral
And I was there looking at the larger scale of buildings and finding that the buildings that were around me and that were being designed and that were there in the publications I was seeing felt soulless and cold.
And since , in the last 20 years , I ' ve developed a studio in London.
This is a hospital building.
And this is a window display.
And just very quickly , something we ' ve been working on very recently is we were commissioned by the mayor of London to design a new bus that gave the passenger their freedom again.
And if the bus is going to stop and it ' s three yards away from the bus stop , you ' re just a prisoner.
The brief is that the bus should use 40 percent less energy.
And this is a project for a bridge.
But the bridges that we saw that opened and closed -- I ' m slightly squeamish -- but I once saw a photograph of a footballer who was diving for a ball.
And it ' s a very boring bridge , as you can see.
We actually had to halve its speed , because everyone was too scared when we first did it.
And we used to be quite proud of the way we generated power.
And instead , we had to learn -- we kind of forced them to teach us.
And what we found -- this area is one of the poorest parts of Britain.
It has a symbolic importance.
So it felt that what we could try to do is make a power park and actually bring the whole area in , and using the spare soil that ' s there on the site , we could make a power station that was silent as well.
It has a space where you could have a bar mitzvah at the top.
We won the competition , and it was painful to get there.
It ' s the world ' s biggest ever expo that had ever happened.
And so that became the governmental goal -- is , how do you stand out in this chaos , which is an expo of stimulus ? 
And the world ' s first public park of modern times was in Britain.
And the same with flowers.
But this phenomenal project ' s been happening.
Because the DNA of the dinosaur that was trapped in the amber gave us some kind of clue that these tiny things could be trapped and be made to seem precious , rather than looking like nuts.
By the way , we had half the budget of the other Western nations.
Song : ♫ We ' ve got the Mop Tops , the Play-Doh Mop Tops ♫ ♫ Just turn the chair and grow Play-Doh hair ♫ ♫ They ' re the Mop Tops ♫ Thomas Heatherwick : Okay , you get the idea.
And by night , artificial light in each one emanates and comes out to the outside.
And so the rest of the site was a public space.
And inside there ' s nothing ; there ' s no famous actor ' s voice ; there ' s no projections ; there ' s no televisions ; there ' s no color changing.
A key thing was how people would interact.
And there was a lot of terror.
Children : One , two , three , go.
And the project that we ' re building in Malaysia is apartment buildings for a property developer.
And the conventional thing with apartment buildings in this part of the world is you have your tower , and you squeeze a few trees around the edge , and you see cars parked.
And by linking these together , we could have 90 percent of the site as a rainforest , instead of only 10 percent of scrubby trees and bits of road around buildings.
But the key part is trying to give back an extraordinary piece of landscape , rather than engulf it.
TH : These are a few of the tests we did when we were building the structure.
Waterproofing the building was a bit crazy.
http://www.ted.com/talks/shimon_schocken_s_rides_of_hope.html
Shimon Schocken ' s rides of hope
When I reach the summit of a steep mountain in the middle of nowhere , I feel young , invincible , eternal.
Unfortunately , I cannot show their faces , neither can I disclose their true names , and that ' s because my fellow riders are juvenile inmates , offenders spending time in a correction facility about 20 minutes '  ride from here -- well , like everything in Israel.
So on one of these rides , I talked my way into the compound and went to see the warden.
They are supposed to be locked up.
And so two months later , we found ourselves  " at large "  -- myself , 10 juvenile inmates and a wonderful fellow named Russ , who became a very good friend of mine and my partner in this project.
So we had a lot of this going on.
Now , let me give you an example.
His backpack goes ballistic in some other direction.
And you have to realize that these incidents did not happen in convenient locations.
Well , that ' s a problem because one way or another , you have to get this guy moving because it ' s getting dark soon and dangerous.
That ' s what they had all their lives.
So I would say ,  " Alex , I know that it ' s terribly difficult.
And I would say ,  " Relax , Alex.
And who is this guy , Alex , to begin with ? 
And he spent the last 10 years of his life in two places only , the slums and the state prison , where he spent the last two years before he ended up sitting on this rock there.
I want to say a few words about vision.
It all of a sudden dawned on me , in this project , that the purpose of these rides should actually be to expose the kids to one thing only : love.
I used to think that reason and logic and relentless drive were the only ways to make things happen.
And one of these principles is focus.
You know , perspective is one of these critically important life-coping strategies that mountain biking can really teach you.
Or you can also look back in time and realize that you ' ve already conquered steeper mountains before.
It ' s very cold , and you ' re standing in one of these rainy days , and it ' s drizzling and cold and chilly , and you ' re standing in , let ' s say , Yokneam.
And you say ,  " Hey , Alex . Look at this parking lot where we started.
And so we talked about these special words that we teach them.
This was the first place where we got some water and supplies. " 
Now I remember , when he said it , I felt goosebumps on my body , because he said it overlooking the Moab Mountains here in the background.
We explore ruins of Palestinian villages , and we discuss how they became ruins.
I ride with these kids once a week , every Tuesday.
And I feel blessed and fortunate that every week , every Tuesday -- and actually every Friday also -- I can once again celebrate in the marrow of my bones the very essence of living in Israel on the edge.

The  " blank slate "  was an influential idea in the 20th century.
Oh , and anyone who has both a child and a house pet has surely noticed that the child , exposed to speech , will acquire a human language , whereas the house pet won ' t , presumably because of some innate different between them.
If you ' ve ever taken anthropology , you know that it ' s a -- kind of an occupational pleasure of anthropologists to show how exotic other cultures can be , and that there are places out there where , supposedly , everything is the opposite to the way it is here.
This is a recent study by the neurobiologist Paul Thompson and his colleagues in which they -- using MRI -- measured the distribution of gray matter -- that is , the outer layer of the cortex -- in a large sample of pairs of people.
This is what happens in people who share half of their DNA -- fraternal twins.
Now , these aren ' t just differences in anatomy , like the shape of your ear lobes , but they have consequences in thought and behavior that are well illustrated in this famous cartoon by Charles Addams :  " Separated at birth , the Mallifert twins meet accidentally. " 
My favorite example is a pair of twins , one of whom was brought up as a Catholic in a Nazi family in Germany , the other brought up in a Jewish family in Trinidad.
Well , there are a number of political reasons why people have found it congenial.
Whereas , if we ' re born with certain instincts , then perhaps some of them might condemn us to selfishness , prejudice and violence.
Rather , that all men are equal in terms of their rights , and that every person ought to be treated as an individual , and not prejudged by the statistics of particular groups that they may belong to.
So even if people did have impulses towards selfishness or greed , that ' s not the only thing in the skull , and there are other parts of the mind that can counteract them.
 " Don ' t expect to get any more awards , job offers or positions in scholarly societies. " 
I -- I like -- There was indeed reason to be nervous , and there were moments in which I did feel nervous , knowing the history of what has happened to people who ' ve taken controversial stands or discovered disquieting findings in the behavioral sciences.
It ' s not clear , by the way , since then , whether that is an accurate generalization , but the data at the time seemed to support that.
But what I wanted to talk about are two of these hot buttons that have aroused the strongest response in the 80-odd reviews that The Blank Slate has received.
So let me tell you what aroused such irate responses , and I ' ll let you decide if whether they -- the claims are really that outrageous.
Visual arts -- decoration of surfaces and bodies -- appears to be a human universal.
I ' ll give you a couple of representative quotes :  " We can assert with some confidence that our own period is one of decline , that the standards of culture are lower than they were 50 years ago , and that the evidences of this decline are visible in every department of human activity. " 
That ' s from Robert Brustein , the famous drama critic and director , in The New Republic about five years ago.
By any economic standard , the demand for art of all forms is skyrocketing , as you can tell from the price of opera tickets , by the number of books sold , by the number of books published , the number of musical titles released , the number of new albums and so on.
And the humanities and arts programs in the universities , which by many measures , indeed are in decline.
And I would like to suggest that it ' s not a coincidence that this supposed decline in the elite arts and criticism occurred in the same point in history in which there was a widespread denial of human nature.
The beauty and pleasure in art -- probably a human universal -- were -- began to be considered saccharine , or kitsch , or commercial.
And , as you can see , there -- something has changed in the way the elite arts appeal to the senses.
And here is an example of one of her analyses :  " The move from a structuralist account in which capital is understood to structure social relations in relatively homologous ways to a view of hegemony in which power relations are subject to repetition , convergence and rearticulation brought the question of temporality into the thinking of structure , and marked a shift from the form of Althusserian theory that takes structural totalities as theoretical objects ... " 
People are staying away from elite art and criticism.
But it certainly inspired an energetic reaction from many university professors.
I ' m supposed to do lots of physical activity with my kids so I can instill in them a physical fitness habit so they ' ll grow up to be healthy adults.
Well , here ' s some sobering facts about parenting.
Until the studies are redone with adoptive children , who provide an environment but not genes to their kids , we have no way of knowing whether these conclusions are valid.
You might think , well , then they ' d be even more similar , because not only would they share their genes , but they would also share their environment.
A complementary finding , from a completely different methodology , is that adopted siblings reared together -- the mirror image of identical twins reared apart , they share their parents , their home , their neighborhood , don ' t share their genes -- end up not similar at all.
I think that the sciences of human nature -- behavioral genetics , evolutionary psychology , neuroscience , cognitive science -- are going to , increasingly in the years to come , upset various dogmas , careers and deeply-held political belief systems.
And I think that the argument can ' t be put any more eloquently than that.

And the job in question was sheep rancher.
The job in question : herding sheep . Great.
So I called the Humane Society and I say ,  " Look , I ' m going to be castrating some lambs , Can you tell me the deal ?  " 
And I said ,  " Well , what exactly is the process ?  " 
 " Great -- got it. " 
So the next day I go out.
Melanie picks up the lamb -- two hands -- one hand on both legs on the right , likewise on the left.
I always watch the process done the first time before I try it.
And he kind of flicked it open in a way that caught the sun that was just coming over the Rockies , it was very -- it was , it was impressive.
Now you think you know what ' s coming , Michael -- you don ' t , OK ? 
So , I do something now I ' ve never ever done on a  " Dirty Jobs "  shoot , ever.
We don ' t fool around , we don ' t rehearse -- we shoot what we get!
We can ' t do this. " 
And I said ,  " Why would you do it this way ?  " 
Let ' s do something that doesn ' t make the lamb squeal and bleed -- we ' re on in five continents , dude.
Melanie picks up another lamb , puts it on the post , band goes on the tail , band goes on the scrotum.
And I ' m looking at the lamb and I say ,  " Albert , how long ? 
 " A week. " 
And I was reminded how utterly wrong I am , so much of the time.
I go in , tail comes off.
 " Push it further. " 
And I heard him , I heard all the words.
You know , Aristotle says a tragedy is that moment when the hero comes face to face with his true identity.
I went in and I took them.
OK , I ' m still in  " Poetics, "  in Aristotle , and I ' m thinking -- out of nowhere , two terms come crashing into my head that I haven ' t heard since my classics professor in college drilled them there.
Literally , the transition from ignorance to knowledge is anagnorisis.
The other word , peripeteia , that ' s the moment in the great tragedies , you know -- Euripides and Sophocles -- the moment where Oedipus has his moment , where he suddenly realizes that hot chick he ' s been sleeping with and having babies with is his mother . OK.
When you start to look for peripetia , you find it everywhere.
It ' s crushing when the audience sees it the right way.
And , as I stood there , looking at the happy lamb that I had just defiled -- but it looked OK.
And he says ,  " Hey Mike.
I can still see Hillary doing the shots of rye , dribbling down her chin , with the steel workers.
You know , that ' s in my head , testicles are on my chin , thoughts are bouncing around.
People with dirty jobs are happier than you think.
Roadkill picker-uppers whistle while they work . I swear to God -- I did it with them.
Follow your passion -- we ' ve been talking about it here for the last 36 hours.
I mean , that ' s all I heard growing up.
He ' s making a great living.
He didn ' t follow his passion.
Now , he ' s selling them to Walmart.
That stuff -- it ' s suddenly all been turned on its head.
Right ? 
And I ' ll never forget , up in the Bering Sea , I was on a crab boat with the  " Deadliest Catch "  guys -- which I also work on -- in the first season.
Unspeakably dangerous.
But in that moment , what he said next can ' t be repeated in the lower 48.
My responsibility is to get you home rich. " 
Anyhow , a whole lot of things.
It goes like this -- we ' ve declared war on work , as a society , all of us.
And we ' ve waged this war on at least four fronts , certainly in Hollywood.
That ' s what plumbers look like , right ? 
But , we ' ve waged this war on Madison Avenue.
I just know that that ' s a front in this war.
I would never suggest for a second that something bad has come out of the tech revolution.
Your iPhone without those people making the same interface , the same circuitry , the same board , over and over ? 
They look like the stuff we walk around with.
I got a lot wrong.
Barack wants to create two and a half million jobs.
Every single year : fewer electricians , fewer carpenters , fewer plumbers , fewer welders , fewer pipefitters , fewer steamfitters.
And I know the point of this conference is to celebrate things that are near and dear to us , but I also know that clean and dirty aren ' t opposites.
Is there a definitive line that divides crazy from sane ?  With a hair-raising delivery , Jon Ronson , author of <em>The Psychopath Test</em> , illuminates the gray areas between the two . <em></em>
This story starts : I was at a friend ' s house , and she had on her shelf a copy of the DSM manual , which is the manual of mental disorders.
And it lists currently 374 mental disorders.
I ' ve got parent-child relational problems , which I blame my parents for.
And I think it ' s actually quite rare to have both malingering and generalized anxiety disorder , because malingering tends to make me feel very anxious.
Which is how I ended up having lunch with the Scientologists.
And he said ,  " Yes , we can prove it to you. " 
And he said ,  " Tony ' s in Broadmoor. " 
And I said to Brian ,  " What did Tony do ?  " 
Do you want us to try and get you into Broadmoor to meet Tony ?  " 
And we got to Broadmoor.
And the only bold colors are the reds of the panic buttons.
And then Brian said ,  " Here ' s Tony. " 
And he had his arm outstretched like someone out of The Apprentice.
And he said ,  " Yep . Yep . Absolutely . I beat someone up when I was 17.
Nurses will bring you pizzas.
So I said to the psychiatrist ,  ' I get sexual pleasure from crashing cars into walls. '  "  And I said ,  " What else ?  " 
Anyway he faked madness too well , he said.
I ' m not mentally ill. " 
Tony said that it ' s a lot harder to convince people you ' re sane than it is to convince them you ' re crazy.
But how do you sit in a sane way ? 
Am I crossing my legs like a journalist ?  " 
They say it proves that I ' m aloof and grandiose. " 
I said ,  " What ' s the story ?  " 
And in fact , faking madness is exactly the kind of cunning and manipulative act of a psychopath.
Speaks to items one and two on the checklist -- glibness , superficial charm and grandiose sense of self-worth.
He was a psychopath.
So here ' s the statistics : One in a hundred regular people is a psychopath.
So I think there ' s a very good chance there ' s about 30 or 40 psychopaths in this room.
It ' s like a form of psychopathy that ' s come down to affect us all.
You want to go and interview yourself some corporate psychopaths. " 
So I changed tack.
Can I come and interview you about your special brain anomaly ?  " 
He was taking me through the garden.
 " You ' ve got more sharks and you ' ve got tigers. " 
He ' d close down 30 percent of the workforce.
So in his kitchen -- he was standing there with his wife , Judy , and his bodyguard Sean -- and I said ,  " You know how I said in my email that you might have a special brain anomaly that makes you special ?  " 
And I said ,  " A psychopath. " 
And I said ,  " Okay . Grandiose sense of self-worth. " 
He said ,  " That ' s leadership. " 
But I did notice something happening to me the day I was with Al Dunlap.
He ' s only ever been married twice.
Because I was desperate to shove him in a box marked psychopath.
We travel across the world with our notepads in our hands , and we wait for the gems.
And this is a country that over-diagnoses certain mental disorders hugely.
I said ,  " Well they say that you ' re a psychopath. " 
He said ,  " I ' ve got a tribunal coming up.
And after 14 years in Broadmoor , they let him go.
Everyone ' s a bit psychopathic. " 
But she ' s married , so I ' m going to have to get her split up from her husband. " 
He was living with a girl outside London.
And then he phoned me.
He ' s a gray area in a world that doesn ' t like gray areas.
And I didn ' t go . What would you have done ?

Democracy , as a type of politics , is a technology for the control and deployment of power.
Let me say parenthetically why I think that ' s the case , because I think it ' s a potentially controversial statement.
That ' s why we heard about the backing away from the Kyoto protocol , for example.
Now , the reason I begin by saying  " no 9/11 , no war "  is that we have to acknowledge that Islam , as interpreted by a very , very small , extremely radical group of people , was a precipitating cause of the 9/11 attacks -- the precipitating cause of the 9/11 attacks -- and as a consequence , at one degree of remove , the precipitating cause of the coming war that we ' re about to be engaged in.
It ' s meant to be a mechanism for construing the universe in a way that will bring about the salvation of the individual believer , but it ' s also meant by the Islamists -- and I use that term to mean people who believe that Islam -- they follow the slogan , Islam is the answer to a wide range of questions , whether they ' re social , or political , or personal , or spiritual.
Now , I don ' t want to leave a misimpression by identifying either of these propositions -- rather , either of these phenomena , democracy or Islam -- as technologies.
You can show a slogan , or a symbol , or a sign that stands for democracy.
That ' s because these are the kinds of concepts that are not susceptible to easy representation.
They ' re ideas about which people disagree in the deepest possible sense.
Other people would say it means something else.
And ostensibly , the same is true of democracy.
Now , if Islam and democracy are at present in a moment of great confrontation , what does that mean ? 
And I think that that ' s , in fact , probably the first appropriate response.
And they ' re manipulable in ways that can produce some extremely positive outcomes.
And they furthermore think overwhelmingly -- again one can ' t speak of every person , but overwhelmingly , and one can find this by reading any of the sources that they have produced , and they ' re all over the Internet and in all sorts of languages -- one can see that they ' re saying that their concern in their own countries is primarily to free up themselves to have choice in the spheres of personal life , in the sphere of economics , in the sphere of politics , and , yes , in the sphere of religion , which is itself closely regulated in most of the Muslim world.
It may be that there was a great war to be fought between West and East , and it was necessary on the axis of democracy against communism.
Now , you may say , but surely , what we ' ve seen on television about Saudi Islam convinces us that it can ' t possibly be compatible with what we consider the core of democracy -- namely , free political choice , basic liberty and basic equality.
And they ' re making this argument wherever they ' re permitted to make it.
They weren ' t even allowed to form a party.
So in Morocco , for example , they finished third in the political race but they were only allowed to contest half the seats.
Now what would that look like ? 
It will also not look exactly the way either the people in this room , or Muslims out in the rest of the world -- I don ' t mean to imply there aren ' t Muslims here , there probably are -- conceptualize Islam.
The war has tremendous risks for the model that I ' m describing because it ' s very possible that as a consequence of a war , many Muslims will conclude that the United States is not the kind of place that they want to emulate with respect to its forms of political government.
So the risks are very great.
You face the circumstances you have in front of you and you go forward.
And I think that we are capable of taking on that obligation , but only if we put what we can into it.
animals,birds,collaboration,global issues,ocean,oceans,science
And at this age , my personal idol was Flipper the dolphin.
When these heartbreaking images of oiled birds finally began to emerge from the Gulf of Mexico last year during the horrific BP oil spill , a German biologist by the name of Silvia Gaus was quoted as saying ,  " We should just euthanize all oiled birds because studies have shown that fewer than one percent of them survive after being released. " 
On June 23rd , 2000 , a ship named the Treasure sank off the coast of Cape Town , South Africa , spilling 1,300 tons of fuel , which polluted the habitats of nearly half the entire world population of African penguins.
Now when the Treasure sank in 2000 , it was the height of the best breeding season scientists had ever recorded for the African penguin -- which at the time , was listed as a threatened species.
I was a penguin aquarist at the New England Aquarium.
We have thousands of oiled penguins and thousands of willing , but completely inexperienced , volunteers.
In fact , many people compared it to a war zone.
Penguins are very vocal birds and really , really noisy.
Up to 1,000 people a day came to the rescue center , and eventually , over the course of this rescue , more than 12 and a half thousand volunteers came from all over the world to Cape Town to help save these birds.
Now mind you , three days earlier , we had 60 penguins under our care , so we were definitely overwhelmed and just a bit terrified -- at least I was.
So would it be humanly possible to save this many oiled penguins ? 
And what you should know about African penguins is that they have razor-sharp beaks.
And there really were no good solutions.
And luckily , the day they arrived , it was.
And the main thing learned during the Apollo Sea rescue in  ' 94 was that most of those penguins had died due to the unwitting use of poorly ventilated transport boxes and trucks -- because they just had not been prepared to deal with so many oiled penguins at once.
And we used this technique again during the Treasure rescue.
So all of those penguins had to have the oil meticulously cleaned from their bodies.
About a year prior to this oil spill , a 17 year-old student had invented a degreaser.
So he raced to the lab and made enough to clean the rest of the birds.
Should we routinely euthanize all oiled birds because most of them are going to die anyway ? 
And in addition , about 3,000 penguin chicks were rescued and hand-raised.
And this is critically important because , one year ago , the African penguin was declared endangered.
And I learned that one person can make a huge difference.
So I ' d like to leave you with one final thought and a challenge , if you will.
And the two main threats to penguins today are overfishing and global warming.

Pam Warhurst : How we can eat our landscapes
It used to look like this , and now it ' s more like this , with fruit and veg and herbs sprouting up all over the place.
The soil is extremely good.
And , you know , we ' re not doing it because we ' re bored.
And then , can we replicate those actions ? 
We did not consult . We did not write a report.
If we start one of those community plates spinning , that ' s really great , that really starts to empower people , but if we can then spin that community plate with the learning plate , and then spin it with the business plate , we ' ve got a real show there , we ' ve got some action theater.
We ' ve not asked anybody ' s permission to do this , we ' re just doing it.
I have never , ever experienced anything like that in my life.
And since we had that meeting three and a half years ago , it ' s been a heck of a roller coaster.
So we went to the doctors , said ,  " Would you mind us taking them up ?  " 
It ' s about taking those artistic people in your community and doing some fabulous designs in those raised beds to explain to people what ' s growing there , because there ' s so many people that don ' t really recognize a vegetable unless it ' s in a bit of plastic with a bit of an instruction packet on the top.
This is about us going to the people and saying ,  " We are all part of the local food jigsaw , we are all part of a solution. " 
And then there ' s the second plate , the learning plate.
It was really quite muddy , but in a truly incredible way , totally voluntary-led , we have turned that into a market garden training center , and that is polytunnels and raised beds and all the things you need to get the soil under your fingers and think maybe there ' s a job in this for me in the future.
And then there ' s the third plate , because if you walk through an edible landscape , and if you ' re learning new skills , and if you start to get interested in what ' s growing seasonally , you might just want to spend more of your own money in support of local producers , not just veg , but meat and cheese and beer and whatever else it might be.
We fundraised , we got some blackboards , we put  " Incredible Edible "  on the top , we gave it every market trader that was selling locally , and they scribbled on what they were selling in any one week.
So we launched a campaign -- because it just amuses me -- called Every Egg Matters.
We ' ve got increasing market stalls selling local food , and in a survey that local students did for us , 49 percent of all food traders in that town said that their bottom line had increased because of what we were actually doing.
But it is joined up , and it is inclusive.
Across age , across income , across culture.
People after the earthquake in New Zealand visited us in order to incorporate some of this public spiritedness around local growing into the heart of Christchurch.
First , they ' re going to create an asset register of spare land that they ' ve got , put it in a food bank so that communities can use that wherever they live , and they ' re going to underpin that with a license.
I mean , just to list a few . One , please stop putting prickly plants around public buildings . It ' s a waste of space.
This isn ' t a second class exercise.
Through an organic process , through an increasing recognition of the power of small actions , we are starting , at last , to believe in ourselves again , and to believe in our capacity , each and every one of us , to build a different and a kinder future , and in my book , that ' s incredible.

And I ' m also rather surprised , because when I look back on my life the last thing I ever wanted to do was write , or be in any way involved in religion.
And I certainly didn ' t even want to be a writer , particularly.
This went down very well in the U.K. , where religion is extremely unpopular.
And while I found I knew nothing about these faiths at all -- despite my own intensely religious background , I ' d seen Judaism only as a kind of prelude to Christianity , and I knew nothing about Islam at all.
These doctrines seemed unproven , abstract.
 " I believe: "  it did not mean ,  " I accept certain creedal articles of faith. " 
So if religion is not about believing things , what is it about ? 
And religious doctrines are meant to be summons to action ; you only understand them when you put them into practice.
Why ?  Because in compassion , when we feel with the other , we dethrone ourselves from the center of our world and we put another person there . And once we get rid of ego , then we ' re ready to see the Divine.
And it was -- the Golden Rule would bring them to the transcendent value that he called  " ren, "  human-heartedness , which was a transcendent experience in itself.
Hillel stood on one leg and said ,  " That which is hateful to you , do not do to your neighbor . That is the Torah . The rest is commentary.
The great Rabbi Meir said that any interpretation of Scripture which led to hatred and disdain , or contempt of other people -- any people whatsoever -- was illegitimate.
But now look at our world . And we are living in a world that is -- where religion has been hijacked . Where terrorists cite Quranic verses to justify their atrocities.
So the traditions also insisted -- and this is an important point , I think -- that you could not and must not confine your compassion to your own group : your own nation , your own co-religionists , your own fellow countrymen . You must have what one of the Chinese sages called  " jian ai "  : concern for everybody . Love your enemies . Honor the stranger.
The causes of our present woes are political.
And it ' s not surprising that religion , too , has been affected by this violent ethos.
Because the Golden Rule is difficult . I sometimes -- when I ' m speaking to congregations about compassion , I sometimes see a mutinous expression crossing some of their faces because a lot of religious people prefer to be right , rather than compassionate.
And especially the young people were coming . And were asking me -- the young people were saying ,  " What can we do ?  What can we do to change things ?  " 
And religion , with its wide following .. . Here in the United States , people may be being religious in a different way , as a report has just shown -- but they still want to be religious . It ' s only Western Europe that has retained its secularism , which is now beginning to look rather endearingly old-fashioned.
And these -- whatever our wretched beliefs -- is a religious matter , it ' s a spiritual matter.
And people in churches all over and mosques all over this continent after September the 11th , coming together locally to create networks of understanding.
This comes from  " The Iliad. "  But it tells you what this spirituality should be.
And everybody is shocked when the old man takes off his head covering and shows himself.
And then Achilles takes the body of Hector , he hands it very tenderly to the father , and the two men look at each other , and see each other as divine.
And it is often , perhaps , the very otherness of our enemies which can give us intimations of that utterly mysterious transcendence which is God.
I ' d like to see it -- to give guidelines as to how to interpret the Scriptures , these texts that are being abused . Remember what the rabbis and what Augustine said about how Scripture should be governed by the principle of charity.
Also , I would be working with the Alliance of Civilizations at the United Nations.
And so I do urge you to join me in making -- in this charter -- to building this charter , launching it and propagating it so that it becomes -- I ' d like to see it in every college , every church , every mosque , every synagogue in the world , so that people can look at their tradition , reclaim it , and make religion a source of peace in the world , which it can and should be . Thank you very much.

When Tony was 16 years old , one day , one moment ,  " It was mom ' s gun.
There ' s the punk on the ground , puddle of blood.
I know what is wrong . I have done wrong.
So I say to Tony ,  " Sorry , but it ' s worse than you think.
I want to know about wrongness itself , the idea of wrong.
Maybe one of us is wrong about the wrong.
And something changes for Tony.
What Tony sees in that moment is the project of philosophy , the project that begins in wonder -- what Kant called  " admiration and awe at the starry sky above and the moral law within. " 
Socrates , a man wise enough to know that he knows nothing.
Turns out , Tony ' s got the philosophy muscle.
So when he gives me his final paper , in which he argues that the categorical imperative is perhaps too uncompromising to deal with the conflict that affects our everyday and challenges me to tell him whether therefore we are condemned to moral failure , I say ,  " I don ' t know.
And I say to Tony ,  " Let ' s do this. "

I do a radio show.
We have made it quite clear to these people that an infinite monkey cage is roomy.
Yes , they gave 12 monkeys a typewriter for a week , and after a week , they only used it as a bathroom.
That ' s what I do.
Now astrology -- we remove the banal idea that your life could be predicted ; that you ' ll , perhaps today , meet a lucky man who ' s wearing a hat.
This is a wonderful thing.
That every person here , every decision that you ' ve made today , every decision you ' ve made in your life , you ' ve not really made that decision , but in fact , every single permutation of those decisions is made , each one going off into a new universe.
Remember that in the majority of universes , you don ' t even exist in the first place.
Science actually says we will live forever.
But every single thing that makes us , every atom in us , has already created a myriad of different things and will go on to create a myriad of new things.
Unlike the occupants of the universe , the universe itself is not wasteful.
Understanding , to me , does not remove the wonder and the joy.
And that is a wonderful thing there.
If someone punches me -- and because of my personality , this is recently a regular occurrence -- I understand where the pain comes from.
And that is all of these different things -- the love for my child.
You may well have your own children and think ,  " Oh no , my child ' s best. " 
But we don ' t notice that bit ; we just unconditionally love.
And all of these things to me give such joy and excitement and wonder.
Your partner is about to return.
I stopped observing the house for a moment , and when I started observing again , everything had happened. " 
If you actually think , you remove the myth and there is still something wonderful.
Even though I know the chair is made of atoms and therefore actually in many ways empty space , I find it comfortable.
That , to me , is an incredible thing.
But for me , it doesn ' t . That is a wonderful thing.
I can make my own purpose.
I have chosen to make silly jokes about quantum mechanics and the Copenhagen interpretation.
Playwright Eve Ensler explores our modern craving for security -- and why it makes us less secure . Listen for inspiring , heartbreaking stories of women making change.
I think it ' ll be a relief to some people and a disappointment to others that I ' m not going to talk about vaginas today.
Real security , security checks , security watch , security clearance.
In fact , I think that security is elusive . It ' s impossible.
This is , of course , unless your whole life is about being secure.
You can ' t open yourself to new experiences , new people , new ways of doing things -- they might take you off course.
You ' re a heterosexual or a homosexual , or you never have sex.
You cling to your land because it is your secure place.
But all this does , actually , is shut down your mind.
There are people not like you -- people who you now call enemies.
This becomes your mission . That is all you do.
It gets easier to hurt people because you do not feel what ' s inside them.
I ' ve spent time with women in Afghanistan under the Taliban , who were essentially brutalized and censored.
One of the amazing things that I ' ve discovered in my travels is that there is this emerging species.
They have grieved it , they have died into it , and allowed and encouraged poison to turn into medicine.
I venture there are many in this room.
I want to talk about a few of these people that I ' ve met.
Women in Uganda this year , who put on  " The Vagina Monologues "  during V-Day , actually evoked the wrath of the government.
The government finally made a decision that  " The Vagina Monologues "  could not be performed in Uganda.
There ' s a young woman named Carrie Rethlefsen in Minnesota.
They told her she couldn ' t love her vagina in high school , that it was not a legal thing , that it was not a moral thing , that it was not a good thing.
I met Agnes three years ago in the Rift Valley.
For eight years , she walked through the Rift Valley.
When V-Day met her , we asked her how we could support her and she said ,  " Well , if you got me a Jeep , I could get around a lot faster. "  So , we bought her a Jeep.
Three years ago , Agnes opened a safe house in Africa to stop mutilation.
Real security is contemplating death , not pretending it doesn ' t exist.
It cannot be bought or arranged or made with bombs.
I remember being on a plane going from Kenya to South Africa , and I had no idea where I was.
We come from somewhere and we are hopefully traveling all the time , moving towards a new place.
In the shared future , it will be just that , shared.
Eve Ensler : You know , I think Carl Jung once said that in order to survive the twentieth century , we have to live with two existing thoughts , opposite thoughts , at the same time.
Because when you spend a lot of time going from place to place , country to country , and city to city , the degree to which women , for example , are violated , and the epidemic of it , and the kind of ordinariness of it , is so devastating to one ' s soul that you have to take the time , or I have to take the time now , to process that.
Imagine that you ' ve been raped and you ' re bringing up a boy child.
creativity,design,humor,literature
I did that for two reasons.
It ' s the sensible shoe of public address.
And I ' m already off-message.
Tell your kids. " 
Now I was stupid , but not so stupid that I turned it down.
Because that is what Knopf is.
But they all have one thing in common : They all need to look like something.
Now , the first day of my graphic design training at Penn State University , the teacher , Lanny Sommese , came into the room and he drew a picture of an apple on the blackboard , and wrote the word  " Apple "  underneath , and he said ,  " OK . Lesson one . Listen up. " 
And they deserve better.
The Dietrich book was an observation by her daughter ; it was a biography.
No fighting , ladies.
Genius!
Now I took this diagram , and I put it in a Photostat machine , and I took a piece of tracing paper , and I taped it over the Photostat with a piece of Scotch tape -- stop me if I ' m going too fast -- and then I took a Rapidograph pen -- explain it to the youngsters -- and I just started to reconstitute the dinosaur.
And then I just threw some typography on it.
 " Michael Crichton responds by fax: "   " Wow! Fucking Fantastic Jacket "  That was a relief to see that pour out of the machine.
And I was thrilled.
But whoever it is , I can ' t help but thinking they woke up one day like ,  " Oh my God , that wasn ' t there last night . Ooooohh!
And it ' s a responsibility that I don ' t take lightly.
And the reason he went is because he had a fear of his body image , and he wanted to explore what was underlying that.
And David especially loved this design because at book signings , which he does a lot of , he could take a magic marker and do this.
He did not think so , however , but his coworkers did an intervention and they said ,  " You are going to rehab , or you will be fired and you will die. " 
This is going to be the opposite of that.
Then when we went to press , the printer put a spot gloss on the ink and it really looked like it was running.
Now , that ' s a good printing job.
All of these solutions derive their origins from the text of the book , but once the book designer has read the text , then he has to be an interpreter and a translator.
All right , so I got a collection of the paintings together and I looked at them and I deconstructed them and I put them back together.
Ahh! We come upon them , the clandestine lovers . Let ' s draw them out.
And now , we have to open it up to find out what ' s going to happen next.
Much is to be gained by eBooks : ease , convenience , portability.
Then he ' d run his hand over the rag paper , and the pungent ink and the deckled edges of the pages.
And the last story I ' m going to talk about is quite a story.
We go back to Hepburn and Dietrich , but now we merge them.
When it ' s on top of the paper board , which is the opposite , it forms this.
This is unheard of , both for us the publisher , and the author.
So even though we love publishing as an art , we very much know it ' s a business too , and that if we do our jobs right and get a little lucky , that great art can be great business.

Adora Svitak : What adults can learn from kids
Which really bothers me.
Well , Anne Frank touched millions with her powerful account of the Holocaust , Ruby Bridges helped to end segregation in the United States , and , most recently , Charlie Simpson helped to raise 120,000 pounds for Haiti on his little bike.
Maybe you ' ve had grand plans before but stopped yourself , thinking ,  " That ' s impossible, "  or ,  " That costs too much, "  or ,  " That won ' t benefit me. " 
How many of you still dream like that and believe in the possibilities ? 
In many ways , our audacity to imagine helps push the boundaries of possibility.
Now , when you think of glass , you might think of colorful Chihuly designs or maybe Italian vases , but kids challenge glass artists to go beyond that into the realm of broken-hearted snakes and bacon boys , who you can see has meat vision.
Now , I do most of my speaking in front of an education crowd , teachers and students , and I like this analogy : It shouldn ' t just be a teacher at the head of the classroom telling students ,  " Do this , do that. " 
Now , if you don ' t trust someone , you place restrictions on them , right ? 
As history points out , regimes become oppressive when they ' re fearful about keeping control.
My own parents had anything but low expectations for me and my sister.
Thank you Bill Gates and thank you Ma.
I don ' t know , you ' re kind of alienating a large client there.
But there ' s a problem with this rosy picture of kids being so much better than adults.
But the way progress happens is because new generations and new eras grow and develop and become better than the previous ones.
You must lend an ear today , because we are the leaders of tomorrow , which means we ' re going to be taking care of you when you ' re old and senile . No , just kidding.
Kids need opportunities to lead and succeed.
Game designer David Perry says tomorrow ' s videogames will be more than mere fun to the next generation of gamers . They ' ll be lush , complex , emotional experiences -- more involving and meaningful to some than real life . With an excerpt from Michael Highland ' s film  " As Real as Your Life. " 
I grew up in Northern Ireland , right up in the very , very north end of it there , where it ' s absolutely freezing cold.
My mother wanted me to be a dentist.
The school I went to was pretty boring.
And I was actually rowing for my school here until this fateful day , and I flipped over right in front of the entire school.
And so students like myself with nothing to do , we would learn how to program it.
So I brought a picture with big hair.
There ' s a picture of a guy doing homework with his son.
This is the guy that invented it , Sir Clive Sinclair , and he ' s showing his machine.
You had to have an even better imagination to play this game ,  " Death Rider. " 
It was around this time we went from 1K to 16K , which was quite the leap.
I spent ages flying this flight simulator , and I honestly believed I could fly airplanes by the end of it.
So I went on for the next 20 years or so making a lot of different games.
That was much better.
It grows every year.
43 percent of gamers are female.
Well , no , actually it ' s 30 years old.
Of course the newspapers love to beat on this.
It makes about 80 million bucks a month in subscriptions.
You have to remember that this is not a real island.
This market is now estimated at over 800 million dollars annually.
I liked this one the best : a level 60 Warlock with lots of epics for 174,000 dollars.
That ' s what the show looks like.
What do you think these people are doing ? 
Now , Chris told me that you had a timeline video a few years ago here just to show how video game graphics have been improving.
And I ' m going to show you up to maybe 2007.
As man ' s intellect and technology have evolved so too have the games he plays.
You need to be really an incredible artist.
You ' ll hear about talks like , can a video game make you cry ? 
So this is a student ' s opinion on what his experience of games are.
I ' m a video game addict and this is my story.
But as was the case for most of my generation , I spent a lot of time in front of the TV.
With the combination of simple , interactive stories and the warmth of the TV set , my simple 16-bit Nintendo became more than just an escape.
I ' m addicted , because even though I know I ' m losing my grip on reality , I still crave more.
A generation who may experience much more meaning through video games than they will through the real world.
I know I can.
I have come to expect this level of interaction.
It lies in that these games are beginning to make me emotional.
Then they use these emotions to dimensionalize the worlds they create.
No buttons to push , no triggers to pull , just me and the game.
These are all troubles outside of myself.
While some of these instincts may be innate , most are learned , and all of them are hardwired into our brains.
Consider this -- my real life car has about 25,000 miles on it.
It ' s a funny feeling when you have spent more time doing something on the TV than you have in real life.
I ' m not sure what the implications of my experience are , but the potential for using realistic video game stimuli in repetition on a vast number of loyal participants is frightening to me.
Imagine a game that teaches us to respect each other , or helps us to understand the problems we ' re all facing in the real world.
But as virtual and real world experiences increasingly overlap there is a greater and greater potential for other people to feel the same way I do.
I know though , that no matter how amazing video games may become , or how flat the real world may seem to us , that we must stay aware of what our games are teaching us and how they leave us feeling when we finally do unplug.
But as you heard , Michael talked about all these other elements as well.
Who is that going to come from ? 
They ' re going to do it their way , using the tools that we ' ve created.
Some of the ideas are really dreadful and some of them are great.
DP : I ' ve just got a little tiny bit more if you ' ll indulge me.
I ' m sitting at the front of the class , and they ' re actually pitching their ideas.
And as I ' ve shown here , we have the audience.
And as the student video showed , we can impact and move.
Games on the surface seem simple entertainment , but for those that like to look a little deeper , the new paradigm of video games could open entirely new frontiers to creative minds that like to think big.
With all the intensity and brilliance for which he is known , Alan Kay envisions better techniques for teaching kids by using computers to illustrate experience in ways -– mathematically and scientifically -- that only computers can.
A great way to start , I think , with my view of simplicity is to take a look at TED . Here you are , understanding why we ' re here , what ' s going on with no difficulty at all.
And I must say , I thought of quite a few objects that I might try to swallow today and finally gave up on , but he just did it and that was a wonderful thing.
And our friend , Betty Edwards , the  " Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain "  lady , shows these two tables to her drawing class and says ,  " The problem you have with learning to draw is not that you can ' t move your hand , but that the way your brain perceives images is faulty.
Now having seen that -- and I ' ve seen it hundreds of times , because I use this in every talk I give -- I still can ' t see that they ' re the same size and shape , and I doubt that you can either.
And the Talmud saw this a long time ago , saying ,  " We see things not as they are , but as we are. " 
Somehow we have to understand ourselves to get around our flaws.
And what ' s happened , over the last 400 years in particular , is that human beings have invented  " brainlets "  -- little additional parts for our brain -- made out of powerful ideas that help us see the world in different ways.
And yet , it is not taught in any K through 12 curriculum in America that I ' m aware of.
And in fact , what Murray was talking about yesterday in the fractal beauty of nature -- of having the descriptions at various levels be rather similar -- all goes down to the idea that the elementary particles are both sticky and standoffish , and they ' re in violent motion.
But then I had a thought of ,  " Boy , maybe it ' s too simple. " 
Not because it wasn ' t beautiful or anything , but because it misses the thing that most students fail to understand about molecular biology , and that is : why is there any probability at all of two complex shapes finding each other just the right way so they combine together and be catalyzed ? 
So , another thing that we do is to confuse adult sophistication with the actual understanding of some principle.
and bingo . That is all you have to do.
So she was like that jazz musician friend you have who never studied music but is a terrific musician ; she just had a feeling for math.
And what this teacher did on every project was to have the children act like first it was a creative arts project , and then something like science.
But the whole point of this thing is for them to look at this chart and fill it out.
And she could see that these were the square numbers up until about six , where she wasn ' t sure what six times six was and what seven times seven was , but then she was confident again.
And the mathematicians and scientists in the crowd will recognize these two progressions as a first-order discrete differential equation and a second-order discrete differential equation , derived by six-year-olds.
And so the first idea here is just to show you the kind of things that children do.
Each time I click it , car turn.
So what if I click this down to zero ? 
And we ' ll call this a wheel.
And it ' s interesting.
We ' re going to move the car according to that over and over again.
We get a visual pattern of what these nine-year-olds called acceleration.
Teacher : Do not pay any attention to what anybody else is doing.
AK : Stopwatches aren ' t accurate enough.
Teacher : Drop . Class : Whoa!
Now , what if we want to look at this more closely ? 
So what I ' m doing is measuring from the bottom of one image to the bottom of the next image , about a fifth of a second later , like that . And they ' re getting faster and faster each time , and if I stack these guys up , then we see the differences ; the increase in the speed is constant.
So you can ' t tell much from just making the ball drop there , but if we drop the ball and run the movie at the same time , we can see that we have come up with an accurate physical model.
So once you have gravity , here ' s this -- increase the speed by something , increase the ship ' s speed.
Yeah , there we go . Yeah , OK ? 
But we couldn ' t create 1,000 new teachers this summer to save our life.
And Einstein said ,  " Things should be as simple as possible , but not simpler. " 
515
And you know , I saw all the visions of the first couple of sessions.
I want to talk to you a little bit about why the visions of Jeremy Rivkins , who would like to ban these sorts of technologies , or of the Bill Joys who would like to relinquish them , are actually -- to follow those paths would be such a tragedy for us.
It ' s because we ' re flesh and blood.
And I ' m actually going to use his words in the same order that he did.
Life is short , you know.
And you know , I ' m getting a little bit gray -- so is Ray Kurzweil , so is Eric Drexler.
It wasn ' t two years ago that everybody was talking about -- we ' ve found the Holy Grail of biology.
And we ' ve all seen  " 2001 : A Space Odyssey. " 
So it ' s not surprising that some people would wonder whether maybe 30 or 40 years from now , we ' ll look back at this instant in time , and all of the sort of talk about the Human Genome Project , and what all this is going to mean to us -- well , it will really mean precious little.
If you have any doubts about how technology affects our lives , you just have to go to any major city.
It ' s going to happen a lot sooner than people imagine.
It ' s going to probably change the human lifespan.
It ' s changing our lives in so many ways , and it will continue to do that.
What we ' re doing is we are seizing control of our evolutionary future.
The most immediate changes that we ' ll see are things like in medicine.
That is going to be the IT challenge of the next generation , is communicating all this information.
But it ' s going to have a big impact because we ' re going to have niche drugs.
It ' s too risk-averse.
We ' re all identical to each other . Isn ' t it wonderful ?  " 
To deny that that ' s the case is not a very good start on that.
What if we could unravel aging and understand it -- begin to retard the process or even reverse it ? 
I mean Ritalin , Viagra , things of that sort , Prozac.
Probably not.
It ' s going to be very challenging to deal with.
There are three obvious ways of doing this.
It will happen in five to 10 years.
You take a six to eight cell embryo , you tease out one of the cells , you run a genetic test on that cell , and depending on the results of that test you either implant that embryo or you discard it.
And in that process that ' s going to morph from being just for diseases , to being for lesser vulnerabilities , like risk of manic depression or something , to picking personalities , temperaments , traits , these sorts of things.
And one that is not heritable because who would want to pass on to their children the archaic enhancement modules that they got 25 years earlier from their parents ? 
They are really going to come to operate in this realm.
Humanity is going to go down this path.
The second is , we ' re human.
The lines are going to blur . And they already are between therapy and enhancement , between treatment and prevention , between need and desire.
But ultimately all this is going to do is just shift development elsewhere.
So , sure , we need to debate these things.
They touch us too deeply.
This is the flowering of human endeavor. " 
There are too many people that think that high-technology medicine is going to keep them , save them , from overeating , from eating a lot of fast foods , from not getting any exercise.
There is a lot in this rich biota that is going to serve us well.
In fact this isn ' t just abstract.
If you look forward , I mean future humans , far before the end of this millennium , in a few hundred years , they are going to look back at this moment.
And they are actually going to romanticize this moment in time.
And then what comes out of it ?  New life.
We ' re going to make lots of errors.
It will always be remembered.
It ' s our health , it ' s our lives , it ' s our future , it ' s our children.
It ' s how we hold it in our hearts.
 " The bravest are surely those who have the clearest vision of what is before them , both glory and danger alike.

And when she was eight , last year , she was doing a report for school or she had some homework about frogs.
And then they become tadpoles and frogs. " 
So I kind of said ,  " Oh , it ' s this extra ingredient , you know , that you need to create a new frog from the mom and dad frog. " 
I was trying to remember all the guidebooks , and all I could remember was ,  " Only answer the question they ' re asking.
And I said ,  " Well , funny you should ask.
It ' s our own pond . And that ' s how it happens. " 
And so we ' re just eating , and her jaw just drops , and she goes ,  " Mom!
That ' s how we evolved . It does seem odd.
So how could that ever happen ?  " 
And I said ,  " Yes. " 
And I said ,  " ... " 
 " That is exactly right.
Oh ... " 
That ' s not how we do it. " 
I don ' t understand the legs. " 
And she goes ,  " But I just can ' t understand it. " 
And we watched them and I ' m so thankful , because she ' s just like ,  " Wow! This is so amazing. " 
And then I realized that I had taken my little eight year old ' s hand , and taken her right into Internet porn.
http://www.ted.com/talks/tal_golesworthy_how_i_repaired_my_own_heart.html
Tal Golesworthy : How I repaired my own heart
And in 1992 I participated in a genetic study and found to my horror , as you can see from the slide , that my ascending aorta was not in the normal range , the green line at the bottom.
The surgery on offer was pretty gruesome -- anesthetize you , open your chest , put you on an artificial heart and lung machine , drop your body temperature to about 18 centigrade , stop your heart , cut the aorta out , replace it with a plastic valve and a plastic aorta , and , most importantly , commit you to a lifetime of anticoagulation therapy , normally warfarin.
I can do this . I can change this.
So the possibility exists to simply externally wrap the pipe.
The great advantage of an external support for me was that I could retain all of my own bits , all of my own endothelium and valves , and not need any anticoagulation therapy.
Now that ' s a left ventricle pushing blood up through the aortic valve -- you can see two of the leaflets of the aortic valve working there -- up into the ascending aorta.
I ' ve got a real one in my pocket , if anyone would like to look at it and play with it.
So it ' s quite a difficult structure to produce.
We then use that former to manufacture a perfectly bespoke porous textile mesh , which takes the shape of the former and perfectly fits the aorta.
John Pepper , bless his heart , professor of cardiothoracic surgery -- never done it before in his life -- he put the first one in , didn ' t like it , took it out , put the second one in.
If you compare our new treatment to the existing alternative , the so-called composite aortic root graft , there are one of two startling comparisons , which I ' m sure will be clear to all of you.
He opens you up , he accesses the aorta while your heart is beating , all at the right temperature.
I don ' t take any drugs at all other than recreational ones that I would choose to take.
Even trips to the dentist require that you take antibiotics , in case you get an internal infection on the valve.
Well the answer to that is a multidisciplinary team.
Raad Mohiaddin , medical radiologist : We had to get good quality images from which to make the CAD model.
I would think no one in this room understands those four first jargon points there.
Taking the jargon out was very important to ensure that everyone in the team understood exactly what was meant when a particular phrase was used.
And then we realized that it was actually a mirror image of the real aorta.
So one needs to be careful with disciplinary conventions.
I was working with Imperial and the Brompton , and this generated some serious problems with the project , really problems that shouldn ' t exist.
We didn ' t only have the bureaucratic problems associated with that , was also had professional jealousies.
In the U.K . we have the National Institute for Clinical Excellence , NICE.
So any of the hospitals interested can come along , read the NICE report get in touch with us and then get doing it themselves.
It must be rubbish . They binned it.
I suppose ultimately the funding bureaucrats have really got to get their act together.
They don ' t want to change.
We ' ve actually got 30 patients.
It really is a problem . It really is a problem.
I think it ' s not good , but there you are , that ' s my view.
Dead easy to give him respect.
Translate that one . I bet they can ' t.
You can shortcut huge amounts of work simply by using the extended knowledge base you have.
Because I suspect there are absolutely standard surgical treatments probably in the USA which cost more for a one-off patient than the cost of us getting from my dream to my reality.
It would be a pleasure to speak with you . Many thanks.

It ' s a sort of paper-based reader.
But this is no news , right ? 
And you know the reason why , of course.
That makes a good cartoon.
That ' s true.
So we are bridging the digital divide.
Yeah.
And they were not used to that in communist 2.0 Vietnam.
And on the third day , I finally understood , the guy was actually on duty.
For those of you old enough to remember , we used to have to go to the store to steal it.
But yeah , it has liberated us from the office desk.
They are shaping the way we consume.
Now I shouldn ' t get into this.
They were used first by a Danish newspaper , which wanted to make a point on Islam.
And then , of course , they were used by extremists and politicians on the other side.
History tells us , they ' ve been used by the Nazis to attack the Jews.
This got me thinking.
You had a rebellion in the North , the government in the South -- the capital , Abidjan -- and in the middle , the French army.
I ' ve been doing this for the last 15 years ; it ' s my side job , if you want.
So this is really journalism in cartoons.
Those were poor guys fighting for their rights.
People fear them -- they help the rebellion a lot.
He said ,  " I can chop your head off right away and bring you back to life. " 
I mean , the press in Ivory Coast was bitterly divided -- it was compared to the media in Rwanda before the genocide -- so imagine.
We brought together cartoonists from all sides in Ivory Coast.
It ' s a great tool of communication for bad or for good.
I mean , they didn ' t agree with each other -- that was not the point.
So the idea was there.
So in Lebanon , we enrolled the newspaper editors , and we got them to publish eight cartoonists from all sides all together on the same page , addressing the issue affecting Lebanon , like religion in politics and everyday life.
And then in Kenya , what we did was addressing the issue of ethnicity , which is a poison in a lot of places in Africa.
Well I believe that in any context anywhere , he always has the choice at least not to do a cartoon that will feed hatred.
Today , tech companies are the world ' s largest editors.
http://www.ted.com/talks/peter_ward_on_mass_extinctions.html
Peter Ward on Earth ' s mass extinctions
And leave it to Hollywood to get it just right.
Every world has an alien , and every alien world has a flying saucer , and they move about with great speed . Aliens.
What we call an Earth-like planet is actually a very short interval of time.
I had a girl who came up who said ,  " My dad says you ' re the devil. " 
It was ,  " It burns! It burns! " 
And I really do think we have to start thinking about what ' s a good planet and what isn ' t.
I mean , there we are.
Even though it ' s Earth-like , and even though early in its history it may very well have harbored Earth-like life , it soon succumbed to runaway greenhouse -- that ' s an 800 degrees [Fahrenheit] surface -- because of rampant carbon dioxide.
We have as much time for animals to exist on this planet as they have been here now , till we hit the second microbial age.
So , a planet like us is going to have an age and an old age , and we are in its golden summer age right now.
Earth , if we ' re lucky enough -- if it doesn ' t get hit by a Hale-Bopp , or gets blasted by some supernova nearby in the next seven billion years -- we ' ll find under your feet.
And very soon after , the fossil record started yielding a very good idea of how many plants and animals there have been since complex life really began to leave a very interesting fossil record.
And what they found was something unexpected.
The chalk itself ' s composed by plankton which has fallen down from the sea surface onto the sea floor , so that 90 percent of the sediment here is skeleton of living stuff , and then you have that millimeter-thick red layer , and then you have black rock.
The effects of it spread this very thin impact layer all over the planet , and we had very quickly the death of the dinosaurs , the death of these beautiful ammonites , Leconteiceras here , and Celaeceras over here , and so much else.
Well , there are five major mass extinctions over the last 500 million years , called the Big Five.
The most recent , the Permian , was thought to have been an impact because of this beautiful structure on the right.
And when the comet hits , the pressure produces the buckyballs , and it captures bits of the comet.
I was so lucky to watch the change of that South Africa into the new South Africa as I went year by year.
These are mammal-like reptiles.
This is the top carnivore , the T-Rex of its time.
Hold still , you ' re the scale.
.. . and then a catastrophe happened.
You can see the eye socket and you can see the little teeth in the front.
Here ' s sort of the end of that 10 years of work.
The survivors that do get through produce this world of crocodile-like creatures.
And the what , I think , is that we returned , over and over again , to the Pre-Cambrian world , that first microbial age , and the microbes are still out there.
This suggests to me that life causing these mass extinctions because it did is inherently anti-Gaian.
There are microbes which , through their metabolism , produce hydrogen sulfide , and they do so in large amounts.
It turns purple from the presence of numerous microbes which have to have sunlight and have to have hydrogen sulfide , and we can detect their presence today -- we can see them -- but we can also detect their presence in the past.
They take the sediment itself , they extract the oil from it , and from that they can produce compounds which turn out to be very specific to particular microbial groups.
This led Lee Kump , and others from Penn State and my group , to propose what I call the Kump Hypothesis : many of the mass extinctions were caused by lowering oxygen , by high CO2 . And the worst effect of global warming , it turns out : hydrogen sulfide being produced out of the oceans.
And each of these looks like a hydrogen bomb ; actually , the effects are even worse.
But carbon dioxide is carbon dioxide.
We are at 380 and climbing.
All right , what ' s the consequence ?  The oceans probably turn purple.
We know hydrogen sulfide is erupting presently a few places on the planet.
And as we speak now , these nautilus are tracking out their behaviors to us.
So , I ' m swimming along , and it takes off my leg.
I ' m then thrown in an ice pond , I ' m cooled 15 degrees lower and I could be taken to a critical care hospital.
Tried to figure out how to save Americans after battlefield injuries.
I got this email from him two years ago ; he said ,  " I think I ' ve got an answer to some of your questions. " 
Six hours later , up goes the temperature.
Here is a way we can get people to critical care.
You ' re in an accident . You ' ve got two choices : you ' re going to die , or you ' re going to take the hydrogen sulfide and , say , 75 percent of you is saved , mentally.
We ' re going to save lives , but there ' s going to be a cost to it.
Give us a few millennia -- and we humans should last those few millennia -- will it happen again ?  If we continue , it ' ll happen again.
We have a huge problem facing us as a species.
Am I understanding you right , that what you ' re saying here is that we have in our own bodies a biochemical response to hydrogen sulfide that in your mind proves that there have been past mass extinctions due to climate change ? 
Does it leave a signal in bone or in plant ? 
http://www.ted.com/talks/auret_van_heerden_making_global_labor_fair.html
Auret van Heerden : Making global labor fair
One man died after working a 36-hour shift.
Cote d ' Ivoire , we have a huge problem of child slaves.
This is a mine in Zimbabwe right now.
And all of those products probably end their lives in a dump like this one in Manila.
Some of these governance gaps are run by rogue states.
Either way , they present us with a huge moral and ethical dilemma.
We need a reality check.
And right now , that independent republic of the supply chain is not being governed in a way that would satisfy us , that we can engage in ethical trade or ethical consumption.
But take the example of heparin.
The main American manufacturer of that active ingredient decided a few years ago to relocate to China because it ' s the world ' s biggest supplier of pigs.
This substitute cost nine dollars a pound , whereas real heparin , the real ingredient , cost 900 dollars a pound.
How did the Chinese State Agency for Food and Drugs allow this to happen ?  " 
They actually do conduct a few investigations overseas -- about a dozen a year -- maybe 20 in a good year.
We don ' t have a system to ensure that human rights , basic dignity , are ensured.
And you can just look at the headlines.
And the simple answer is they can ' t . They ' re national.
So , if we ' re going to ensure the delivery of the key public goods at an international level -- in this case , in the global supply chain -- we have to come up with a different mechanism.
And eventually President Clinton , in 1996 , convened a meeting at the White House , invited industry , human rights NGOs , trade unions , the Department of Labor , got them all in a room and said ,  " Look , I don ' t want globalization to be a race to the bottom.
They don ' t own those facilities.
You have a custodial duty , a duty of care , to make sure that that product gets from wherever to the store in a way that allows us to consume it , without fear of our safety , or without having to sacrifice our conscience to consume that product. " 
And that was a stroke of absolute genius , because what they did was they harnessed the power of the contract , private power , to deliver public goods.
Even if they did their jobs , and they cited those facilities for their violations , the fine would be derisory.
Now of course , this doesn ' t come naturally to multinational companies.
Now , getting there is not easy.
We can do it . The technical solutions are there.
It ' s crazy.
Well , we don ' t.
Transparency is absolutely critical to this.
Go to the website . Look at the audit results.
I hate the idea that governments are not protecting human rights around the world.
We ' re now thinking that , in fact , this is probably the start of a new way of regulating and addressing international challenges.
Look at the health systems in so many countries.
Absolutely.
 " You want me to deliver human rights throughout my global supply chain.
We have 4,000 companies who are members.
And whenever we discuss one of these problems that we have to address -- child labor in cottonseed farms in India -- this year we will monitor 50,000 cottonseed farms in India.
And human rights comes down to a very simple proposition : can I give this person their dignity back ? 
They didn ' t say money.
That ' s my simple proposition to you , my simple plea to every decision-maker in this room , everybody out there.
Join us , come into that safe space , and let ' s start to make this happen.

I want her to look at the world through the underside of a glass-bottom boat , to look through a microscope at the galaxies that exist on the pinpoint of a human mind , because that ' s the way my mom taught me.
Because there ' s nothing more beautiful than the way the ocean refuses to stop kissing the shoreline , no matter how many times it ' s sent away.
And yes , on a scale from one to over-trusting , I am pretty damn naive.
Remember that good things come in threes and so do bad things.
All right , so I want you to take a moment , and I want you to think of three things that you know to be true.
So here are three things I know to be true.
Why was the scarecrow invited to TED ? 
But there are plenty of things I have trouble understanding.
Spoken word poetry is the art of performance poetry.
And despite my fear of ever being looked at for too long , I was fascinated by the idea of spoken word poetry.
The poem was very indignant , and mainly exaggerated , but the only spoken word poetry that I had seen up until that point was mainly indignant , so I thought that that ' s what was expected of me.
And lightning struck.
And it was here , listening to these poets share their stories , that I learned that spoken word poetry didn ' t have to be indignant , it could be fun or painful or serious or silly.
Now I can divide my spoken word journey into three steps.
I love spoken word . I will keep coming back week after week. " 
It ' s about gathering up all of the knowledge and experience you ' ve collected up to now to help you dive into the things you don ' t know.
When I was in high school I had created Project V.O.I.C.E.
And we saw over and over the way that spoken word poetry cracks open locks.
And the first list that I assign is  " 10 Things I Know to be True. " 
Third , someone has something you ' ve never even heard of before.
But one of my students , a freshman named Charlotte , was not convinced.
So I assigned her list after list , and one day I assigned the list  " 10 Things I Should Have Learned by Now. " 
And so she wrote her first poem , a love poem unlike any I had ever heard before.
Now I know that the number one rule to being cool is to seem unfazed , to never admit that anything scares you or impresses you or excites you.
And yes , that means catching all of those miseries and hurt , but it also means that when beautiful , amazing things just fall out of the sky , I ' m ready to catch them.
I write musicals ; I make short films alongside my poems.
It ' s not uncommon for people to feel like they ' re alone or that nobody understands them , but spoken word teaches that if you have the ability to express yourself and the courage to present those stories and opinions , you could be rewarded with a room full of your peers , or your community , who will listen.
I ' m so lucky that there ' s this archive of performances that I can share with my students.
You have to grow and explore and take risks and challenge yourself.
I travel a lot while I ' m teaching , and I don ' t always get to watch all of my students reach their step three , but I was very lucky with Charlotte , that I got to watch her journey unfold the way it did.
And I wondered whether I ' d get to the end of this talk and finally have figured it all out , or not.
It ' s clear that when I was a child , I definitely walked through life like this.
When they bombed Hiroshima , the explosion formed a mini-supernova so every living animal , human or plant that received direct contact with the rays from that sun was instantly turned to ash.
She says I have old eyes.
My self-confidence can be measured out in teaspoons mixed into my poetry , and it still always tastes funny in my mouth.
In the original story , God told Sarah she could do something impossible and she laughed , because the first Sarah , she didn ' t know what to do with impossible.
It ' s what I strive for every time I open my mouth -- that impossible connection.
After the A-bomb , specialists said it would take 75 years for the radiation-damaged soil of Hiroshima City to ever grow anything again.
But in that instant , I get to share your present.
I don ' t know if I can change the world yet , because I don ' t know that much about it -- and I don ' t know that much about reincarnation either , but if you make me laugh hard enough , sometimes I forget what century I ' m in.

The war in Vietnam was raging ; the Civil Rights Movement was under way ; and pictures had a powerful influence on me.
They not only recorded history ; they helped change the course of history.
In the face of poor political judgment or political inaction , it becomes a kind of intervention , assessing the damage and asking us to reassess our behavior.
It gives a voice to those who otherwise would not have a voice.
Society ' s problems can ' t be solved until they ' re identified.
That was a tradition I wanted to follow.
In 1981 , I went to Northern Ireland.
During the early  ' 80s , I spent a lot of time in Central America , which was engulfed by civil wars that straddled the ideological divide of the Cold War.
At the same time , a civil war was taking place in El Salvador , and again , the civilian population was caught up in the conflict.
Without the political will to find common ground , the continual friction of tactic and counter-tactic only creates suspicion and hatred and vengeance , and perpetuates the cycle of violence.
A mosque in northern Bosnia was destroyed by Serbian artillery and was used as a makeshift morgue.
At the same time in South Africa , after Nelson Mandela had been released from prison , the black population commenced the final phase of liberation from apartheid.
Teenage boys lived in isolation , their bodies covered with white clay.
Elsewhere in Africa there was famine.
Hundreds of thousands of people were exterminated , slowly and painfully.
Again , international NGOs , united under the umbrella of the U.N. , staged a massive relief operation and thousands of lives were saved.
He literally had nothing . He was a virtual skeleton , yet he could still summon the courage and the will to move.
The next day I left for Rwanda , and it was like taking the express elevator to hell.
This time , maybe confused or discouraged by the military disaster in Somalia , the international community remained silent , and somewhere around 800,000 people were slaughtered by their own countrymen -- sometimes their own neighbors -- using farm implements as weapons.
They were received in refugee camps set up by NGOs in Albania and Macedonia.
This is a Chechen rebel on the front line against the Russian army.

And therefore I will limit myself to only talk about the links between religion and sexuality.
My talk will be about the impact of religions on the number of babies per woman.
When I was born there was less than one billion children in the world , and today , 2000 , there ' s almost two billion.
Will it remain the same and be two billion by the end of the century ? 
When you want to classify religion , it ' s more difficult than you think.
But that subdivides Christianity , Islam and Buddhism into many subgroups , which was too detailed.
And the color now is the majority religion.
That ' s where we find Islamic majority.
So we were careful with that.
And here the income per person in comparable dollars.
The exception was Japan.
But they were in Latin America or they were in Africa.
I start the world , and here we go.
And when we enter into this century , you ' ll find more than half of mankind down here.
I can tell you that the data on the number of children per woman is surprisingly good in all countries.
It has happened across the world.
There ' s no major difference between these religions.
But there are also countries here like Guatemala , like Papua New Guinea , like Yemen and Afghanistan.
Because the death of a child is compensated by one more child.
Congo will go from 60 to 120.
I take them backwards here to their independence , when they were up here in the beginning of the 1960s.
So what does it take ? 
You need to have access to some family planning.
If I take these countries back to the years of their independence , which is almost the same year --  ' 71 ,  ' 72 -- it ' s a quite amazing development which had happened.
Well I do as I always do.
These are the scholars and experts in the government agency in Qatar , and they say the most important factors are :  " Increased age at first marriage , increased educational level of Qatari woman and more women integrated in the labor force. " 
Now look again at this.
I strongly recommend Melinda Gates '  last TEDTalk.
The number of children is not growing any longer in the world.
But why do they grow if the number of children doesn ' t grow ? 
Each card box is one billion people.
Then there is one billion between 30 and 45 , almost one between 45 and 60.
So what will happen now is what we call  " the big fill-up. " 
So what will happen now is quite straightforward.
The rest will grow older and get two billion children.
And can you see that this increase took place without life getting longer and without adding children ? 
That is needed.
David Bismark demos a new system for voting that contains a simple , verifiable way to prevent fraud and miscounting -- while keeping each person ' s vote secret.
So there are a few things that bring us humans together in the way that an election does.
We cherish the opportunity to have our say , to help decide the future of the country.
You see , even if the idea of the election is perfect , running a countrywide election is a big project , and big projects are messy.
When you come back out , you get to drop your vote into the ballot box where it mixes with all the other votes , so that no one knows how you voted.
The ballot boxes go to counting places.
We have to trust a lot of procedures.
They ' ve zoomed out and looked at the big picture.
How do we make an election system completely verifiable while keeping the votes absolutely secret ? 
And that means , if you mark your choices on one of them and then remove the candidate list , I won ' t be able to tell from the bit remaining what your vote is for.
So this is how you vote.
So you let a poll station worker scan your encrypted vote.
And remember , the vote is encrypted from the moment you leave the voting booth , so if an election official wants to find out how you voted , they will not be able to.
Votes can ' t go missing because then you won ' t find yours when you look for it.
They can check that the announced result of the election is the correct one.
Accepting the 2006 TED Prize , Dr . Larry Brilliant talks about how smallpox was eradicated from the planet , and calls for a new global system that can identify and contain pandemics before they spread.
I ' m the luckiest guy in the world.
So , I ' m going to tell -- -- so , I ' m going to show you some dirty pictures.
When I was an intern in San Francisco , I heard about a group of Native Americans who had taken over Alcatraz Island , and a Native American who wanted to give birth on that island , and no other doctor wanted to go and help her give birth.
Someone saw me on television ; they called me up ; and they asked me if I ' d like to be in a movie and to play a young doctor for a bunch of rock and roll stars who were traveling in a bus ride from San Francisco to England . And I said , yes , I would do that , so I became the doctor in an absolutely awful movie called  " Medicine Ball Caravan. " 
We switched buses at the big pond . We then got on two more buses and we drove through Turkey and Iran , Afghanistan , over the Khyber Pass , into Pakistan , like every other young doctor.
This is just like a residency program , for those of you that are in medical school.
And this document is the certificate that the global commission signed certifying the world to have eradicated the first disease in history.

More than two -- you ' re reading about Larry Page already , somebody reads very fast.
Never can you doubt that we are all in this together.
You ' re a mother and you ' re watching your child , and on day six , you see pustules that become hard.
By day nine , you look at this picture , and you ' re horrified.
There are other kinds of smallpox that are not like that.
I ' ve probably had 50 women die . They all had hemorrhagic smallpox.
By 1970 , we were down to 18 countries.
In 1974 , India had a population of 600 million.
So , how we eradicated smallpox was -- max vaccination wouldn ' t work.
And that ' s what we did.
When we didn ' t search , we had the illusion that there was no disease.
We raised the reward . We continued to increase the reward.
150,000 people from all over the world , doctors of every race , religion , culture and nation , who fought side by side , brothers and sisters , with each other , not against each other , in a common cause to make the world better.

Instead of finding out what we thought was the case -- that blindness was caused mostly by glaucoma and trachoma -- we were astounded to find out that blindness was caused instead by cataract.
Aravind , which started as a Seva project , is now the world ' s largest and best eye hospital.
We will not have a vaccine or adequate supplies of an antiviral to combat bird flu if it occurs in the next three years.
There ' ll be no airplanes flying.
What do you think the likelihood is that there ' ll be a pandemic ? 
And they thought that if there was a pandemic , a billion people would get sick.
Let me show you a simulation of what a pandemic looks like so we know what we ' re talking about.
Then there ' ll be secondary outbreaks , and the disease will spread from country to country so fast that you won ' t know what hit you.
We have a joke . This is an epidemic curve , and everyone in medicine , I think , ultimately gets to know what it is.
What we really want is to arrive right here , so we can stop the epidemic.
And it didn ' t occur because GPHIN found the pandemic-to-be of SARS three months before WHO actually announced it , and because of that we were able to stop the SARS pandemic.
We need an early-warning system to protect us against the things that are humanity ' s worst nightmare.
Pandemic bird flu -- early detection , early response . It is a litany.
But in all seriousness -- because this idea is birthed in TED , I would like it to be a legacy of TED , and I ' d like to call it the  " International System for Total Early Disease Detection. " 
Instead of industrial accidents like oil spills or the catastrophe in Bhopal , we find them , and we respond to them.
Let ' s increase the websites that they crawl from 20,000 to 20 million.
And we ' ll add Gapminder ' s amazing graphics to the front end.
Larry Brilliant : First of all , you ' re not mad about the copyright violation ? 
Immediate detection , immediate response.
But they were able to point to WHO and let them know that there was this surprising and unexplained cluster of illnesses that looked like bird flu.
Now , what ' s really important is that , before there was GPHIN , 100 percent of all the world ' s reports of bad things -- whether you ' re talking about famine or you ' re talking about bird flu or you ' re talking about Ebola -- 100 percent of all those reports came from nations.
Now their reporting percentage is down to 50 percent because other nations have started to report.
Well , they ' re only crawling in seven languages.
There ' s an angry divisive tension in the air that threatens to make modern politics impossible . Elizabeth Lesser explores the two sides of human nature within us that can be harnessed to elevate the way we treat each other . She shares a simple way to begin real dialogue -- by going to lunch with someone who doesn ' t agree with you , and asking them three questions to find out what ' s really in their hearts.
This room may appear to be holding 600 people , but there ' s actually so many more , because in each one of us there is a multitude of personalities.
There was this equation in my family that went something like this : if you are intelligent , you therefore are not spiritual.
So , looking for answers , I went to Catholic mass.
And I said to myself ,  " I wanna get me one of them. " 
Now , see this strange , underwater , coral reef-looking thing ? 
They ' ve made me a proud I-don ' t-know-it-all.
She says ,  " Excuse me , I ' m pissed off , and I know a few things , and we better get busy about them right now. " 
This, "  he wrote ,  " is the interrelated structure of reality. " 
But we all actually have the same capacity that they do , and we need to do their work now.
They ' re supposedly tongue-in-cheek , but they ' re actually dangerous.
The worst eras in human history , whether in Cambodia or Germany or Rwanda , they start like this , with negative other-izing.
And I realize we ' re all busy people , so don ' t worry , you can do this on a lunch break.
Maybe that person who worships at the mosque , or the church or the synagogue , down the street.
A couple of weeks ago , I took a Conservative Tea Party woman to lunch.
So first of all , decide on a goal : to get to know one person from a group you may have negatively stereotyped.
And listen.
And what have you always wanted to ask someone from the other side ? 
 " What ?  "  she wanted to know.
And since we had established some trust , we believed in each other ' s sincerity.
But we also hadn ' t pretended that our differences were just going to melt away after a lunch.
And what might happen at your lunch ? 
It ' s two people dropping the pretense of being know-it-alls.

Ryan Lobo : Photographing the hidden story
And at the end of a shoot , I would sometimes feel that I had photographs that told a better story than a sometimes-sensational documentary.
And over there I experienced other people ' s suffering , up close and personal , immersed myself in some rather intense and emotional stories , and at times I experienced great fear for my own life.
And I decided that I had compromised , just like my friends in those discussions , where we told stories in contexts we made excuses for , rather than taking responsibility for.
Paradoxically , when I let go of these objectives , and worked from a place of compassion and purpose , looking for excellence , rather than the results of it , everything arrived on its own , including fulfillment.
In 2007 I went to Liberia , where a group of my friends and I did an independent , self-funded film , still in progress , on a very legendary and brutal war-lord named General Butt Naked.
And he is probably the most prolific mass murderer alive on Earth today.
How do you live with yourself if you know you ' ve committed horrific crimes ? 
He seeked forgiveness , and he claims to endeavor to improve the lives of his child-soldiers.
He begs for forgiveness , and receives it from the same woman whose brother he murdered.
In this photograph a hostile crowd in a slum surrounds him.
But the question is , does forgiveness and redemption replace justice ? 
Liberia has been devastated by one of Africa ' s bloodiest civil wars , which has left more than 200,000 people dead , thousands of women scarred by rape and crime on a spectacular scale.
The commander told me that a woman could gauge a potentially violent situation much better than men.
And yes , all of those people killed were male.
We know how to deal with these fellows, "  and ignored them.
And one editor told me that she wasn ' t interested in doing what she called  " manual labor stories. " 
Something amazing happened during this shoot.
But nonetheless , despite the hostility , firefighters left the vehicle and successfully fought the fire.
But the question that lingered in my mind was , what causes people to destroy fire trucks headed to their own homes ? 
They lack even the most basic amenities.
In India we often love to complain about our government bodies.
And I ' ve had very serious doubt about its efficacy , and my own faith in humanity.
It seems that this story helped change perceptions about the DFS , at least in the minds of an audience in part on televisions , read magazines and whose huts aren ' t on fire.
http://www.ted.com/talks/julian_assange_why_the_world_needs_wikileaks.html
Julian Assange : Why the world needs WikiLeaks
Julian Assange : Yeah , can it possibly be true ? 
And how do you secure their privacy ? 
CA : So you make an effort to ensure the documents are legitimate , but you actually almost never know who the identity of the source is ? 
So let ' s take [an] example , actually.
Can you tell us what you leaked and what happened ? 
He was a soft dictator of Kenya.
So I went there in 2007 , and we managed to get hold of this just prior to the election -- the national election , December 28.
And so it came in from the outside.
JA : Yep.
Radio : .. . just fuckin '  , once you get on  ' em just open  ' em up.
Light  ' em all up.
Hotel .. . Bushmaster Two-Six , Bushmaster Two-Six , we need to move , time now!
Two-Six , this is Two-Six , we ' re mobile.
JA : The impact on the people who worked on it was severe.
JA : Yeah . Two Reuters employees , two young children were wounded.
JA : I don ' t know . I guess people can see the gross disparity in force.
I mean , did he ? 
I mean , I was a known visitor of that embassy.
JA : Well , because these sort of things reveal what the true state of , say , Arab governments are like , the true human-rights abuses in those governments.
Why is it right to encourage leaking of secret information ? 
And that ' s what we ' ve found in practice , and that ' s what the history of journalism is.
We have a way of dealing with information that has sort of personal -- personally identifying information in it.
It shows a U.S . soldier laughing at people dying.
JA : Yeah , we do get a lot of that.
It will change the perception and opinion of the people who are paying for it all , and that ' s our hope.
JA : Not really . I mean , we don ' t have any WikiLeaks dissidents yet.
You know , there might be a couple of views of WikiLeaks and of Julian.
Who ' s got the dangerous troublemaker view ? 
Now here ' s something that you haven ' t yet leaked , but I think for TED you are.
So late last year -- in November last year -- there was a series of well blowouts in Albania , like the well blowout in the Gulf of Mexico , but not quite as big.
We couldn ' t verify it because we didn ' t know who wrote it and knew what it was about.
The material looks good , it feels right , but we just can ' t verify it. " 
Can you show that you had legal authority over that document ? 
That ' s happened quite a lot though.
So our publication rate over the past few months has been sort of minimized while we ' re re-engineering our back systems for the phenomenal public interest that we have.
JA : Yep . Yeah , and trusted people.
Can that be right ? 
CA : And you were also -- I mean , you were also a hacker at an early age and ran into the authorities early on.
So you have to be careful with hacker.
CA : Yeah , well , I certainly don ' t think you ' re stealing anyone ' s grandmother ' s bank account , but what about your core values ? 
And that ' s something from my father and something from other capable , generous men that have been in my life.
CA : So just tell us , very quickly in the last minute , the story : what happened in Iceland ? 
JA : Yeah , this is a great case , you know.
Anyway , so we release this report in July last year.
Iceland ' s a Nordic country , so , like Norway , it ' s able to tap into the system.
When you think of the future then , do you think it ' s more likely to be Big Brother exerting more control , more secrecy , or us watching Big Brother , or it ' s just all to be played for either way ? 
That ' s why it ' s a very interesting time to be in -- because with just a little bit of effort , we can shift it one way or the other.
Artist Nathalie Miebach takes weather data from massive storms and turns it into complex sculptures that embody the forces of nature and time . These sculptures then become musical scores for a string quartet to play.
What you just heard are the interactions of barometric pressure , wind and temperature readings that were recorded of Hurricane Noel in 2007.
Weather is an amalgam of systems that is inherently invisible to most of us.
I then compare my information to the things I find on the Internet -- satellite images , weather data from weather stations as well as offshore buoys.
And from all of these numbers , I start with only two or three variables.
When I assign values to the vertical and horizontal elements , I can use the changes of those data points over time to create the form.
These forms are completely made up of weather data or science data.
The vertical elements are assigned a specific hour of the day.
I also translate weather data into musical scores.
And together , these variables construct a score.
What I love about this work is that it challenges our assumptions of what kind of visual vocabulary belongs in the world of art , versus science.
You place it in a music hall , it all of a sudden becomes a musical score.
So for me , that was my way into it.

However , grilled chicken poses a hidden danger.
Studies show that antioxidants are known to decrease these heterocyclic amines.
Now you might wonder how a 13 year-old girl could come up with this idea.
So I was very surprised about this.
So I combined these two ideas and I formulated a hypothesis , saying that , could possibly the carcinogens be decreased due to a marinade and could it be due to the differences in PH ? 
Most of the others either never responded back , said they didn ' t have the time or didn ' t have the equipment and couldn ' t help me.
The second stage was completed at the Penn State University main campus lab , which is where I extracted the chemicals , changed the PH so I could run it through the equipment and separated the compounds I needed from the rest of the chicken.
The saltwater marinade and the brown sugar marinade also worked very well , decreasing the carcinogens by about 60 percent.
And I found that if you increase the time cooked , the amount of carcinogens rapidly increases.
Now I ' m not saying that if you eat grilled chicken that ' s not marinated , you ' re definitely going to catch cancer and die.
Shree Bose : Hi everyone . I ' m Shree Bose.
Sounds ridiculous , right.
My older brother Panaki Bose spent hours of his time explaining atoms to me when I barely understood basic algebra.
So , armed with all the wisdom of freshman year biology , I decided I wanted to do cancer research at 15.
And then went on , my next summer , to work under Dr . Basu at the UNT Health Center at Fort Worth , Texas.
In fact , one in 70 women will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer.
Sounds great , right ? 
In fact , it ' s one of the biggest problems with chemotherapy today.
And we thought it had something to do with this protein called AMP kinase , an energy protein.
But those are dots on a screen for you ; what exactly does that mean ? 
In fact , it means that if a patient comes in and they ' re resistant to this drug , then if we give them a chemical to block this protein , then we can treat them again with the same drug.
It was about finding my passion.
It was about inspiration and determination and never giving up on my interest for science and learning and growing.
One death every 20 seconds.
It confused me ; why did these allergy symptoms persist well past the pollen season ? 
But soon after , I developed a novel mathematical model that essentially quantifies the effect of these environmental pollutants on the lung health of asthmatic patients.
For example , volatile organic compounds are chemical pollutants that are found in our schools , homes and workplaces.
So today I want to show you my interactive software model that I created.
And this can be used by anyone.
So that peak expiratory flow rate , I ' ve entered it up into the interactive software model.
And this report really drives home the crux of my research.
So the doctor sees this difference between the yellow bar and the blue bar , and he says ,  " Wow , we need to give her steroids , medication and inhalers. " 
And if you ' re remodeling your house , take out all the carpeting and put in hardwood flooring. " 
But before I end my talk today , I want to leave you with one saying.
But if each one of us takes initiative in our own home , in our own school and in our own workplace , we can make a huge difference in air quality.
Lisa Ling : Right.
http://www.ted.com/talks/yang_lan.html
Yang Lan : The generation that ' s remaking China
And I told her ,  " I ' m going to Scotland the next day. " 
Because it was a line from our Chinese parallel Susan Boyle -- a 50-some year-old woman , a vegetable vendor in Shanghai , who loves singing Western opera , but she didn ' t understand any English or French or Italian , so she managed to fill in the lyrics with vegetable names in Chinese.
So I guess both Susan Boyle and this vegetable vendor in Shanghai belonged to otherness.
We are all different from different perspectives.
I remember that in the year of 1990 , when I was graduating from college , I was applying for a job in the sales department of the first five-star hotel in Beijing , Great Wall Sheraton -- it ' s still there.
That was the first day I set my foot in a five-star hotel.
Why can ' t they have their own ideas and their own voice ?  " 
After seven rounds of competition , I was the last one to survive it.
Well after a few years , I decided to go to the U.S . and Columbia University to pursue my postgraduate studies , and then started my own media company , which was unthought of during the years that I started my career.
But then we are also so fortunate to witness the transformation of the whole country.
But then sometimes I ' m thinking , what are today ' s young generation up to ? 
Well this is a girl called Guo Meimei -- 20 years old , beautiful.
The controversy was so heated that the Red Cross had to open a press conference to clarify it , and the investigation is going on.
But anyway , the public still doesn ' t buy it.
Microblog boomed in the year of 2010 , with visitors doubled and time spent on it tripled.
About 80 percent of those microbloggers are young people , under 30 years old.
So how are they different ? 
Most of them have fairly good education.
And you know we have the tradition that younger generations support the elders financially , and taking care of them when they ' re sick.
In urban areas , college graduates find the starting salary is about 400 U.S . dollars a month , while the average rent is above $500.
Among the 200 million migrant workers , 60 percent of them are young people.
And they ' re more vulnerable to job losses , subject to inflation , tightening loans from banks , appreciation of the renminbi , or decline of demand from Europe or America for the products they produce.
For those who do return back to the countryside , they find themselves very welcome locally , because with the knowledge , skills and networks they have learned in the cities , with the assistance of the Internet , they ' re able to create more jobs , upgrade local agriculture and create new business in the less developed market.
But then in the last two years , it goes up again to 39 percent , indicating a rising living cost.
And also , the bitterness and even resentment towards the rich and the powerful is quite widespread.
For the past decade or so , a massive urbanization and development have let us witness a lot of reports on the forced demolition of private property.
So the good news is that earlier this year , the state council passed a new regulation on house requisition and demolition and passed the right to order forced demolition from local governments to the court.
They have sorts of ingredients that you brush on a piece of chicken or fish , and it turns it to look like beef.
While young people seem to be very sure about their participation in public policy-making , but sometimes they ' re a little bit lost in terms of what they want for their personal life.
They ' re not rich at all.
So in the next picture , you see a very popular phenomenon called  " naked "  wedding , or  " naked "  marriage.
People were donating money , dog food and offering volunteer work to stop that truck.
After thousands of resends in relay , the child was found , and we witnessed the reunion of the family through microblogging.
How are we going to perform our social and political reform to keep pace with economic growth , to keep sustainability and stability ? 
http://www.ted.com/talks/aimee_mullins_prosthetic_aesthetics.html
Aimee Mullins and her 12 pairs of legs
So I just pictured a first grade teacher out in the lobby with these unruly kids , saying ,  " Now , whatever you do , don ' t stare at her legs. " 
The doors open , the kids descend on this table of legs , and they are poking and prodding , and they ' re wiggling toes , and they ' re trying to put their full weight on the sprinting leg to see what happens with that.
 " No . It should be Go Go Gadget! " 
And the whole room , including me , was like ,  " Yeah. " 
So some of you actually saw me at TED , 11 years ago.
I had woven carbon fiber sprinting legs modeled after the hind leg of a cheetah , which you may have seen on stage yesterday.
Well , lucky for me , a lot of people answered that call.
Curious encounters were happening to me at the time ; I ' d been accepting numerous invitations to speak on the design of the cheetah legs around the world.
I thought ,  " Well , that ' s amazing , because I don ' t feel disabled. " 
And interestingly , from an identity standpoint , what does it mean to have a disability ? 
So , three months after TED I found myself on a plane to London , doing my first fashion shoot , which resulted in this cover --  " Fashion-able "  ? 
Poetry matters.
The artist Matthew Barney , in his film opus called the  " The Cremaster Cycle. " 
Heavy!
14 hours of prosthetic make-up to get into a creature that had articulated paws , claws and a tail that whipped around , like a gecko.
Today , I have over a dozen pair of prosthetic legs that various people have made for me , and with them I have different negotiations of the terrain under my feet , and I can change my height -- I have a variable of five different heights.
Her mouth dropped open when she saw me , and she went ,  " But you ' re so tall! " 
And she looked at me , and she said ,  " But , Aimee , that ' s not fair. " 
It is no longer a conversation about overcoming deficiency.
It can stand as a symbol that the wearer has the power to create whatever it is that they want to create in that space.
I think of Shakespeare ' s Shylock :  " If you prick us , do we not bleed , and if you tickle us , do we not laugh ?  " 
business,creativity,entertainment,law,technology
I ' m going to tell you three stories on the way to one argument that ' s going to tell you a little bit about how we open user-generated content up for business.
This is what he had to say.
We will not have a vocal chord left, "  Sousa said.
We could describe it using modern computer terminology as a kind of read-write culture.
Culture where creativity was consumed but the consumer is not a creator.
Never before has creativity of the millions been as effectively displaced , and displaced because of these , quote ,  " infernal machines. " 
Now , that was a pretty good system for most of the history of the regulation of land , until this technology came along , and people began to wonder , were these instruments trespassers as they flew over land without clearing the rights of the farms below as they traveled across the country ? 
And so they appealed to Lord Blackstone to say these airplanes were trespassing.
Common sense , a rare idea in the law , but here it was . Common sense -- -- Revolts at the idea . Common sense.
So , between 1931 and 1939 , they raised rates by some 448 percent , until the broadcasters finally got together and said , okay , enough of this.
Now , ASCAP said they didn ' t care.
Okay . Three stories . Here ' s the argument.
By which I don ' t mean amateurish culture , I mean culture where people produce for the love of what they ' re doing and not for the money.
It ' s how they understand access to this culture.
And this is the best.
My first love ...
I want to share all my love with you ...
So , this is remix , right ? 
Now , the importance of this is not the technique that you ' ve seen here.
These tools of creativity have become tools of speech.
Instead , the architecture of copyright law and the architecture of digital technologies , as they interact , have produced the presumption that these activities are illegal.
Common sense here , though , has not yet revolted in response to this response that the law has offered to these forms of creativity.
And on the other side , among our kids , there ' s a growing copyright abolitionism , a generation that rejects the very notion of what copyright is supposed to do , rejects copyright and believes that the law is nothing more than an ass to be ignored and to be fought at every opportunity possible.
It failed partly because the courts are too passive , partly because the legislatures are corrupted , by which I don ' t mean that there ' s bribery operating to stop real change , but more the economy of influence that governs how Congress functions means that policymakers here will not understand this until it ' s too late to fix it.
We don ' t have a public domain to draw upon now , so instead what we need is two types of changes.
Now , I would talk about one particular such plan that I know something about , but I don ' t want to violate TED ' s first commandment of selling , so I ' m not going to talk about this at all.
It ' s the point about how this connects to our kids.
It is technology that has made them different , and as we see what this technology can do , we need to recognize you can ' t kill the instinct the technology produces . We can only criminalize it.
We can only make them , quote ,  " pirates. "  And is that good ? 
That realization is extraordinarily corrosive , extraordinarily corrupting.

Juan Enriquez on genomics and our future
Because if you spend this week thinking about Iraq and thinking about Bush and thinking about the stock market , you ' re going to miss one of the greatest adventures that we ' ve ever been on.
And if you want to take a single crystal of DNA , it looks like that.
If you think that the mapping of America ' s made a difference , or landing on the moon , or this other stuff , it ' s the map of ourselves and the map of every plant and every insect and every bacteria that really makes a difference.
And we could start dating things , and we could start changing medicine and archeology.
And that mutation was passed on to their kids because they ' re the ones that survived , so there was a great deal of population pressure.
And we ' re beginning to find these little things for malaria , for sickle cell , for cancers.
I thought we ' d talk about the new zoo.
Because we ' re just beginning to learn where we came from and what we are.
And if you ' re thinking of efficient information storage mechanisms , it may not turn out to be chips.
And then finally somebody picked up a microscope and looked at the water that was sitting next to the cores.
This little thingamajig : we didn ' t know this thingamajig existed.
And what you ' re looking at with this namibiensis is the biggest bacteria we ' ve ever seen.
This is a really odd one . This is Ferroplasma.
So , it ' s not just dogs and cats and whales and dolphins that you should be aware of and interested in on this little journey.
And it ' s just beginning to understand this code of DNA that ' s really the most exciting intellectual adventure that we ' ve ever been on.
When you do that , the cow gives birth to a gar.
But it turns out that as we learn more about gene code and how to reprogram species , we may be able to close the gene gaps in deteriorate DNA.
And in other places , like Maryland , they ' re trying to figure out what the primordial ancestor is.
Huge gene sequencing facilities the size of football fields.
We will have a 1,000-dollar genome within the next five to eight years.
And Laurie ' s going to talk about this one a little bit.
This apple is the same thing as this floppy disk.
Next line of code , TACGGGG : make a flower that ' s white , that blooms in the spring , that smells like this.
This changes all rules . This is life , but we ' re reprogramming it.
And you can do some pretty strange things because in the same way as you can reprogram this apple , if you go to Cliff Tabin ' s lab at the Harvard Medical School , he ' s reprogramming chicken embryos to grow more wings.
But because each of your cells contains your entire gene code , each cell can be reprogrammed , if we don ' t stop stem cell research and if we don ' t stop genomic research , to express different body functions.
Right ? 
This is the way it should be seen.
I won ' t go there.
They look at the same world and they say...
That ' s what your genes are doing every day.
That brings up questions of privacy and insurability and all kinds of stuff , but it also allows us to start going after diseases , because if you run a person who has leukemia through something like this , it turns out that three diseases with completely similar clinical syndromes are completely different diseases.
If it is not expressing in your body , if you don ' t have one of those types -- a particular one of those types -- don ' t take Gleevec.
Changes the nature of medicine . Changes the predictions of medicine.
Let me say that again : A single genomics company generates more data in a month , on a compound basis , than is in the printed collections of the Library of Congress.
This is on a log scale , and that ' s what superexponential growth means.
One of the really interesting questions is , if all this data ' s free , who ' s using it ?  This is the greatest public library in the world.
That is the genomically literate world . And that is a problem.
And you can break it out by counties , because it ' s specific counties.
And that ' s the triangle between Salk , Scripps , UCSD , and it ' s called Torrey Pines Road.
In an agricultural society , the difference between the richest and the poorest , the most productive and the least productive , was five to one . Why ? 
And very soon it ' s going to matter if you ' re literate in life code.
And it turns out that if you went back to the 1870s , the most productive nation on earth was Australia , per person.
Just smart people moving bits . Different rules.
It ' s got nothing to do with inflation.
Well , watch what happens to India.
They didn ' t foment the businesses . They didn ' t do the IPOs.
It turns out that if you ' d gone to the U.N . in 1950 , when it was founded , there were 50 countries in this world.
And this doesn ' t include fusions or name changes or changes in flags.
And , given that the music is over , I was going to talk about how you can use this to generate a lot of wealth , and how code works.
What would a music video look like if it were directed by the music , purely as an expression of a great song , rather than driven by a filmmaker ' s concept ?  Designer Jakob Trollback shares the results of his experiment in the form.
I’m working a lot with motion and animation , and also I ' m an old DJ and a musician.
And I think that it ' s maybe interesting , also , that it deals with two problematic issues , which are rising waters and religion.
And the song began to move on I understand like this.
And then he went and knocked an old lady house.
And the old lady said ,  " Oh yes , come on in. " 
culture,psychology,science,society
Also , the person to your left is a liar.
Now speaking of trust , ever since I wrote this book ,  " Liespotting, "  no one wants to meet me in person anymore , no , no , no , no , no.
Maybe you could have focused on cooking . How about French cooking ?  " 
I watch that TV show  ' Lie To Me. '  I know you ' re lying. " 
Think about it , a lie has no power whatsoever by its mere utterance.
Now not all lies are harmful.
Or we say , favorite of the digiratti ,  " You know , I just fished that email out of my spam folder.
Last year saw 997 billion dollars in corporate fraud alone in the United States.
Think Enron , Madoff , the mortgage crisis.
And you can ' t find this guy on Google ; you can ' t find him anywhere.
They ' re ready to give you something for whatever it is they ' re hungry for. " 
We wish we were better husbands , better wives , smarter , more powerful , taller , richer -- the list goes on.
Now granted , many of those are white lies.
We ' re essentially against lying.
Men lie eight times more about themselves than they do other people.
It you ' re unmarried , that number drops to three.
We parse it out on an as-needed basis , sometimes for very good reasons , other times just because we don ' t understand the gaps in our lives.
It ' s part of our culture , it ' s part of our history.
Now you might remember Koko.
It ' s her cute little , fluffy pet kitten.
How early ? 
Five-year-olds lie outright.
By the time we enter this work world and we ' re breadwinners , we enter a world that is just cluttered with spam , fake digital friends , partisan media , ingenious identity thieves , world-class Ponzi schemers , a deception epidemic -- in short , what one author calls a post-truth society.
Trained liespotters get to the truth 90 percent of the time.
We all make the same mistakes . We all use the same techniques.
Bill Clinton : I want you to listen to me.
And these allegations are false.
Studies show that people who are overdetermined in their denial will resort to formal rather than informal language.
Now if he had repeated the question in its entirety , or if he had peppered his account with a little too much detail -- and we ' re all really glad he didn ' t do that -- he would have further discredited himself.
And we all do it no matter how powerful you are.
With body language , here ' s what you ' ve got to do.
Well guess what , they ' re known to freeze their upper bodies when they ' re lying.
But a trained liespotter can spot a fake smile a mile away.
They cannot be consciously contracted , especially if you overdid the Botox.
Can you start to find the hot spots to see the discrepancies between someone ' s words and someone ' s actions ? 
They ' re going to be enthusiastic.
They ' re going to be infuriated if they sense they ' re wrongly accused throughout the entire course of the interview , not just in flashes ; they ' ll be infuriated throughout the entire course of the interview.
Ask a deceptive person to tell their story , they ' re going to pepper it with way too much detail in all kinds of irrelevant places.
We rehearse our words , but we rarely rehearse our gestures.
Now that smile is known in the trade as  " duping delight. " 
John Edwards : I ' d be happy to participate in one.
Interviewer : Are you going to do that soon ?  Is there somebody -- JE : Well , I ' m only one side . I ' m only one side of the test.
Murderers are known to leak sadness.
It ' s still somewhat of a healthy relationship.
Here ' s what it looks like.
Science has surfaced many , many more indicators.
Now here ' s the deal.
We ' re human beings.
Look , listen , probe , ask some hard questions , get out of that very comfortable mode of knowing , walk into curiosity mode , ask more questions , have a little dignity , treat the person you ' re talking to with rapport.
And as I promised , we ' re now going to look at what the truth looks like.
This mother , Diane Downs , shot her kids at close range , drove them to the hospital while they bled all over the car , claimed a scraggy-haired stranger did it.
Diane Downs : At night when I close my eyes , I can see Christie reaching her hand out to me while I ' m driving , and the blood just kept coming out of her mouth.
Here you ' re going to see no false emotion , just the authentic expression of a mother ' s agony.
And I don ' t understand it , and I never will.
And these technologies are going to be marketed to all of us as panaceas for deceit , and they will prove incredibly useful some day.
And what ' s kind of interesting is that today we have so little darkness.
So one challenge we have is to remember , oversharing , that ' s not honesty.
You start up that path of being just a little bit more explicit , because you signal to everyone around you , you say ,  " Hey , my world , our world , it ' s going to be an honest one.

Chris Abani on the stories of Africa
So , I ' ve got a little sheet of paper here , mostly because I ' m Nigerian and if you leave me alone , I ' ll talk for like two hours.
But also , most importantly , all the invisible people behind TED that you just see flitting around the whole place that have made sort of this space for such a diverse and robust conversation.
Like , what have I got to say about all this ? 
I guess there goes my green card.
So if news is anything to go by , the U.S . is right there with Zimbabwe , right ? 
The truth is , everything we know about America , everything Americans come to know about being American , isn ' t from the news.
It comes from the novels , the movies , the fashion magazines.
That ' s very important.
My love is like twelve Ethiopian goats standing still in the morning light.
It ' s important because misreading is really the chance for complication and opportunity.
And for some reason , in Cameroon , when they tried to translate the Bible into Cameroonian patois , they chose the Igbo version.
You know , we often think that language mirrors the world in which we live , and I find that ' s not true.
It can only be understood in the context of story , and everything , all of this is story.
Nigeria got its independence in 1960.
So , what it says to me then is that it ' s not really -- the problem isn ' t really the stories that are being told or which stories are being told , the problem really is the terms of humanity that we ' re willing to bring to complicate every story , and that ' s really what it ' s all about.
And Tom opens up his lunch box and there ' s rice in it , and he goes on this rant about ,  " Twenty years , my wife has been packing rice for lunch.
And now the inquest -- you know , Tom ' s wife and Dick ' s wife are distraught.
So what seems like an eccentric if tragic joke about Harry becomes a way to spread ethnic hatred.
It makes sense now when I think about it , because if you ' d known my father , you would ' ve wanted to poison him too.
So what he did was to teach us Jewish Holocaust history , and so huddled around books with photographs of people in Auschwitz , I learned the melancholic history of my people through the melancholic history of another people.
Story is fluid and it belongs to nobody.
And it happened over four continents.
I grew up very privileged , and it ' s important to talk about privilege , because we don ' t talk about it here.
I was completely terrified , completely broken , and kept trying to find a new language , a new way to make sense of all of this.
In fact , we were talking last night about how all of the steamy novels of Harold Robbins had done more for sex education of horny teenage boys in Africa than any sex education programs ever had.
And Fraser ' s on his knees , arms tied behind his back , and he ' s crying.
And we want to say to Idris ,  " Chop him up.
Idris pauses , then he moves again , and Fraser says ,  " Please!
And I ' m not saying this to save myself , although this would be nice . I ' m doing it to save you , because if you do this , you will be lost. " 
African narratives in the West , they proliferate.
And this is the difficulty that I face.
And I asked millions of people , without questioning my right to do so , to go up against the government.
Have I not myself been beaten ?  " 
I have been human six days , but only sometimes. " 
As I was telling Rachel from Google Earth , that I had challenged my students in America -- I said ,  " You don ' t know anything about Africa , you ' re all idiots. " 
There are no essential Africans , and most of us are as completely ignorant as everyone else about the continent we come from , and yet we want to make profound statements about it.
Not because I was encountering homosexual sex and love for the first time , but because the way James wrote about it made it impossible for me to attach otherness to it.
My friend Ronald Gottesman says there are three kinds of people in the world : those who can count , and those who can ' t.
 " Gazelle , I killed you for your skin ' s exquisite touch , for how easy it is to be nailed to a board weathered raw as white butcher paper.

Caleb Chung plays with Pleo
And before that , I was a silversmith , and before that , I was -- I was out of the house at about 15 and a half , and I never wound up going into college.
Anyway , I wanted to show you a little bit about the world of toy design , at least from my small aperture of the world.
You know , you think it ' s so cool , but they -- anyway , I made this little tape that I ' d always show when I go in.
So this is a hamburger maker that you take the peanut butter and stuff and you put it in there , and it makes -- and this is a French fry maker , little , tiny food you can eat.
And let ' s see , you can make the pie and cinnamon and sugar , and then you eat , and you eat , and you eat , and you -- she ' s about 300 pounds now.
And it got me through some -- I didn ' t make any royalties on this , but it got me through.
This is some effects that I did for  " Wig , Rattle and Roll. " 
And they go ,  " Oh , that ' s really nice, "  and out it goes.
They ' re pretty cool.
It ' s how they , see , have those album things -- kids don ' t know what they are.
And then , I made a Lego animator.
Then I started doing animatronics.
This is me using [unclear] or 3-D Studio , back in the  ' 80s.
This is a segment called ,  " Dangerous Toys You Won ' t See at Christmas. " 
This is MEK going through a windshield wiper motor.
And you can see the massively parallel processing Nintendos there.
You can actually see the Steadicam with a bubble on the bottom.
Narrator : I love toys!
You get one out of 20 , one out of 30 products.
Throughout this whole thing , making toys , I think there is a real correlation with innovation and art and science.
And actually , this is , to me , how I can come up with great ideas.
But moving on.
So by way of showing you this , you can kind of get an understanding of what it is to , hopefully , try to create robotic life forms , or technology that has an emotional connection with the user.
I came out of the movie business , as I said , and I said , let ' s make these animatronic robots.
This is a smaller one , and I have a little moving torso on there.
Oh , this is a little pony , little pony -- very cute little thing.
And , you know , they had lots , just lots of stuff in there that you didn ' t need , I thought.
What ' s the fewest pieces we could use to make a little life form ? 
I have the why over here , and the how over there.
And originally , Furby only had two eyes and some batteries on the bottom.
Well , I came up with this kind of linear expression thing with these cams and feedback . And that worked pretty well.
There ' s my first exploded view and all the little pieces and the little worm drive and all that stuff.
And there ' s the first little cam that drove Furby.
So there ' s the back of his head with a billion holes in it.
So my wife says ,  " Well , you may like it , but nobody else will. " 
She ' s an actual , you know , artist.
And then she started doing these other images.
There ' s my favorite , Demon Furby.
I actually went to Toys " R " Us , got a little furry cat , ripped it apart and made this.
It ' s just a little server control and I made a little video going :  " Hi , my name ' s Furby , and I ' m good, "  you know , and then I ' d reach my hand.
And so Dave and I got working.
And we started -- this was way back before there was really much SLA going on , not a lot of rapid prototyping.
So they ran all the shells for us , which was nice of them.
But they have a closed system , so you couldn ' t print the things out on the machine.
And then they looked like little Garfields there.
I -- it ' s unbelievable how -- I don ' t know how that can be.
Why do you , you know , try to do this stuff ? 
So I kind of retired , and we ' re already living in paradise up in Boise , on a river , you know . So and then I started another company called Toy Innovation and we did some projects with Mattel with actually with a lady who ' s here , Ivy Ross , and we did Miracle Moves Baby , made it in Wired magazine , did a bunch of other stuff.
So I said ,  " OK , let ' s try to do this dinosaur project. " 
Not a robot that kind of does , but let ' s really go for it.
And so we actually went in.
There ' s a kind of truncated Camarasaurus skeleton , but the geometry ' s correct.
And about this time , you know , all these other people are starting to help.
There ' s the mechanism that would go in there , kind of a Geneva drive.
There ' s the skull , pretty much the same shape as the Camarasaurus.
And the thing about blending science and art in this multidisciplinary stuff is you can do a robot , and then you go back and do the shape , and then you go back and forth.
All the neck and the tail are cable , so it moves smoothly and organically.
So you hire artists , and you try to get the look and feel of the character.
Now you start doing the sculpture for this.
John , do you want to bring him up ? 
All right -- -- no , it ' s very painful , so -- -- these are little Pleos and you can probably see them.
So this one , this one ' s actually asleep , and -- hang on.
They have seven processors , they have 14 motors , they have -- but you don ' t care , do you ? 
That ' s good , wake up , wake up , wake up.
Here , here , here . Have some money , Pleo.
And we think we can help that out by having little creatures that you can love.
And we have a -- I have a little something here.
Excuse me , Pleo.
Anyone can take Pleo and they can totally redo his personality.
We have one animator who ' s taken it and he ' s done a take on the Budweiser beer commercial , and they ' re going ,  " Whassup, "  you know ? 
And there ' s a lot of social responsibility in that.
At TEDxChange , Melinda Gates makes a provocative case for nonprofits taking a cue from corporations such as Coca-Cola , whose plugged-in , global network of marketers and distributors ensures that every remote village wants -- and can get -- a Coke . Why shouldn ' t this work for condoms , sanitation , vaccinations too ? 
One of my favorite parts of my job at the Gates Foundation is that I get to travel to the developing world , and I do that quite regularly.
My first trip in India , I was in a person ' s home where they had dirt floors , no running water , no electricity , and that ' s really what I see all over the world.
In fact , when I travel to the developing world , Coke feels ubiquitous.
But I think , as a community , we still have a lot to learn.
So why does this matter ? 
So that ' s why I took a bit of time to study Coke.
So let ' s start with the data.
They learn something , they put it back into the product , they put it back into the market.
So if sales start to drop , then the person can identify the problem and address the issue.
I had somebody from an NGO once describe it to me as bowling in the dark.
So what ' s the second thing that Coke ' s good at ? 
But Coke noticed something -- they noticed that local people were taking the product , buying it in bulk and then reselling it in these hard-to-reach places.
There are now some 3,000 of these centers employing about 15,000 people in Africa.
Governments and NGOs need to tap into that local entrepreneurial talent as well , because the locals know how to reach the very hard-to-serve places , their neighbors , and they know what motivates them to make change.
They decided that wasn ' t good enough , so they went to India and studied the Indian state of Kerala that also had a system like this , and they adapted it for Ethiopia.
Now , think about how this can change people ' s lives.
So what ' s the next step for Ethiopia ? 
That ' s how you tap into local entrepreneurial talent and you unlock people ' s potential.
So , they rely on Coca-Cola in terms of its marketing , and what ' s the secret to their marketing ? 
Coke ' s global campaign slogan is  " Open Happiness. " 
Now , that played itself out in the World Cup campaign.
And it went number one on the pop chart in 17 countries.
Well , it ' s based on avoidance , not aspirations.
It doesn ' t sound anything like  " Wavin '  Flag "  to me.
One example is sanitation.
People reuse it for a slab for their home.
Well , you work with the community.
And it works -- look at these headlines.
Now , it ' s not just a funny headline -- it ' s innovative . It ' s an innovative marketing campaign.
They ' re waiting to be circumcised.
But it turns out the men do , because they ' re hearing from their girlfriends that they prefer it , and the men also believe it improves their sex life.
And polio , I think , is one of the most powerful examples.
Well how did that happen ? 
But let me make the story a little bit more concrete for you.
By August 30th , a genetic test was done , and we knew what strain of polio Shriram had.
So many more people would have been affected.
So in less than a month , we went from one case of paralysis to a targeted vaccination program.
It ' s not the marketing on the ground.
So by next summer , we ' re sighted to run out of money on polio.
And it would only be the second disease ever wiped off the face of the planet.
To me , that is deep happiness.
economics,fish,mission blue,oceans,science
And let me start with this.
If Joe jumped in a coral reef , there are many things the alien could see.
And where the diver is , this is probably where most of the reefs of the world are now , with very few corals , algae overgrowing the corals , lots of bacteria , and where the large animals are gone.
And let ' s start with this time machine , the Line Islands , where we have conducted a series of National Geographic expeditions.
We did 250 hours of diving here in 2005.
Fanning Island , 2,500 people.
And many people think this is really , really beautiful , if this is your baseline.
But then , if we shift the dial 200 , 500 years back , then we get to the places where the corals are absolutely healthy and gorgeous , forming spectacular structures , and where the predators are the most conspicuous thing , where you see between 25 and 50 sharks per dive.
If we get all of the fish of a coral reef together and weigh them , this is what we would expect.
But this is a consequence.
The good news is that , in addition to having more predators , there ' s more of everything.
Not only do these places -- these ancient , pristine places -- have lots of fish , but they also have other important components of the ecosystem like the giant clams ; pavements of giant clams in the lagoons , up to 20 , 25 per square meter.
But the water gets warmer for too long and the corals die.
In Fanning Island , the corals are not recovered.
And when you go to the pristine side , did this ever bleach ? 
We need to make sure that all of the pieces of the ecosystem are there so the ecosystem can adapt to the effects of global warming.
And let me go back to that image of the Mediterranean.
But , little did I know , until I jumped for the first time in a marine reserve.
And this particular place , the Medes Islands Marine Reserve , is only 94 hectares , and it brings 6 million euros to the local economy , 20 times more than fishing , and it represents 88 percent of all the tourist revenue.
The number of species increases 21 percent ; so if you have 1,000 species you would expect 200 more in a marine reserve.
And the biomass -- this is the most spectacular change -- 4.5 times greater biomass on average , just after five to seven years.
If you don ' t kill the fish , they take a longer time to die , they grow larger and they reproduce a lot.
One point three million eggs per square meter inside the marine reserve where these snails are very abundant.
So the fishermen are catching more.
Reserves are like savings accounts.
This is how much fishermen get everyday in Kenya , fishing over a series of years , in a place where there is no protection ; it ' s a free-for-all.
Another example : Nassau groupers in Belize in the Mesoamerican Reef.
When I went there for the first time in 2000 , there were only 3,000 groupers left.
It happened in many places around the Caribbean.
If this is so good , if this is such a no-brainer , how much of this do we have ? 
The estimated range is between 20 and 50 percent for a series of goals of biodiversity and fishery enhancement and resilience.
Well , there are a couple estimates of how much it would cost to create a network of protected areas covering 20 percent of the ocean that would be only a fraction of what we are now paying ; the government hands out to a fishery that is collapsing.
If it ' s so clear that these savings accounts are good for the environment and for people , why don ' t we have 20 , 50 percent of the ocean ? 
The problem is that we can create these large reserves only in places where there are no people , where there is no social conflict , where the political cost is really low and the economic cost is also low.
Second , the governance is not right because most coastal communities around the world don ' t have the authority to monitor the resources to create the reserve and enforce it.
So marine conservation and coastal protection has become a sink for government or philanthropic money , and this is not sustainable.
Second , we need to redesign our governance so conservation efforts can be decentralized , so conservation efforts don ' t depend on work from NGOs or from government agencies and can be created by the local communities , like it happens in the Philippines and a few other places.
And I ' d like to finish with one thought , which is that no one organization alone is going to save the ocean.
Chris Anderson : Thank you Enric.
How could 85 percent survive on 15 percent ? 
The animals at the lower parts of the food chain , they reproduce very fast ; they grow really fast ; they produce millions of eggs.
They are like capacitors of the system.
What we found in coral reefs is that the inverted pyramid is the equivalent of the Serengeti , with five lions per wildebeest.
But we have started studying pristine reefs only very recently.
If the world was a smarter place , we could solve this problem for negative 19 billion dollars.
CA : Okay , so there ' s a lot of examples that I ' m hearing out there about ending this subsidies madness.
Talk to me about the feeling that you must have experienced of going to these pristine areas and seeing things coming back.
And there , only there , you really feel that you are part of a larger thing or of a larger global ecosystem.
ES : Thank you very much.

I teach high school math.
I could give you guys an algebra-two final exam , and I would expect no higher than a 25 percent pass rate.
For example , factoring quadratics with leading coefficients greater than one.
all but ensures they won ' t retain it.
You finish your lecture block and immediately you have five hands going up asking you to re-explain the entire thing at their desks.
And then the other one percent is eagerly looking for the formula to apply in that situation.
He called it ,  " an impatience with irresolution. " 
I am very concerned about this because I ' m going to retire in a world that my students will run.
It applies equally to math.
I ' m sure we all agree that no problem worth solving is like that.
You could literally , I mean this , pass this particular unit without knowing any physics , just knowing how to decode a textbook . That ' s a shame.
But what you have here is actually four separate layers , and I ' m curious which of you can see the four separate layers and , particularly , how when they ' re compressed together and presented to the student all at once , how that creates this impatient problem solving.
So I hope you can see.
So right here I start with the visual , and I immediately ask the question : Which section is the steepest ? 
And we realize how great would it be if we just had some A , B , C and D labels to talk about them more easily.
And at that point , I ' ll put it to you that nine out of 10 classes are good to go on the whole slope , steepness thing.
And I ' ll yield the floor here for a second to Einstein , who , I believe , has paid his dues.
I like this question . It ' s about a water tank.
And then notice that all the information written on there is stuff you ' ll need.
Such an underrepresented question in math curriculum.
So now we have the real deal.
It ' s tedious.
And I ' ve got kids who will not join a conversation about math because someone else has the formula ; someone else knows how to work the formula better than me , so I won ' t talk about it.
We put names on the board , attach them to guesses , and kids have bought in here.
And that ' s terrifying , because the theoretical models that always work out in the answer key in the back of a teacher ' s edition , that ' s great , but it ' s scary to talk about sources of error when the theoretical does not match up with the practical.
We ' re no longer averse to word problems , because we ' ve redefined what a word problem is.
And why this is an amazing time to be a math teacher right now is because we have the tools to create this high-quality curriculum in our front pocket.
Oh , and by the way , here ' s how I made your stuff better, "  which , wow.
Math makes sense of the world.

David Gallo on life in the deep oceans
The truth of the matter is that the Titanic -- even though it ' s breaking all sorts of box office records -- it ' s not the most exciting story from the sea.
The average depth is about two miles.
Most of the earthquakes and volcanoes are in the sea , at the bottom of the sea.
We have to have a very special technology to get into that unfamiliar world.
Here ' s a jelly.
But see all those different working things ? 
It ' s a colonial animal.
Most of the biomass in the ocean is made out of creatures like this.
They come in all different sizes and shapes.
They ' re very little understood.
We see those at all depths and even at the greatest depths.
In this case , we ' re passing down through the mid-ocean and we see creatures like this.
This is basically scientific data that you ' re looking at.
They ' re actually looking at them down in that world.
And we ' re over the Atlantic -- that ' s the ridge right there -- but we ' re going to go across the Caribbean , Central America , and end up against the Pacific , nine degrees north.
And there ' s tens of thousands of those mountains out there that haven ' t been mapped yet.
This is an icon of our robot , Jason , it ' s called.
We see it either as sound , or we see it as video , or we see it as photographs , or we see it as chemical sensors , but we never have yet put it all together into one interesting picture.
Gets up to 600 , 700 degrees F , somewhere in that range.
We weren ' t really aware that it would be so rich with sulfides , hydrogen sulfides.
On either side of us are mountain ranges that are higher than the Alps , so the setting here is very dramatic.
What we find out now is that it ' s probably coming from inside the Earth.
All the energy to support these life forms is coming from inside the Earth -- so , chemosynthesis.
But they have two types of gill structures.
Now , they normally retract as soon as a crab touches them.
BL : These worms live in a real temperature extreme.
And here ' s a male.
Here they go.
DG : Two octopods at about two miles depth.
You can see this shrimp is harassing this poor little guy here , and he ' ll bat it away with his claw . Whack!
And the crabs don ' t like it at all.
The red dot is the laser light of the submarine Alvin to give us an idea about how far away we are from the vents.
Here ' s a tiny , little vent that ' s come out of the side of that pillar.
BL : You see this white V-shaped mark on the back of the shrimp ? 
DG : All this stuff is happening along that 40,000-mile long mountain range that we ' re calling the ribbon of life , because just even today , as we speak , there ' s life being generated there from volcanic activity.
This one ' s several stories tall.
Now here ' s a closer view of that community.
I think this is the neatest-looking thing.
It ' s unbelievable . It ' s basically sulfuric acid , and it ' s being just dumped out , at incredible rates.
There are a number of groups that are proposing that life evolved at these vent sites.
Here ' s a crab with his claw right at the end of that tube worm , waiting for that worm to stick his head out.
Not only that , but on top -- the lifeblood -- that plumbing system turns off every year or so.
You ' re talking about biodensities and biodiversity , again , higher than the rainforest that just springs back to life.
There ' s a story in the sea , in the waters of the sea , in the sediments and the rocks of the sea floor.
The continents move apart . They come back together.

Charles Leadbeater went looking for radical new forms of education -- and found them in the slums of Rio and Kibera , where some of the world ' s poorest kids are finding transformative new ways to learn . And this informal , disruptive new kind of school , he says , is what all schools need to become.
It ' s a great pleasure to be here.
Where is the Small Hadron Collider ? 
The whole Hadron Collider family needs unlocking.
The question that you will ask will determine much of the answer that you get.
The Finns may be a bit boring and depressive and there ' s a very high suicide rate , but by golly , they are qualified.
Because actually radical innovation does sometimes come from the very best , but it often comes from places where you have huge need -- unmet , latent demand -- and not enough resources for traditional solutions to work -- traditional , high-cost solutions , which depend on professionals , which is what schools and hospitals are.
Most of the population growth of the next 50 years will be in cities.
This is where you ' ll find the fastest growing young populations of the world.
At the age of 14 , in common with many 14-year-olds in the Brazilian education system , he dropped out of school.
He was turning over 200,000 dollars a week.
1994 , Rodrigo started something called CDI , which took computers donated by corporations , put them into community centers in favelas and created places like this.
Millions of people living here , stretched over many kilometers.
So there are schools in slums like this.
And the education they got was pitiful.
So the challenges of education in this kind of place are not to learn the kings and queens of Kenya or Britain.
It ' s the mobile phone.
The remarkable thing about these girls , and the sign of the kind of social revolution sweeping through the developing world is that these girls are not married.
All across the developing world there are millions of parents -- tens , hundreds of millions -- who for the first time are with children doing homework and exams.
This is the best you can get in Hyderabad in Indian education.
They know nothing about Wikipedia.
Well , education is a global religion.
Most of the children there have parents who are illiterate.
Most of our education system is push.
That isn ' t really going to attract him.
You need to start education from things that make a difference to them in their settings.
Our education systems all work on the principle that there is a payoff , but you have to wait quite a long time.
And you also need to make it intrinsically interesting.
In the schools and communities that Taio works in , the day always starts in a circle and always starts from a question.
They attract people to learning because it ' s really a dance project or a circus project or , the best example of all -- El Sistema in Venezuela -- it ' s a music project.
And what you find when you go to these schemes is that they use people and places in incredibly creative ways.
You create peer-to-peer learning , or you create para-teachers , or you bring in specialist skills.
It has 30,000 children on those building sites.
And they all treat learning , not as some sort of academic , analytical activity , but as that ' s something that ' s productive , something you make , something that you can do , perhaps earn a living from.
So the trendiest schools in the world , High Tech High and others , they espouse a philosophy of learning as productive activity.
And I learned it from this guy , who is an amazing character.
It ' s the largest NGO in education in the world.
When they got to a certain stage , Pratham got big enough to attract some pro bono support from McKinsey.
And it ' s the same wherever you go.
Why can ' t we do it more like the Chinese restaurants ?  " 
You know a Chinese restaurant when you see it.
So mass education started with social entrepreneurship in the 19th century.
They fail to reach the people they most need to serve.
There are two basic types of innovation.
And as I said , the trouble with this is that , in the developing world there just aren ' t teachers to make this model work.
We need more reinvention.
There are Kunskapsskolan schools in Sweden.
And they all have the same kind of features : highly collaborative , very personalized , often pervasive technology , learning that starts from questions and problems and projects , not from knowledge and curriculum.
The most famous of these is Reggio Emilia in Italy , the family-based learning system to support and encourage people in schools.
And finally , you need transformational innovation that could imagine getting learning to people in completely new and different ways.
But it is , unlike cars , which have developed so rapidly and orderly , actually the school system is recognizably an inheritance from the 19th century , from a Bismarkian model of German schooling that got taken up by English reformers , and often by religious missionaries , taken up in the United States as a force of social cohesion , and then in Japan and South Korea as they developed.
It will bring skills and learning and reading.
And we are bequeathing to the developing world school systems that they will now spend a century trying to reform.
aging,culture,health
We are living on average today 34 years longer than our great-grandparents did.
We ' re still living with the old paradigm of age as an arch.
But many people today -- philosophers , artists , doctors , scientists -- are taking a new look at what I call the third act , the last three decades of life.
What is the appropriate new metaphor for aging ? 
And guess what ? 
Some of the studies even say we ' re happier.
And I got scared.
I have such a powerful feeling of well-being.
I don ' t want to romanticize aging.
One third of it , in fact , is genetic.
Now let me say something about the staircase , which may seem like an odd metaphor for seniors given the fact that many seniors are challenged by stairs.
There ' s only one exception to this universal law , and that is the human spirit , which can continue to evolve upwards -- the staircase -- bringing us into wholeness , authenticity and wisdom.
It was about a man named Neil Selinger -- 57 years old , a retired lawyer -- who had joined the writers group at Sarah Lawrence where he found his writer ' s voice.
In this article , Mr . Selinger wrote the following to describe what was happening to him.
As I lost so much , I finally started to find myself. " 
Perhaps they weren ' t able to love us beyond how we performed in the world.
Perhaps the task of the third act is to finish up the task of finishing ourselves.
And I realized that , in order to know where I was going , I had to know where I ' d been.
How did they treat my parents ? 
You may discover , as I did , that a lot of things that you used to think were your fault , a lot of things you used to think about yourself , really had nothing to do with you.
You can work to change your relationship to your past.
And he wrote this :  " Everything you have in life can be taken from you except one thing , your freedom to choose how you will respond to the situation.
It turns out that cognitive research shows when we are able to do this , it manifests neurologically -- neural pathways are created in the brain.
And if we can maintain the more positive feelings about the past , that becomes the new norm.
Women start off whole , don ' t we ? 
But very often , many , if not most of us , when we hit puberty , we start worrying about fitting in and being popular.
Older women are the largest demographic in the world.
biology,botany,environment,life,science,sex
There are a quarter of a million -- at least those are the ones we know about -- a quarter of a million species of flowering plants.
Why would they go to that bother ? 
You can take cuttings ; they can sort of have sex with themselves ; they can pollinate themselves.
Some of you may have seen some of these pictures before.
Most pollen that causes hay fever for us is from plants that use the wind to disseminate the pollen , and that ' s a very inefficient process , which is why it gets up our noses so much.
The insects and other species can take the pollen , transfer it directly to where it ' s required.
The plant gets something , and the hawk-moth spreads the pollen somewhere else.
And there ' s an orchid that might look to you as if it ' s got jaws , and in a way , it has ; it forces the insect to crawl out , getting covered in pollen that it takes somewhere else.
This orchid , known as Darwin ' s orchid , because it ' s one that he studied and made a wonderful prediction when he saw it -- you can see that there ' s a very long nectar tube that descends down from the orchid.
And I mean , normally it kind of rolls it away , but in its erect form , that ' s what it looks like.
This is a plant here that insects in South Africa just love , and they ' ve evolved with a long proboscis to get the nectar at the bottom.
So not only has the fly not got the nectar from the mimic plant , it ' s also -- if you look very closely just at the head end , you can see that it ' s got a bit of pollen that it would be transmitting to another plant , if only some botanist hadn ' t come along and stuck it to a blue piece of card.
So it probably even feels good for the insect , as well as looking good.
Sometimes the whole plant mimics an insect , even to us.
I think of it as insidium sometimes.
So it ' s deceiving on two levels -- fabulous.
They ' re sending out a fantastic array of scent to any insect that ' ll have it.
They fly in and they pollinate.
And blowflies just can ' t help themselves.
I photographed this thing last week in Dorset.
At night they get covered in pollen , which showers down over them , and then the bristles that we saw above , they sort of wilt and allow all these midges out , covered in pollen -- fabulous thing.
This is the most amazing thing.
And that ' s twice the energy output , weight for weight , than a hummingbird -- absolutely astonishing.
 " Now why does it do this, "  I hear you ask.
And what a wonderful thing it is.
Insects see green , blue and ultraviolet , and they see various shades of ultraviolet.
So what is an insect seeing ? 
This is what it looks like if you take out the red.
Now we don ' t know exactly what a bee sees , any more than you know what I ' m seeing when I call this red.
And that ' s the sort of thing that it would be seeing.
Finally , there ' s one of evening primrose that Bjorn Rorslett from Norway sent me -- fantastic hidden pattern.
Venus , of course , is the god of love and fertility , which is the flower story.
arts,collaboration,data,design,technology,visualizations
We ' re collecting and creating all kinds of data about how we ' re living our lives , and it ' s enabling us to tell some amazing stories.
So I ' m going to show you a few of the projects that I ' ve been working on over the last couple years that reflect on our lives and our systems.
Followed by that , you see on the West coast planes moving across , the red-eye flights to the East coast.
I think it ' s one thing to say there ' s 140,000 planes being monitored by the federal government at any one time , and it ' s another thing to see that system as it ebbs and flows.
And you can zoom in . This is taking a look at Atlanta.
And you can scroll around and see some of the different airports and the different patterns that they have.
Moving across to the West coast , you see San Francisco and Los Angeles -- big low-traffic zones across Nevada and Arizona.
And you can see , over time , the ways the airports change.
This is visualizing international communications.
This is another project I worked on with Sensible Cities Lab and CurrentCity.org.
This is looking at another event . This is called Queen ' s Day.
And you can pause it and step back and forth and see different phases.
And it ' s this amazing robot that plays chess extremely well , except for one thing : it ' s not a robot at all.
So they made this web service and said ,  " Any programmer can write a piece of software and tap into the minds of thousands of people. " 
What does this mean for the future of mankind , where we ' re all plugged into this borg ?  " 
I asked people to draw a sheep facing to the left.
Lots of sheep.
I think there ' s something really interesting to watching people as they go through this creative toil -- something we can all relate to , this creative process of trying to come up with something from nothing.
Approximate collection rate of 11 sheep per hour , which would make a working wage of 69 cents per hour.
And there were 7,599 people that contributed to the project , or were unique IP addresses -- so about how many people contributed.
And I think it ' s a pretty valid question.
And there ' s this reference to  " Le Petit Prince "  where the narrator asks the prince to draw a sheep.
It ' s about your own interpretation and doing something different. " 
So there were no longer shoe makers , but now there are people slapping soles on people ' s shoes.
And this was the inspiration for a project that I worked on with my friend Takashi Kawashima.
But here there was no sheep-like criteria.
And you can also trade real hundred-dollar bills for fake hundred-dollar bills and make a donation to the Hundred Dollar Laptop Project , which is now known as One Laptop Per Child.
Here on the right-hand side in the middle you see this one guy writing ,  " $0.01!!! Really ?  " 
You may recognize these two guys.
So we resynthesized this song.
This is what it would look like if you went to the site.
After previewing it and confirming it ' s what you submitted , you could submit it into the Mechanical Turk with no other context.
So if you go to the BicycleBuiltforTwoThousand.com you can actually hear what all this sounds like together.
So basically motion through 3D space.
We made a music video for one of my favorite bands , Radiohead.
A whole YouTube channel of people submitting really interesting content.
And we started bouncing around ideas to make a collaborative music video project.
The lyrics to the leading track are  " Ain ' t no grave can hold my body down. " 
So what we did was cross-cut a bunch of archival footage of Johnny Cash , and at eight frames a second , we allowed individuals to draw a single frame that would get woven into this dynamically changing music video.
Johnny Cash : ♫ There ain ' t no grave ♫ ♫ can hold my body down ♫ ♫ There ain ' t no grave ♫ ♫ can hold body down ♫ ♫ When I hear the trumpet sound ♫ ♫ I ' m going to ride right out of the ground ♫ ♫ Ain ' t no grave ♫ ♫ can hold my body .. . ♫ AK : What better way to pay tribute to the man than to make something for one of his songs.
Collaborator Three : For all of the frames to be drawn by fans , each individual frame , it ' s got a very powerful feeling to it.
And I just worked and worked through problems , until my little wee battles that I was fighting within the picture all began to resolve themselves.
You ' re hearing a person ' s life.
If you roll over any one of those individual thumbnails , you can see the person who drew that individual thumbnail and where they were located.
In addition to that , it ' s listed , the artist ' s name , the location , how long they spent drawing it.
You can say ,  " I want to see the pointillist version or the sketchy version or the realistic version.
It ' s an online music video for the Arcade Fire.
What if we had a very low commitment , but delivered something individually unique to each person who contributed ? 
Win Butler : ♫ Now our lives are changing fast ♫ ♫ Now our lives are changing fast ♫ ♫ Hope that something pure can last ♫ ♫ Hope that something pure can last ♫ ♫ Ooh we used to wait ♫ ♫ Ooh we used to wait ♫ ♫ Ooh we used to wait ♫ ♫ Sometimes it never came ♫ ♫ Sometimes it never came ♫ ♫ Still moving through the pain ♫ ♫ We used to wait for it ♫ ♫ We used to wait for it ♫ ♫ We used to wait for it ♫ AK : So I think , if there ' s one thing to take away from my talk today , it ' s that an interface can be a powerful narrative device.
art,arts,creativity,storytelling
I cut stories.
So I didn ' t come to papercutting in a straight line.
As a teenager , I was sketching , drawing , and I wanted to be an artist.
I worked in tourism for one year in Mexico , one year in Egypt.
So of course , it took time , and I was nearly 40 , and I decided it ' s time to start as an artist.
So the word  " silhouette "  comes from a minister of finance , Etienne de Silhouette.
So artist books have a lot of definitions.
And I have a passion for images and for words.
So I ' m always looking for the false cognates or identical words in different languages.
So one of these works is the  " Spelling Spider. " 
So you can read  " architecture active "  or  " active architecture. " 
So scrolls are very convenient , because you can create a large image on a very small table.
It ' s to have a look at different worlds.
And I revisit this world thinking about the image or cliché about what we want to do , and what are the words , colloquialisms , that we have with the expressions.
And we would leave a very low footprint on the planet.
And we can use them also as a safety net.
Other ones are historical.
And sometimes I have an emotional response to news , such as the 2010 Haitian earthquake.
I call them Freudian cities.
 " MAD Growth on Columbus Circle. " 
 " Daily Battles. " 
So it ' s actually a papercut that ' s nine yards long.
And parallel to my cutting is my running.
Then I ran 50 miles -- ultramarathons.
The result is  " Hells and Heavens. " 
There is no border in between.
You have sweatshops in hells.
And in papercutting , you have the drawing as the structure itself.
They are more our social identities.
In fact , in the picture , you have two of them.
So artist books , you take them off the wall.
So it ' s regional memories , and they are just randomly moved by the wind.
It was for a merger station for emergency workers and firemen.
With public art , I could also make cut glass.
It is travel in time , travel on time.
So I started in the center with the acorn for the Ohlone Indian civilization.
So the technique , it ' s cut , sandblasted , etched and printed glass into architectural glass.
So it ' s a tree , and in its trunk you have the roots of languages.
So in Aurora , Colorado it ' s a bench.
And it ' s called  " Seeds of the Future are Planted Today. " 
And here I ' ve been working for the last three years with a South Bronx developer to bring art to life to low-income buildings and affordable housing.
It ' s called Rue des Prairies -- Prairie Street.
And I wanted to give them an escape.
And along the way , I ' m kind of making papercuttings and adding other techniques.
I don ' t know the stories.
And in all these universes , it ' s like imagination is the vehicle to be transported with , but the destination is our minds and how we can reconnect with the essential and with the magic.
culture,extreme sports,sports,success
And I started grappling with this existential angst of what little I had done with my life.
And I couldn ' t forgive myself for the countless , countless hours I had lost in negative thought -- all the time I had spent beating myself up for losing my marriage and not stopping the sexual abuse when I was a kid and career moves and this and this and this.
What am I going to do with this short amount of time that ' s just fleeting ? 
It was deep in my imagination.
It ' s probably , at my speed , at my age -- for anybody ' s speed at anybody ' s age -- going to take 60 , maybe 70 , hours of continuous swimming , never getting out on the boat.
As a matter of fact , this picture is supposed to be me during training.
As I said , I respect other sports , and I compare this sport sometimes to cycling and to mountain climbing and other of the expedition type events , but this is a sensory deprivation , a physical duress.
I say ,  " No , it ' s got to be 15 hours, "  and I swim another minute out and another minute back to make the 15 hours.
Try going in with an armada like we had of 50 people and five boats and CNN ' s crew , etc.
It ' s tricky.
And there are all kinds of problems.
And they were . They were prepared.
You ' ve got tight bathing caps over your ears trying to keep the heat of the head , because it ' s where the hypothermia starts , and so you don ' t hear very well.
And I had songs , I had a playlist in my head -- not through headphones , in my own head -- of 65 songs.
But no , for some reason I couldn ' t wait to get into the dark of the night and be singing , ♫  " A heard you knocking at my cellar door ♫ ♫ I love you baby and I want some more ♫ ♫ Ooh , ooh , the damage done "  ♫ The night before I started , I finished Stephen Hawking ' s  " The Grand Design. " 
Is this an envelope we ' re living inside of , or no , does it go onto infinity in both time and space ? 
And when I jumped into that water , I yelled in my mother ' s French ,  " Courage! " 
First of all , you ' re going to hit obstacles.
You ' re immersed in the liquid.
I knew there were Portuguese men o '  war , all kinds of moon jellies , all kinds of things , but the box jellyfish from the southern oceans is not supposed to be in these waters.
The most venomous animal that lives in the ocean is the box jellyfish.
Help me! Somebody help me! " 
Then come convulsions.
He ' s 29 years old , very well-built , lean , he ' s six-foot , five , weighs 265 lbs. , and he is down.
I need help , and I can ' t help Diana. " 
I didn ' t get out , but was in the water taking prednisone shots , taking Xanax , oxygen to the face.
And I swam through the night and I swam through the next day.
And I gave in to the staged swim.
And at 41 hours , this body couldn ' t make it.
And I knew about the jellyfish , but I was sort of cavalier.
We ' ve got benadryl on board . If I get stung , I ' ll just grin and bear it.
And they have these long 30 to 40 to 50-ft . tentacles.
And I said ,  " What ' s your name ?  "   " Henry. " 
And I said ,  " Well it ' s odd that you ' ve learned of this as a noble kind of pursuit , but yeah , I know those guys. " 
I said ,  " Oh , it ' s like a suicide army. " 
I finished the swim like this.
I wouldn ' t mind if every one of you came up on this stage tonight and told us how you ' ve gotten over the big disappointments of your lives.
And I can look at the journey , not just the destination.
And with all sincerity , I can say , I am glad I lived those two years of my life that way , because my goal to not suffer regrets anymore , I got there with that goal.
But that ocean ' s still there.
And so , what after that ? 
But I ' m ready.
And now I ' m going to live to 85.
http://www.ted.com/talks/alain_de_botton_a_kinder_gentler_philosophy_of_success.html
Alain de Botton : A kinder , gentler philosophy of success
It ' s perhaps easier now than ever before to make a good living.
One of the reasons why we might be suffering is that we are surrounded by snobs.
imagine that snobbery is a distinctively U.K . phenomenon fixated on country houses and titles.
It exists . What is a snob ? 
You encounter it within minutes at a party , when you get asked that famous iconic question of the early 21st century ,  " What do you do ?  " 
But unfortunately , most people are not our mothers.
I don ' t think we are particularly materialistic.
The next time you see somebody driving a Ferrari don ' t think ,  " This is somebody who is greedy. " 
One of these , and it ' s paradoxical because it ' s linked to something that ' s rather nice , is the hope we all have for our careers.
We are now in a system where anyone can rise to any position they please.
There is one really big problem with this , and that problem is envy.
Even though she is much richer than any of you are.
We can ' t relate to her . She speaks in a funny way.
But the problem , generally , of modern society , is that it turns the whole world into a school . Everybody is wearing jeans , everybody is the same.
It ' s probably as unlikely that you would nowadays become as rich and famous as Bill Gates , as it was unlikely in the 17th century that you would accede to the ranks of the French aristocracy.
When you go to a large bookshop and look at the self-help sections , as I sometimes do , if you analyze self-help books that are produced in the world today , there are basically two kinds.
So that ' s another way in which something that is quite positive can have a nasty kickback.
In other words , what is a meritocratic society ? 
And that makes failure seem much more crushing.
It ' s no longer the gods , it ' s us . We ' re in the driving seat.
And some of the reason for that is that people take what happens to them extremely personally.
Let ' s take meritocracy.
But I think it ' s insane to believe that we will ever make a society that is genuinely meritocratic . It ' s an impossible dream.
I ' m drawn to a lovely quote by St . Augustine in  " The City of God, "  where he says ,  " It ' s a sin to judge any man by his post. " 
And he ' s going to do that on the Day of Judgment with angels and trumpets , and the skies will open.
You don ' t necessarily know what someone ' s true value is.
When we think about failing in life , when we think about failure , one of the reasons why we fear failing is not just a loss of income , a loss of status.
They ' ve slept with the wrong person . They ' ve taken the wrong substance.
Now is there any alternative to this ? 
I went to talk to them about certain of the great tragedies of Western art.
They came up with  " Love-Crazed Immigrant Kills Senator ' s Daughter "  splashed across the headline.
And then my favorite.
It would be insane to call Hamlet a loser.
We are the first society to be living in a world where we don ' t worship anything other than ourselves.
Our heroes are human heroes.
Not for the sake of our health , though it ' s often presented that way , but because it ' s an escape from the human anthill.
What I think I ' ve been talking about really is success and failure.
My own theory of success -- and I ' m somebody who is very interested in success . I really want to be successful.
You can ' t be successful at everything.
I think any wise life will accept , as I say , that there is going to be an element where we are not succeeding.
No one is quite listening hard enough , but I very much believe that that ' s true.
When banking is no longer so respectable , we lose interest in banking.
and make sure that we own them , that we are truly the authors of our own ambitions.
But let ' s accept the strangeness of some of our ideas.
Chris Anderson : That was fascinating . How do you reconcile this idea of someone being -- it being bad to think of someone as a loser with the idea , that a lot of people like , of seizing control of your life.
Now I am a firm believer in justice , I just think that it is impossible.
Because otherwise it can get quite claustrophobic.
AB : The nightmare thought is that frightening people is the best way to get work out of them , and that somehow the crueler the environment the more people will rise to the challenge.
We need fathers , as it were , the exemplary father figures in society , avoiding the two extremes , which is the authoritarian , disciplinarian , on the one hand , and on the other , the lax , no rules option.
Eric Topol says we ' ll soon use our smartphones to monitor our vital signs and chronic conditions . At TEDMED , he highlights several of the most important wireless devices in medicine ' s future -- all helping to keep more of us out of hospital beds.
Does anybody know when the stethoscope was invented ? 
What has changed our society has been wireless devices.
And , as a cardiologist , to think that you could see in real time a patient , an individual , anywhere in the world on your smartphone , watching your rhythm -- that ' s incredible , and it ' s with us today.
This is already available today.
And then as we go further , today we have continuous glucose sensors.
We ' re going to zoom in on that a little bit.
The REM sleep , rapid eye movement , dream state , is in light green ; and light is gray , light sleep ; and deep sleep , the best restorative sleep , is that dark green.
But what I want to get to , the next frontier , very quickly , and why the stethoscope is on its way out , is because we can transcend listening to the valve sounds , and the breath sounds , because now , introduced by G.E . is a handheld ultra-sound.
Now , this is an example of another obsolete technology , soon to be buried : the Holter Monitor.
Now , how does this work ?  Well , there is these smart Band-Aids or these sensors that one would put on , on a shoe or on the wrist.
So , that ' s basically very simplistic technology of how this works.
This is me now . And you can see the ECG.
So , this is really striking , because this device measures seven things that are very much vital signs for monitoring someone with heart failure . OK ? 
The cost of heart failure is 37 billion dollars a year , which is 80 percent related to hospitalization.
What we have is , in a way , a perfect positive storm.
And this Wired Magazine cover article really captured a lot of this ; it talked a lot about the Nike shoe and how quickly that ' s been adopted to monitor exercise physiology and energy expenditure.
A lot of you have gotten that Phillips Direct Life.
And I want to just give you the results of that testing , because I wanted to understand about the consumer movement.
The only thing it really tracks by itself is activity , and even then , it ' s not complete.
And so I went to this , and of course I was gratified that it picked up the 42 minutes of exercise , elliptical exercise I did , but then it wants more information.
Furthermore it says ,  " Start time. " 
This is the headband that goes with this alarm clock.
Of course how many here have any problems with sleeping ? 
So this is the moment-by-moment , or minute-by-minute sleep.
Because it not only helps you with quantifying your sleep , but also tells others you ' re awake.
This thing is very , very impressive.
This was really fascinating because this gave that quantitation about all the different phases of sleep.
Look at this thing and say ,  " Well , I didn ' t think I was a very good sleeper , but actually I did better than average in 50 to 60 year olds. "  OK ? 
Now , diabetes is one of the big ones.
But of course we have a way to measure that now on a continuous basis , with a sensor that detects blood glucose , and it ' s important because we could detect hyperglycemia that otherwise wouldn ' t be known , and also hypoglycemia.
So , let me just give you , very quickly , 10 top targets for wireless medicine.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
And sleep disorders.
Aging : The problem is enormous , 300,000 broken hips per year ; but the solutions are extraordinary , and they include so many different things.
There are two things that can really accelerate this whole process.
There ' s over 650 wireless companies , 100 of which or more are working in wireless health.
And what it ' s trying to do is accelerate this era : to take unmet medical needs , to work and innovate -- and we just appointed the chief engineer , Mehran Mehregany , it was announced on Monday -- then to move up with development , clinical trial validation and then changing medical practice , the most challenging thing of all , requiring attention to reimbursement , healthcare policy , healthcare economics.
Over 80 major diseases have been cracked at the genomic level , but this is quite extraordinary : More has been learned about the underpinnings of disease in the last two and a half years than in the history of man.
We can also know who ' s likely to get atrial fibrillation.
We can prevent , or have the earliest detection possible , for breast cancer with an ultrasound device given to the patient.
So , I hope I ' ve convinced you of this , of the impact on hospital clinic resources is profound and then the impact on diseases is equally impressive across all these different diseases and more.
Listen closely -- Marvin Minsky ' s arch , eclectic , charmingly offhand talk on health , overpopulation and the human mind is packed with subtlety : wit , wisdom and just an ounce of wily , is-he-joking ?  advice.
If you ask people about what part of psychology do they think is hard , and you say ,  " Well , what about thinking and emotions ?  " 
But that ' s not the hard part. " 
And there was a little study about people who don ' t handshake , and comparing them with ones who do handshake.
So if you really want to solve the problem of epidemics and so forth , let ' s start with that . And since I got that idea , I ' ve had to shake hundreds of hands.
And then , of course , you have to do something about how to moderate that , so that anybody can -- so they ' ll listen to you.
Anyway , the question I think people should talk about -- and it ' s absolutely taboo -- is , how many people should there be ? 
Or you throw it into the ocean and some fish will benefit from it.
That would solve the problem , but I don ' t see anybody doing any research on making people smaller.
Wouldn ' t that be enough ?  And then the children would get plenty of support , and nurturing , and mentoring , and the world population would decline very rapidly and everybody would be totally happy.
And Arthur was looking at this old book , and he said ,  " Well , that was wrong.
A person comes out , they live for a thousand years doing whatever they do , and then , when it ' s time to go back for a billion years -- or a million , I forget , the numbers don ' t matter -- but there really aren ' t very many people on Earth at a time.
I don ' t think the solutions that I proposed are good enough or smart enough.
Well , what are we going to do about that ?  We could get smarter.
You see , there ' s two forks in the road . We know that people live twice as long as chimpanzees almost , and nobody lives more than 120 years , for reasons that aren ' t very well understood.
And as I said , we don ' t know how hard that is . It might be -- after all , most other mammals live half as long as the chimpanzee , so we ' re sort of three and a half or four times , have four times the longevity of most mammals . And in the case of the primates , we have almost the same genes . We only differ from chimpanzees , in the present state of knowledge , which is absolute hogwash , maybe by just a few hundred genes.
And so it might be that if we just fix four or five genes , we can live 200 years.
And , of course , we ' re not responsible for the consequences of what we ' re doing now , are we ?  Like all this complaint about clones.
And so there won ' t be any workforce.
Nobody knows how most of them work in detail , but we do know that there ' re lots of different things in there.
And when you ' re hungry , food becomes more attractive , and so forth.
And I guess I better skip all the rest of this , which are some details on how we might make those smart machines and -- -- and the main idea is in fact that the core of a really smart machine is one that recognizes that a certain kind of problem is facing you.
Saying , not what are the situations , but what are the kinds of problems and what are the kinds of strategies , how do you learn them , how do you connect them up , how does a really creative person invent a new way of thinking out of the available resources and so forth.
http://www.ted.com/talks/nathan_myhrvold_cut_your_food_in_half.html
Nathan Myhrvold : Cooking as never seen before
I went to chef school in France.
But there ' s some things that have been going on since this idea of food was established.
There ' s also a tremendous number of techniques that chefs have developed , some about new aesthetics , new approaches to food.
None of the techniques that these people have developed over the course of the last 20 years is in any of those books.
And so a few years ago -- fours years ago , actually -- I set out to say , is there a way we can communicate science and technique and wonder ? 
This is actually the first picture I took in the book.
And the hope was two-fold.
Steaming ought to be faster.
We discovered why woks are the shape they are.
Once you start cutting things in half , you kind of get carried away , so you see we cut the jars in half as well as the pan.
So this is great for pickled vegetables , which is what we ' re canning here.
And if you do lavish as much technique as possible , and you try to make the highest quality hamburger , it gets to be a little bit involved.
Most of the time is kind of sitting there.
Mostly it comes from fat pyrolyzing , or burning.
And the answer is : no , not really ; we use a machine shop.
The manufacturer said ,  " What would it take for you to cut one in half ?  " 
We would glue a piece of Pyrex or heat-resistant glass in front.
So it ' s very much like in a Hollywood movie where a guy flies through the air , supported by wires , and then they take the wires away digitally so you ' re flying through the air.
But again , it only has to work for a thousandth of a second.
But hey , they grow back.
We have the only cookbook in the world that has partial differential equations in it.
But you probably don ' t know that much about James Watt.
We also did a lot of calculation.
As you move side to side , it moves off.
And it ' s got this funny horn-shaped thing , which as far as I know , again , the first cookbook to ever do this.
Here ' s a step-by-step that shows grinding hamburger.
Here ' s the final hamburger.
We also have things about how to make the bun.
Isn ' t that beautiful ? 
So it ' s a great illustration of that.
Well , if you have a high-speed camera , and you have a block of ballistics gelatin lying around , pretty soon somebody does this.
Here it is.

Catherine Mohr : Surgery ' s past , present and robotic future
But you need to talk about surgical instruments and the evolution of surgical technology together.
And trephination is simply just cutting a hole in the skull.
And you have some guy that you ' re not quite sure what ' s wrong with him -- Oliver Sacks is going to be born way in the future.
Now that is surgical thinking.
And so what we are seeing is evidence of a refined technique that was being handed down over thousands and thousands of years , all over the world.
And we see new refined tools coming out.
This persisted all the way into and through the Renaissance.
These were folks that traveled from village to village , town to town , doing surgery sort of as a form of performance art.
And so here you see him doing a lithotomy.
With the demonstration of the Morton Ether Inhaler at the Mass . General in 1847 , a whole new era of surgery was ushered in.
But there was a pretty big problem with this.
And infection would continue to claim a majority of surgical patients until the next big revolution in surgery , which was aseptic technique.
And they came back to their American clinic and they said they had learned it was as important to wash your hands before doing surgery as it was to wash up afterwards.
With the patient insensitive to pain , and a sterile operating field all bets were off , the sky was the limit.
The era of the  " big surgeon , big incision "  had arrived , but at quite a cost , because they are saving lives , but not necessarily quality of life , because healthy people don ' t usually need surgery , and unhealthy people have a very hard time recovering from a cut like that.
Some of the tools for this had been around for a hundred years , but it had only been used as a diagnostic technique until the 1980s , when there was changes in camera technologies and things like that , that allowed this to be done for real operations.
Within 10 years of the first gallbladder surgeries being done laparoscopically , a majority of gallbladder surgeries were being done laparoscopically -- truly a pretty big revolution.
And during that learning curve the complications went quite a bit higher.
This surgeon has over 3,000 hours of laparoscopic experience.
You ' ve got these long instruments , and you ' re working off your centerline.
And so here you ' re seeing the operation of this wrist.
The surgeon is sitting at a console , and controlling the robot with these controllers.
You can also sew bypass vessels directly onto a beating heart without cracking the chest.
So , smartypants , why isn ' t all surgery being done this way ?  " 
With all its bells and whistles , one of those robots will cost you about as much as a solid gold surgeon.
So something like a prostatectomy -- the prostate is small , and it ' s in one spot , and you can set your robot up very precisely to work in that one spot.
And you need to put some new incisions in there.
And for that reason there are many surgeries that just aren ' t being done with the da Vinci.
How would that change the capabilities of the surgeon ? 
So what ' s going to come out of that tube is the debut of this new technology , this new robot that is going to be able to reach anywhere.
It has to be able to come off of the centerline and then be able to work back toward that centerline.
It ' s not so simple.
We get to write the script of the next revolution in surgery.
We need to be able to guide what we ' re cutting in a much better way.
It will go , bind to the cancer.
We can take these markers and we can inject them in a tumor site.
And we don ' t even need to confine ourselves to this macro vision.
So this is all very prototypey at this point.
We can heal the disease.
Many of you , all of you maybe , will at some point , or have already , faced a diagnosis of cancer , or heart disease , or some organ dysfunction that ' s going to buy you a date with a surgeon.
is that going to make that diagnosis any less terrifying ? 
What I want instead , is for you to be whole , intact , and functional enough to go out and save the world , after you ' ve decided you need to do it.
Slavery,business,economics,global issues,humanity,trafficking
It was the early  ' 90s , and I was at a public event.
Because I also , I ' m going to admit to you , I also thought ,  " How can I be like a hot-shot young full professor who teaches human rights and not know this ? 
Two turned out to be about contemporary -- only two.
I went to five countries around the world.
And I ' ve got to tell you , what I found out in the world in four different continents , was depressingly familiar.
I ' m talking about real slavery.
Now , where is it ? 
We ' re also particularly interested and looking very carefully at places where slaves are being used to perpetrate extreme environmental destruction.
That ' s double the number that came out of Africa in the entire transatlantic slave trade.
Being numerous does not make you a slave.
What it takes to turn a person who is destitute and vulnerable into a slave , is the absence of the rule of law.
Though , for a lot of people , the people who step into slavery today don ' t usually get kidnapped or knocked over the head.
They said ,  " That guy looked sketchy . I was suspicious , but my children were hungry.
Ten miles , 100 miles , 1,000 miles later , they find themselves in dirty , dangerous , demeaning work.
Even the business programs have started picking up on this.
And we ' re also joined by Brent Lawson from Lawson Frisk Securities.
BL : Well Daphne , we ' ve been going short on gas and oil recently and casting our net just a little bit wider.
D : Michael , what ' s your take on the people story ?  Are you interested ? 
That is that private equity has been sniffing around , and that tells me that this market is about to explode.
There ' s no need to play the market.
Though I enjoyed watching your jaws drop , drop , drop , until you got it.
Capital purchase items.
Slaves cost between 3,000 to 8,000 dollars in North America , but I could take you places in India or Nepal where human beings can be acquired for five or 10 dollars.
They are basically the transport system on a quarry run by a slaveholder.
And if there is anything that makes me feel very positive about this , it ' s that there are also -- in addition to young men like this who are still enslaved -- there are ex-slaves who are now working to free others.
I ' ve got to say , one of the most exciting parts about my job is that I get to , and I want to introduce you to one of those.
KB : James and our country director in Ghana , Emmanuel Otoo are now receiving regular death threats because the two of them managed to get convictions and imprisonment for three human traffickers for the very first time in Ghana for enslaving people , from the fishing industry , for enslaving children.
Slavery , illegal in every country has been pushed to the edges of our global society.
Well , first , before I even tell you the cost I ' ve got to be absolutely clear.
Liberation , and more importantly all the work that comes after liberation.
A boy in Ghana rescued from fishing slavery , about 400 dollars.
And in fact , the global average is about what it is for Ghana.
In fact , it ' s peanuts.
That ' s important , all of that about how we rebuild sustainable freedom , because we ' d never want to repeat what happened in this country in 1865.
We have made a commitment that we will never let people come out of slavery on our watch , and end up as second class citizens.
Now , this woman lived in a village in Nepal.
But when we went to speak with her , when we took this photograph , the slaveholders were still menacing us from the sidelines . They hadn ' t been really pushed back.
How could we not succeed, "  she said ,  " when people like you from the other side of the world are coming here to stand beside us ?  " 
And if there is a fundamental violation of our human dignity that we would all say is horrific , it ' s slavery.
Okay , thank you so much.

And they were a lot of fun.
Here ' s Charles when he was three . So he would be 100 this June.
The whole thing about this , though , is that , you know , why am I showing it ? 
There is a picture of Charles . So let ' s watch the next clip.
It is rough and it is flat.
But people live on this land.
It was on seven screens and it was 200 feet across.
You know , commonality , the first line in Charles '  narration was ,  " The same stars that shine down on Russia shine down on the United States . From the sky , our cities look much the same. " 
But the thing about Charles and Ray is that they were always modeling stuff.
I ' m no exception.
And this is a model that they did of that seven-screen presentation.
So what we ' re going to see is some of the icons of Eames furniture.
It ' s just the things you try out to kind of make it work better.
And I think that ' s one of the commonalities between modernism and traditional design . I think it may be a real common ground as we kind of figure out what on earth to do in the next 20 or 30 years.
It ' s a pivot between a process and a system.
Because it ' s like as Bill Clinton was saying about Rwandan health clinics.
Because it just kind of , you know , doesn ' t get any more basic than that.
Charles and Ray liked this one because it was better.
And they ' d been working on furniture before.
My sister is chasing someone else . It ' s not me.
The house is 1949.
They didn ' t say ,  " Our style is grids . Let ' s make the chair griddy. " 
It ' s kind of a brutal quote.
The  " Powers of Ten "  is a film they made.
And a lamp that Charles designed for a church.
ED : You ' ve seen that film , and what ' s so great about this whole conference is that everybody has been talking about scale.
So here is the tiny creature.
And I think in our family we were very lucky , because we learned about design backwards.
And here is some family pictures.
This is a film , the one called Toys.
Lower left is Day-of-the-Dead toys.
And now I ' m going to test you.
Audience : Saw many trains.
Dawn , very good.
Citizen Kane , rose -- Audience : Rosebud.
I hope you had a nice time at Buddy ' s party. " 
These are some images from a project of mine that ' s called Kymaerica.
We ' re about to do six in the U.K . next week.
And so we had spelling bees in Paris , Illinois.
So you can actually visit and have this three-dimensional fictional experience there.
Other things could have happened . The Japanese could have discovered Monterey.
And you ' re kind of trapped in the texture of Kymaerica.
And this is Cranbrook . I ' ve got a real treat for you , which is the first film that Charles ever made.
And he made it for the 1939 faculty exhibition.
And you try something out.
So my point is that this scope of vision , this holistic vision of design , was with them from the beginning.
And I think that all of us in this room , as you move design forward , it ' s not about just doing one thing.
So this is Charles '  voice.
If you ' re up the scale a little bit more , why , a brass thali.
And I suppose some nut has had a gold thali that he ' s eaten off of.
But it is that process that has happened within the man that changes the banana leaf.
 " Beyond the age of information is the age of choices. " 
And I think that this is all part of surrendering to the design journey.
I really thank you for your time.

Superconductivity is a quantum state of matter , and it occurs only below a certain critical temperature.
The first is zero electrical resistance , and the second is the expulsion of a magnetic field from the interior of the superconductor.
And these electrons , while flowing , they collide with the atoms , and in these collisions they lose a certain amount of energy.
In classical physics , there is always some friction , some energy loss.
Now , the combination of both effects -- the expulsion of magnetic fields and zero electrical resistance -- is exactly a superconductor.
Why ?  Because it is a quantum phenomenon . It ' s quantum physics.
So , this is why we call this effect quantum levitation and quantum locking.
And by doing that , what it actually does is locking itself in place.
And when I place it on top of a regular magnet , it just stays locked in midair.
So , this is quantum locking -- actually locking -- three-dimensional locking of the superconductor.
Why ?  Because as long as it rotates , the locking is maintained.
But how many fluxons , how many magnetic strands are there in a single disk like this ? 
And , yeah , the amazing part is that this superconductor that you see here is only half a micron thick . It ' s extremely thin.
For example , I can make a large circular rail here.
I can take this disk and put it here , and while it stays here -- don ' t move -- I will try to rotate the track , and hopefully , if I did it correctly , it stays suspended.
But we can also store energy using superconductors , because we have no dissipation.
Well , let me answer this simple question by giving you an example.
Amazing . Thank you.

They look like TV cameras , monitors , annoying radio mics.
And he kind of assumes that , yes , he ' ll become -- these villagers -- he ' ll become their emperor and transform their society with his wonderful command of technology and science and the elements , but , of course , realizes that without the rest of human society , he can barely make a sandwich , let alone a toaster.
I didn ' t have the rest of my life to do this project.
So , starting with steel : how do you make steel ? 
And said ,  " Hi , I ' m trying to make a toaster.
But after some nagging , I got him to do that.
And of course , it wasn ' t actually a working mine anymore , because , though Ray was a miner there , the mine had closed and had been reopened as a kind of tourist attraction , because , of course , it can ' t compete on the scale of operations which are happening in South America , Australia , wherever.
Because , of course , they don ' t actually tell you how to do it if you want to do it yourself and you don ' t have a smelting plant.
But instead of a bellows , I had a leaf blower.
But luckily , I found a patent online for industrial furnaces that use microwaves , and at 30 minutes at full power , and I was able to finish off the process.
And the reason I was interested in getting water is because water which goes through mines becomes kind of acidic and will start picking up , dissolving the minerals from the mine.
But anyway , the water I dragged back from the Isle of Anglesey where the mine was -- there was enough copper in it such that I could cast the pins of my metal electric plug.
And the last material I ' m going to talk about today is plastic , and , of course , my toaster had to have a plastic case.
But even then they weren ' t convinced and said ,  " Okay , we ' ll phone you back "  -- never did.
And for a while that was looking really good.
And geologists have actually christened -- well , they ' re debating whether to christen -- the age that we ' re living in -- they ' re debating whether to make it a new geological epoch called the Anthropocene , the age of Man.
And also , I thought that there would be synthetic polymers , plastics , embedded in the rock.
And that was brought into force to try and deal with the mountain of stuff that is just being made and then living for a while in our homes and then going to landfill.
And there it is on the shelves.
Kew Gardens were insistent that I couldn ' t come and hack into their rubber tree.
But I considered it a partial success , to be honest.

It ' s not linear . And our intuition is linear.
There is a big difference between linear and exponential growth.
And that really describes information technology.
And we ' re going to do it again in the next 25 years.
We ' ll then go to the next paradigm.
It ' s really any technology where we can measure the underlying information properties.
And that was the end of the shrinking of vacuum tubes , but it was not the end of the exponential growth of computing.
I mean this went through thick and thin , through war and peace , through boom times and recessions.
And I just updated these graphs.
Maybe it kind of didn ' t stay on this exponential progression. " 
But look at how predictable this is.
That ' s a 50 percent deflation rate.
We ' ve had 18 percent growth in constant dollars in every form of information technology for the last half-century , despite the fact that you can get twice as much of it each year.
The cost has come down by half every year.
Because if you double one percent seven more times , which is exactly what happened , you get 100 percent . And the project was finished on time.
I wrote , over 20 years ago in  " The Age of Intelligent Machines, "  when the Soviet Union was going strong , that it would be swept away by this growth of decentralized communication.
But we are learning more and more about the human brain.
There is about 20 regions of the brain that have been modeled , simulated and tested : the auditory cortex , regions of the visual cortex ; cerebellum , where we do our skill formation ; slices of the cerebral cortex , where we do our rational thinking.
Well this is a logarithmic graph.
We ultimately will merge with this technology . It ' s already very close to us.
And we will begin to actually deeply influence our health and our intelligence , as we get closer and closer to this technology.
And our goal was to assemble the leaders , both teachers and students , in these exponentially growing information technologies , and their application.
The last third of the nine-week intensive summer session will be devoted to a group project to address some major challenge of humanity.
Here is our founding meeting.
The first six tracks here -- artificial intelligence , advanced computing technologies , biotechnology , nanotechnology -- are the different core areas of information technology.
And we invite you to participate . Thank you very much.

The tracks are elevated about eight feet from the waterline normally , but at that point the water had receded to a level three or four feet below normal.
They were trying to catch fish.
Then someone on the tracks screamed.
No one was lost there . But the water continued to climb.
He said he ' d lived his whole life there by the beach , and that he would rather die there than run.
Since this was a high-risk location , the police had warned the residents , and no one was there when the water rose.
This may seem hard to believe -- unless you ' ve been reading lots and lots of news reports -- but in many places , after the tsunami , villagers were still terrified.
You don ' t even know if it is safe to go back down to the water , to catch a boat to the hospital.
At the Phi Phi Hill Resort , I was tucked into the corner furthest away from the television , but I strained to listen for information.
In general , everything was merely hearsay and rumor , and not a single person I spoke to for over 36 hours knew anything with any certainty.
One from Thailand , and the second one from Phuket as well.
Voice 2 : Come get inside here.
James Surowiecki : Phew . Those were both on this site : waveofdestruction.org.
And what you had was a group of essentially unorganized , unconnected writers , video bloggers , etc. , who were able to come up with a collective portrait of a disaster that gave us a much better sense of what it was like to actually be there than the mainstream media could give us.
And I want to ask three questions in this talk , in the 10 minutes that remain , about the blogosphere.
OK , the first question : What do they tell us about why people do things ? 
But instead , what we ' re finding on the Internet -- and one of the great geniuses of it -- is that people have found a way to work together without any money involved at all.
That ' s a very powerful idea , and it ' s a very powerful reality.
So , Howard Rheingold has written a lot about this and , I think , is writing about this more , but this notion of voluntary cooperation is an incredibly powerful one , and one worth thinking about.
And they can actually often be smarter than even the smartest person within them.
There may be one or two of you who are brilliant jelly bean guessers , but for the most part the group ' s guess would be better than just about all of you.
You know , if you think about something like Google , which essentially is relying on the collective intelligence of the Web to seek out those sites that have the most valuable information -- we know that Google does an exceptionally good job of doing that , and it does that because , collectively , this disorganized thing we call the  " World Wide Web "  actually has a remarkable order , or a remarkable intelligence in it.
But what the blogosphere offers is the possibility of getting at the kind of collective , distributive intelligence that is out there , and that we know is available to us if we can just figure out a way of accessing it.
But there is a dark side to this , and that ' s what I want to spend the last part of my talk on.
And much of the time it is.
A network is not just the product of its component parts.
But the problem is that groups are only smart when the people in them are as independent as possible.
People have linked to it , and so other people in turn link to it , etc. , etc.
You know , this is a conference inspired by nature.
But we know that occasionally ants go astray , and what happens is that , if army ants are wandering around and they get lost , they start to follow a simple rule -- just do what the ant in front of you does.
That ' s the thing we have to fear -- is that we ' re just going to keep marching around and around until we die.
There , you really did see the intelligence of the Web manifest itself.
Inventor Dean Kamen previews the prosthetic arm he’s developing at the request of the US Department of Defense . His quiet commitment to using technology to solve problems -- while honoring the human spirit -- has never been more clear.
I got a visit almost exactly a year ago , a little over a year ago , from a very senior person at the Department of Defense.
And they deserve more than that. " 
I said ,  " Look , you ' re nuts . That technology ' s just not available right now.
You think it ' s bad to lose one arm ? 
He says to me ,  " We ' ve done some work around the country.
I went down to Washington . I saw these guys , and said ,  " I did what you asked me . I looked at what ' s out there.
We have 14 out of the 21 degrees of freedom ; you don ' t need the ones in the last two fingers.
One guy who described himself as being lucky , because he lost his left arm , and he ' s a righty.
So I ' m going to show you now , without the skin on it , a 30-second piece , and then I ' m done.
It also has a pneumatic cuff that holds it on , so the more they put themselves under load , the more it attaches.
This weighs 6.9 pounds.
Now he ' s going to put that down , pick up a piece of paper , rotate all the degrees of freedom in his hand and wrist , and read it.

So what ' s a technology that will allow us to make ginormous houses ? 
We use CNC to make scaffolding to train semi-epithetic matter , plants , into a specific geometry that makes a home that we call a Fab Tree Hab.
They ' re perfect.
So we ' ve been doing this for a couple of years , and that ' s our lab.
It ' s victimless . It ' s meat from a test tube.
It could have been an English Tudor or Spanish Colonial , but we kind of chose this shape.

Sherwin Nuland on hope
This is my third visit to TED.
It ' s : This is what I have done because I ' m excited by it , because it ' s a wonderful thing , and it ' s done something for me and , of course , it ' s accomplished a great deal.
And hope , of course , is the topic that I ' m supposed to be speaking about , which I ' d completely forgotten about until I arrived.
Well , it reminds me a little bit of surgery.
If you have appendicitis , they take your appendix out , and you ' re cured.
The Indo-European root of the word hope is a stem , K-E-U -- we would spell it K-E-U ; it ' s pronounced koy -- and it is the same root from which the word curve comes from.
You ' ve heard that word several times in the last four days , and everyone ' s familiar with Kuhnian paradigms.
I wasn ' t sure I heard it right , so I found him in one of the inter-sessions.
So , here ' s what it is : I ' ll repeat it.
And by the human spirit , I don ' t mean anything divine , I don ' t mean anything supernatural -- certainly not coming from this skeptic.
We feel it at concerts.
And if there ' s anything that has permeated this room , it is precisely that.
And here ' s what he says , roughly translated : A man -- generic man -- a man , to be greatly good , must imagine clearly.
What is it that they have every right to ask of us ? 
There has certainly been no argument about that in this room in the past four days.
It comes initially from the Latin patior , to endure , or to suffer.
Of course , in this day and age , the trick is not to let each tree be obscured by that Bush in Washington that can get -- can get in the way.
Now , if we ' re talking about medicine , and we ' re talking about healing , I ' d like to quote someone who hasn ' t been quoted.
And I ' ll read you what it is.
http://www.ted.com/talks/daniel_wolpert_the_real_reason_for_brains.html
Daniel Wolpert : The real reason for brains
And that is , why do we and other animals have brains ? 
We have a brain for one reason and one reason only , and that ' s to produce adaptable and complex movements.
Now that ' s not quite true . There ' s one other way , and that ' s through sweating.
There can be no evolutionary advantage to laying down memories of childhood or perceiving the color of a rose if it doesn ' t affect the way you ' re going to move later in life.
And the first thing it does in implanting on that rock , which it never leaves , is to digest its own brain and nervous system for food.
I believe movement is the most important function of the brain -- don ' t let anyone tell you that it ' s not true.
Think about the game of chess.
That problem is solved.
Now why is that top problem so easy and the bottom problem so hard ? 
When it comes to being dexterous , it ' s not even clear what the algorithm is you have to solve to be dexterous.
So this is the end of a Ph.D . project from one of the best robotics institutes.
Now if you want this robot to do a different task , that ' s another three-year Ph.D . program.
Now the Americans in the audience will know all about cup stacking.
We have no idea what is going on inside her brain when she does that , and that ' s what we ' d like to know.
Your arm or body moves , and you get sensory feedback from vision , from skin , from muscles and so on.
We use it in the engineering and neuroscience sense meaning a random noise corrupting a signal.
Similarly , when you put motor output on movement output , it ' s extremely noisy.
The teapot could be full , it could be empty.
So if you ' re lucky enough to be able to knock a small white ball into a hole several hundred yards away using a long metal stick , our society will be willing to reward you with hundreds of millions of dollars.
And the fundamental idea is you want to make inferences and then take actions.
Beliefs could be : where are my arms in space ? 
And numbers in between give you the gray levels of uncertainty.
But there ' s another source of information , and that ' s effectively prior knowledge.
I ' m not going to explain what that formula is , but it ' s very beautiful.
Imagine you ' re learning to play tennis and you want to decide where the ball is going to bounce as it comes over the net towards you.
That information is available in the current shot , but there ' s another source of information not available on the current shot , but only available by repeated experience in the game of tennis , and that ' s that the ball doesn ' t bounce with equal probability over the court during the match.
So it ' s the optimal way of combining information.
Now a key part to the Bayesian is this part of the formula.
And moreover , it profoundly changes your perceptions by what you do.
And here ' s inside the brain.
And if I ' ve got a good predictor , it predicts the same thing.
Imagine , as I shake the ketchup bottle , someone very kindly comes up to me and taps it on the back for me.
Now there ' s good reason to believe that you would want to be able to distinguish external events from internal events.
So as I go around the world , I ' m making predictions of what I should get , subtracting them off.
And so we decided the most obvious place to start was with tickling.
And in effect , what we have is some sort of stick in one hand attached to a robot , and they ' re going to move that back and forward.
And here I ' ve taken away the robots , but basically people move with their right arm sinusoidally back and forward.
The left hand always is the same and puts sinusoidal tickle.
And by 0.2 of a second , it ' s equivalently ticklish to the robot that just tickled you without you doing anything.
Because the tickle sensation on the palm comes and goes , you need large numbers of subjects with these stars making them significant.
It quickly escalates.
And we hypothesize based on the tickling study that when one child hits another , they generate the movement command.
So if they retaliate with the same force , the first person will think it ' s been escalated.
And so here ' s player one and player two sitting opposite to each other.
And that player ' s been told , remember the experience of that force and use your other finger to apply the same force down to the other subject ' s finger through a force transfuser -- and they do that.
But critically , they ' re briefed about the rules of the game in separate rooms.
And what we see in all pairs of subjects is this -- a 70 percent escalation in force on each go.
And what Bayes '  rule says is , given my beliefs , the action should in some sense be optimal.
So it could be bridged in infinitely many different ways.
And I can hold my arm in a particular joint configuration either very stiff or very relaxed.
And so it turns out we ' re so stereotypical , our brains have got dedicated neural circuitry to decode this stereotyping.
If these dots were cars going on a racing circuit , you would have absolutely no idea what ' s going on.
Maybe there ' s variation in the population.
So what is it about a movement which is good or bad ? 
But there ' s noise added to this.
If I choose a different way of moving -- on the right for example -- then I ' ll have a different command , different noise , playing through a noisy system , very complicated.
And the fundamental idea is you want to plan your movements so as to minimize the negative consequence of the noise.
So I hope I ' ve convinced you the brain is there and evolved to control movement.
And hopefully if we understand how we control movement , we can apply that to robotic technology.
Does that mean that you think that the other things we think our brains are about -- the dreaming , the yearning , the falling in love and all these things -- are a kind of side show , an accident ? 
You only need to store things which are really going to effect movement.
And it uses it very differently once you think about it that way.

And the Dark Ages are the time between when you put away the Lego for the last time as a kid , and you decide as an adult that it is okay to play with a kid ' s toy.
Bought him this.
She ' s like ,  " Oh , us. "  I ' m like ,  " Okay . All right . That ' s cool. " 
So we took a room downstairs in the basement that had been used as sort of an Abu Ghraib annex.
My daughter -- the day we got it , I was tucking her in -- and I said ,  " Honey , you ' re my treasure. " 
I suppose we are. " 
So then you realize there are these conventions.
And then someone built this -- this is the Smith Tower in Seattle.
And at a certain point , you look around , you ' re like ,  " Whoa , this is a really nerdy crowd. " 
I ' m coming out.
And then whatever you design virtually , you click the button and it shows up at your doorstep a week later.
Then you notice that if that Lego-provided CAD program isn ' t enough , there ' s an entire open-source , third-party , independent Lego CAD program that lets you do 3D modeling and 3D rendering and make , in fact , movies out of Lego , 3D films of which there are thousands on YouTube , and some of them sort of mimicking famous films and some totally original content -- just beautiful -- and people recreating all sorts of things.
There ' s a whole programming language and robotics tool , so if you want to teach someone how to program , kid , adult , whatever it is.
There ' s people getting drunk building Lego , and you ' ve got to finish the thing before you puke.
This is amazing what you can do.
I was afraid a car was going to come smash it as I was taking a picture for you guys.
Let ' s see here.
At TEDxNASA , planetary scientist Joel Levine shows some intriguing -- and puzzling -- new discoveries about Mars : craters full of ice , traces of ancient oceans , and compelling hints at the presence , sometime in the past , of life . He makes the case for going back to Mars to find out more.
I want to talk about 4.6 billion years of history in 18 minutes.
It was taken in 1965.
One of the key questions in all of science ,  " Is there life outside of Earth ?  " 
This is a composite taken by Viking in 1976.
This is the first photograph taken from the surface of any planet.
So , Mars is a pretty big place even though it ' s half the size.
Mars has the Grand Canyon of the solar system , Valles Marineris.
If you happened to be on Mars when this impactor hit , it was a really bad day on Mars.
We ' re looking at Valles Marineris , the largest canyon in the solar system , superimposed on a map of the United States , 3,000 miles across.
Is there water on Mars ? 
We believe there ' s some water in the polar caps , there are polar caps of North Pole and South Pole.
Why is water important ?  Water is important because if you want life you have to have water.
This is ice water on Mars.
Very intriguing photograph.
Where did the ocean ' s worth of water on Mars go ? 
And this shows the percent . If it ' s a blueish color , it means 16 percent by weight.
And what we ' re looking at is the presence of the gas methane , CH4 , in the atmosphere of Mars.
We now have evidence that methane is in the atmosphere of Mars , a gas that , on Earth , is biogenic in origin , produced by living systems.
The oldest rock on Earth is only 3.6 billion.
And this terrain that we ' re looking at dates back to 4.6 billion years when Earth and Mars were formed.
This is Opportunity . This is Spirit.
There aren ' t many craters.
Here ' s Hellas Basin , a very very different place , geologically.
We invited 10 of the top Mars scientists to the Langley Research Center for two days.
It ' s an Aerial Regional-scale Environmental Surveyor.
If any place in the world can build an airplane to fly on Mars , it ' s the Langley Research Center , for almost 100 years a leading center of aeronautics in the world.
But , of equal importance , as we fly through the atmosphere of Mars , we transmit that journey , the first flight of an airplane outside of the Earth , we transmit those images back to Earth.
This is what ARES looks like as it flies over Mars.
We will look for methane as well as other gasses produced by living systems.
The problem is we don ' t fly it to Mars , we put it in a spacecraft and we send it to Mars.
And we have it in something called an aeroshell.
Joel Levine : This is a launch from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.
A parachute opens up to slow it down.
The rocket engine begins.
Because we have tested ARES model , several models in a half a dozen wind tunnels at the NASA Langley Research Center for eight years , under Mars conditions.
And I want to show you one of our tests.
We put the folded airplane on the balloon -- it took about three hours to get up there -- and then we released it on command at 103,000 feet , and we deploy the airplane and everything works perfectly.
But we have a full-scale model in storage at the NASA Langley Research Center.
This is the ARES team ; we have about 150 scientists , engineers ; where we ' re working with Jet Propulsion Laboratory , Goddard Space Flight Center , Ames Research Center and half a dozen major universities and corporations in developing this.
We are prepared to fly this on Mars , rewrite the textbook about Mars.

Probably by now most of you have seen Al Gore ' s amazing talk.
The conversation came to my 15-year-old daughter , Mary.
I didn ' t know what to say . Kleiner ' s second law is ,  " There is a time when panic is the appropriate response. " 
We went to Brazil . We went to China and to India , to Bentonville , Arkansas , to Washington , D.C . and to Sacramento.
For this climate crisis , we assembled a network , really , of superstars , from policy activists to scientists and entrepreneurs and business leaders . Fifty or so of them.
They committed that they ' re going to take their existing stores and reduce their energy consumption by 20 percent , and their new stores by 30 percent , and do all that in seven years.
They put smart skylights through their stores so they could harvest the daylight and reduce the lighting demands.
Why does Wal-Mart matter ?  Well , it ' s massive.
And they have one of the world ' s most amazing supply chains , 60,000 suppliers . If Wal-Mart were a country , it would be the sixth-largest trading partner with China.
We need Wal-Mart and every other company to do the same.
That ' s a third of the U.S . population.
The light ' s kind of funny , they won ' t dim , takes a while for them to start up.
It is stupid that we use two tons of steel , glass and plastic to haul our sorry selves to the shopping mall.
I don ' t know , and I should.
The third lesson we learned is that policy matters . It really matters.
And Bob Epstein raised a hand . He stood up.
So , eight of us went to Sacramento in August and we met with the seven undecided legislators and we lobbied for AB32.
Because California was the first state in this country to mandate 25 percent reduction of greenhouse gases by 2020.
In fact , I ' m certain California ' s not enough.
He ' s the father of the ethanol revolution.
And so , here ' s what ' s happened in Brazil.
So , what ' s happened in Brazil is , they ' ve replaced 40 percent of the gasoline consumed by their automotive fleet with ethanol.
But Brazil ' s only 1.3 percent of the world ' s CO2 emission.
So , I want to tell you about a tragic problem and a breakthrough technology.
So , a team of Berkeley researchers with 15 million dollars from the Gates Foundation is engineering , designing a radical new way to make the key ingredient , called artemisinin , and they ' re going to make that drug 10 times cheaper.
Now , what you do is , you get inside the microbe , you change its metabolic pathways , and you end up with a living chemical factory.
Don ' t let me skip over that . Better biofuels are a really big deal.
Alan Kay is famous for saying the best way to predict the future is to invent it.
We ' re talking a lot about this.
Do you know , they only invested 0.2 percent of revenues in R&D ? 
It is almost criminal that we are not investing more in energy research in this country.
Who would have thought that the ethanol biofuel miracle would come from a developing country in South America ? 
Not enough to keep the ice in Greenland from crashing into the ocean.
That ' s about as much CO2 as there is in the whole world.
Does anybody here have an answer for him ?  I don ' t.
Well , I ' ll tell you what . Green technologies -- going green -- is bigger than the Internet.
Everyone here cares about changing the world and has made a difference in that one way or another.
There ' s six bills right now in Congress . Let ' s get one of them passed.
Can you imagine what it would be like if Amazon or eBay or Google or Microsoft or Apple really went green and you caused that to happen ? 
Because if we do , I can look forward to the conversation I ' m going to have with my daughter in 20 years.
958
So , I form friendships and co-worker and sibling and relative relationships with other people who in turn have similar relationships with other people.
Every line between them is a relationship between two people -- different kinds of relationships.
So one of the first things we thought we would tackle would be how we go about predicting epidemics.
And actually , about a year or so ago , there was this promulgation of the idea of Google Flu Trends , with respect to the flu , where by looking at people ' s searching behavior today , we could know where the flu -- what the status of the epidemic was today , what ' s the prevalence of the epidemic today.
A kind of a diffusion of innovation could be understood and predicted by the mechanism I ' m going to show you now.
And the reason for this shape is that at the very beginning , let ' s say one or two people are infected , or affected by the thing and then they affect , or infect , two people , who in turn affect four , eight , 16 and so forth , and you get the epidemic growth phase of the curve.
But things don ' t just diffuse in human populations at random.
And the lines represent -- the dots are the people , and the lines represent friendship relationships.
And different sorts of things spread across different sorts of ties.
But not all positions in the network are the same.
But in addition , there ' s something else.
Nicholas Christakis : B , it ' s obvious.
A , in fact , is more central , and this can be formalized mathematically.
And in fact , if you could do that , what you would see is something like this.
And on the right-hand side , we show the same data , but here with daily incidence.
The problem , however , is that mapping human social networks is not always possible.
Your friends have more friends than you do , and this is known as the friendship paradox.
The friends of randomly chosen people have higher degree , and are more central than the random people themselves.
And in fact , it happens throughout the network as you move in , everyone you pick , when they nominate a random -- when a random person nominates a friend of theirs , you move closer to the center of the network.
We took 1,300 randomly selected undergraduates , we had them nominate their friends , and we followed both the random students and their friends daily in time to see whether or not they had the flu epidemic.
So the random group is in the red line.
Now , in addition to that , if you were an analyst who was trying to study an epidemic or to predict the adoption of a product , for example , what you could do is you could pick a random sample of the population , also have them nominate their friends and follow the friends and follow both the randoms and the friends.
And that , as indicated by the white line , occurred 46 days before the peak of the epidemic.
Now in our case , although it wasn ' t necessary , we could also actually map the network of the students.
The red dots are going to be cases of the flu , and the yellow dots are going to be friends of the people with the flu.
You ' re going to see kind of blooming of the flu in the middle.
And this type of a visualization can show that epidemics like this take root and affect central individuals first , before they affect others.
If I ' m likely to do something that affects others around me , this technique can get early warning or early detection about the adoption within the population.
So , for example , most of you are probably familiar with the notion of herd immunity.
They are surrounded by immunized people.
And the answer is no.
Or , frankly , for advertising with all kinds of products.
Every dot is a person , and every line represents a volume of calls between the people.
And in fact , we are in the era of what I would call  " massive-passive "  data collection efforts.
So , for example , we could use truckers '  purchases of fuel.
And they can feed that information back to their subscribers , but only to their subscribers on the same highway located behind the traffic jam!
One is fully passive , like I just described -- as in , for instance , the trucker example , where we don ' t actually intervene in the population in any way.
And collect vast amounts of information about people ' s temperature , but from centrally located individuals.
It ' s sort of like when Galileo invented -- or , didn ' t invent -- came to use a telescope and could see the heavens in a new way , or Leeuwenhoek became aware of the microscope -- or actually invented -- and could see biology in a new way.
http://www.ted.com/talks/ben_kacyra_ancient_wonders_captured_in_3d.html
Ben Kacyra : Ancient wonders captured in 3D
And the dad used to use those bulls to tell the boy stories about that civilization and their work.
The system measures the beam ' s time of flight , recording the time it takes for the light to hit a surface and make its return.
Ben Kacyra : You can see here , these systems are extremely fast.
So , as you can imagine , this was a paradigm shift in the survey and construction as well as in reality capture industry.
This clearly devastated me , and I couldn ' t help but wonder about the fate of my old friends , the winged bulls , and the fate of the many , many heritage sites all over the world.
Let me show you some of them : Chichen Itza , Rapa Nui -- and what you ' re seeing here are the cloud of points -- Babylon , Rosslyn Chapel , Pompeii , and our latest project , Mt . Rushmore , which happened to be one of our most challenging projects.
These would be used for education , cultural tourism , etc.
And here , this is a fly-through the cloud of points of Tikal , and here you see it rendered and photo-textured with the photography that we take of the site.
And here you ' re looking at a model that ' s extracted from the cloud of points for Stirling Castle.
Of course , earthquakes and all the natural phenomena -- floods , tornadoes , etc . -- take their toll.
We ' re losing our sites and the stories , and basically we ' re losing a piece -- and a significant piece -- of our collective memory.
Because of this accelerated pace of destruction , it became clear to us that we needed to challenge ourselves and our partners to accelerate our work.
In order to sustain our work into the future , we use technology centers where we partner with local universities and colleges to take the technology to them , whereby they then can help us with digital preservation of their heritage sites , and at the same time , it gives them the technology to benefit from in the future.
Last March , we received very sad news.
Let me leave you with a final thought.
The two wizards that I have that are behind the curtain will help me bring the results on the screen.
So you have been digitally preserved in about four minutes.
David.
Samantha Power tells a story of a complicated hero , Sergio Vieira de Mello . This UN diplomat walked a thin moral line , negotiating with the world ' s worst dictators to help their people survive crisis . It ' s a compelling story told with a fiery passion.
I spent the better part of a decade looking at American responses to mass atrocity and genocide.
On April 21 , in the New York Times , the paper reported that somewhere between 200,000 and 300,000 people had already been killed in the genocide.
But on April 21 , a wonderfully honest moment occurred.
Two to 300,000 people have just been exterminated in the last couple of weeks in Rwanda.
And she said -- she was so honest -- she said ,  " It ' s a great question.
And that truth is , or was , in the 20th century , that while we were beginning to develop endangered species movements , we didn ' t have an endangered people ' s movement.
I mean , we have owned Never Again culturally , appropriately , interestingly.
So that was the 20th century.
It ' s bigger than the anti-apartheid movement.
To call it a movement , as with all movements , perhaps , is a little misleading.
It sees itself , such as it is , the it , as something that will create the impression that there will be political cost , there will be a political price to be paid , for allowing genocide , for not having an heroic imagination , for not being an upstander but for being , in fact , a bystander.
It will refer you directly to your congressperson , to your U.S . senator , to your governor where divestment legislation is pending.
So what you now have when a Congress is in session is members of Congress calling up these 19-year-olds or 24-year-olds and saying , I ' m just told I have a D minus on genocide ; what do I do to get a C ?  I just want to get a C . Help me.
The expenditure of 3 billion dollars in refugee camps to try to keep , basically , the people who ' ve been displaced from their homes by the Sudanese government , by the so-called Janjaweed , the militia , to keep those people alive until something more durable can be achieved.
The people in those camps are surrounded on all sides by so-called Janjaweed , these men on horseback with spears and Kalashnikovs.
Why the limits to the movement ? 
It does not have too many compatriots abroad who themselves are asking their governments to do more to stop genocide.
So this movement , if it ' s to be durable and global , will have to cross borders , and you will have to see other citizens in democracies , not simply resting on the assumption that their government would do something in the face of genocide , but actually making it such.
So one reason is it hasn ' t gone global.
Let me be clear.
We have to ask ourselves , what now ?  What do we do going forward as a country and as citizens in relationship to the world ' s worst places , the world ' s worst suffering , killers , and the kinds of killers that could come home to roost sometime in the future ? 
Now , who was Sergio ?  Sergio Vieira de Mello was his name.
He was drawn to the flames , he chased the flames , he was like a moth to the flames . Something of an adrenalin junkie.
In failing states , genocidal states , under-governed states , precisely the kinds of places that threats to this country exist on the horizon , and precisely the kinds of places where most of the world ' s suffering tends to get concentrated.
Started off when the causes in the wars du jour in the  ' 70s were wars of independence and decolonization.
He was in Mozambique for the War of Independence.
People date the beginning of this new era to 9/11 , but surely 1983 , with the attack on the US Embassy and the Marine barracks -- which Sergio witnessed -- those are , in fact , in some ways , the dawning of the era that we find ourselves in today.
Talk about evil prevailing . I mean , here he was in the room with the embodiment of evil in Cambodia.
I ' m Sergio , I ' m a humanitarian , and I want to feed those -- well , I don ' t want to feed the killers but I want to feed the two million people who are with them , so we ' re going to go , we ' re going to set up camps , and we ' re going to supply humanitarian aid.
And their response , of course , was no more than we wanted to stop the genocide and put our troops in harm ' s way to do that , nor do we now want to get in the way and pluck genocidaires from camps.
What do you do ? 
He ' s the viceroy . He has to decide on tax policy , on currency , on border patrol , on policing . He has to make all these judgments.
And then after Timor , 9/11 has happened , he ' s named U.N . Human Rights Commissioner , and he has to balance liberty and security and figure out , what do you do when the most powerful country in the United Nations is bowing out of the Geneva Conventions , bowing out of international law ?  Do you denounce ? 
So Sergio -- this receptacle of all of this learning on how to deal with evil and how to deal with brokenness , lay under the rubble for three and a half hours without rescue.
You ' re un-owned.
And this was the pulley system . This was what we were able to muster for Sergio.
Here ' s this guy who got a 34-year head start thinking about the kinds of questions we as a country are grappling with , we as citizens are grappling with now . What do we take away ? 
I think that was his greatest quality.
He just had the rules , he had the norms , and he tried to use them.
He started , as I mentioned , to get in the room with evil , to not denounce , and became almost obsequious when he won the nickname Serbio , for instance , and even when he negotiated with the Khmer Rouge would black-box what had occurred prior to entering the room.
And I think that ' s something that we have to be in the room , whether it ' s Nixon going to China or Khrushchev and Kennedy or Reagan and Gorbachev.
Second take-away from Sergio ' s life , briefly.
At a macro level , he thought , you know , we talk about democracy promotion , but we do it in a way sometimes that ' s an affront to people ' s dignity.
Third point , very briefly . He talked a lot about freedom from fear.
Let ' s not hype the threat ; let ' s actually see it clearly.
In times of fear , for instance , one of the things Sergio used to say is , fear is a bad advisor.
How Sisyphean this task was of mending , and yet aware of that complexity , humbled by it , he wasn ' t paralyzed by it.
And the lesson , I think , of the anti-genocide movement that I mentioned , that is a partial success but by no means has it achieved what it has set out to do -- it ' ll be many decades , probably , before that happens -- but is that if we want to see change , we have to become the change.
http://www.ted.com/talks/josette_sheeran_ending_hunger_now.html
Josette Sheeran : Ending hunger now
And I carry this around as a symbol , really , of the challenge and also the hope.
First , I ' ll ask you : Why should you care ? 
Some are driven by compassion , feel it ' s perhaps one of the fundamental acts of humanity.
The destabilizing effects of hunger are known throughout human history.
This is not a negotiable thing , hunger.
But I actually came to this issue in a different way.
One two years earlier had killed more than a million people.
And it was at that moment that I just was filled with the challenge and the outrage that actually we know how to fix this problem.
We actually have the technology and systems.
This is last week in northern Kenya.
And we know that the issue is not just production of food.
And I also want to talk about what I call our new burden of knowledge.
And we can see brain volumes up to 40 percent less in these children.
So this burden of knowledge drives me.
I ' d like to talk about where the gap of knowledge is.
In Mauritania , less than three percent.
The second thing I ' d like to talk about : If you were living in a remote village somewhere , your child was limp , and you were in a drought , or you were in floods , or you were in a situation where there wasn ' t adequate diversity of diet , what would you do ? 
Even if they know what they need to do , it ' s not available.
We did this with food technologists in India and Pakistan -- really about three of them.
And this is climate-proof.
Eighty percent of the people in the world have no food safety net.
And if you fill the cup with local agriculture from small farmers , you have a transformative effect.
But what is most amazing is the effect on girls.
Families need the help.
We know this.
I ' d like to talk about what I call our warehouses for hope.
And we said , listen , during the lean season , take the food out.
For the past two years , 500 of these villages where these are have not needed any food aid -- they ' re self-sufficient.
I love this idea that came from the village level : three keys to unlock that warehouse.
Technology is transforming the face of food vulnerability in places where you see classic famine.
Food can be there and people can ' t buy it.
They have to be nutritious , and they have to be locally produced.
We now deliver food in over 30 countries over cell phones , transforming even the presence of refugees in countries , and other ways.
And guess what ? 
Today , food aid , our food aid -- huge engine -- 80 percent of it is bought in the developing world.
Well I ' d like to talk about Brazil , because I ' ve taken a journey to Brazil over the past couple of years , when I read that Brazil was defeating hunger faster than any nation on Earth right now.
And this zero hunger program costs .5 percent of GDP and has lifted many millions of people out of hunger and poverty.
The fact is studies show that the cost of malnutrition and hunger -- the cost to society , the burden it has to bear -- is on average six percent , and in some countries up to 11 percent , of GDP a year.
The amazing thing I ' ve found is nothing can change on a big scale without the determination of a leader.
Because food is one issue that cannot be solved person by person , nation by nation.
What I would like to offer here is a challenge.
And I would like you to join with all of humanity to draw a line in the sand and say ,  " No more.
Too often , says David Agus cancer treatments have a short-sighted focus on individual cells . He suggests a new , cross-disciplinary approach , using atypical drugs , computer modeling and protein analysis to diagnose and treat the whole body.
I ' m a cancer doctor , and I walked out of my office and walked by the pharmacy in the hospital three or four years ago , and this was the cover of Fortune magazine sitting in the window of the pharmacy.
For the last 50 years , we have focused on treating the individual gene in understanding cancer , not in controlling cancer.
So , what I ' m going to tell you today , is a little bit of why I think that ' s the case , and then go out of my comfort zone and tell you where I think it ' s going , where a new approach -- that we hope to push forward in terms of treating cancer.
They way we make the diagnosis today is by pattern recognition : Does it look normal ?  Does it look abnormal ? 
There ' s no molecular test , there ' s no sequencing of genes that was referred to yesterday , there ' s no fancy looking at the chromosomes.
It is the only way you can start to fight cancer , is by catching it early.
I co-founded a company called Navigenics , where , if you spit into a tube -- and we can look look at 35 or 40 genetic markers for disease , all of which are delayable in many of the cancers -- you start to identify what you could get , and then we can start to work to prevent them.
Because evolution doesn ' t care about us after we ' ve had our children.
Why is it hard to treat ? 
So , one of the fundamental problems we have in cancer is that , right now , we describe it by a number of adjectives , symptoms :  " I ' m tired , I ' m bloated , I have pain , etc. " 
So , our dictionary for describing cancer is very , very poor.
So , it is the idea of sequencing all of the genes in the cancer , and giving us a new lexicon , a new dictionary to describe it.
It makes no sense , if you think about it.
So , hopefully , we will go from being the art of medicine more to the science of medicine , and be able to do what they do in infectious disease , which is look at that organism , that bacteria , and then say ,  " This antibiotic makes sense , because you have a particular bacteria that will respond to it. " 
The first cancer was done , which was brain cancer.
I ' m doing it so we can identify what we ' re up against.
If you could start to move that , to identify what you ' re up against , you ' re going to do things a hell of a lot better.
So , the website of the National Cancer Institute says that cancer is a genetic disease.
So , there you see , it ' s a liver with colon cancer in it , and you see into the microscope a lymph node where cancer has invaded.
It ' s what we call a system.
And that is a very different optimization scheme , a very different strategy for all of us.
And , believe it or not , there were hisses in the audience.
I said ,  " Do I really want to meet a guy from Disney , who designed computers ?  " 
And I ' ll show you some data there where I really think it can make a difference and a new way to approach it.
But if during one of those days your temperature spiked to 102 for six hours , and you took Tylenol and got better , etc. , I would totally miss it.
You know , I ' ve been using it for two and a half months.
And so , if you think of cancer as a system , there ' s an input and an output and a state in the middle.
So what we do in our field is we change and input , we give aggressive chemotherapy , and we say ,  " Did that output get better ?  Did that pain improve , etc. ?  " 
A neuron under the microscope is very elegant with little things sticking out and little things over here , but when you start to put them together in a complex system , and you start to see that it becomes a brain , and that brain can create intelligence , what we ' re talking about in the body , and cancer is starting to model it like a complex system.
One of the most fundamental clinical trials in cancer came out in February in the New England Journal of Medicine , where they took women who were pre-menopausal with breast cancer.
They looked and , in these 1,800 women , given twice a year a drug that builds bone , you reduce the recurrence of cancer by 35 percent.
Nobody has ever shown -- and this will be shocking -- nobody has ever shown that most chemotherapy actually touches a cancer cell.
And a response is 50 percent shrinkage.
They then recur , I give them that same drug over 96 hours by continuous infusion , another 20 or 30 percent will respond.
The wild thing about that trial also , was that it reduced new primaries , so new cancers , by 30 percent also.
And I ' m sorry if you can ' t read the numbers , they ' re kind of small.
So the diseases we have today , which reflect patterns in the system over the last several decades , are going to change dramatically over the next decade or so based on things like this.
Each of the red dots are where a protein has actually been identified.
So this is a woman , 46 years old , who had recurrent lung cancer.
And so what this is , is we ' re taking a cross-section of her body here , and you can see in the middle there is her heart , and to the side of her heart on the left there is this large tumor that will invade and will kill her , untreated , in a matter of weeks.
That ' s about it.
So , it was done on this group of patients.
The amazing thing is another company did the right scientific trial , where they gave half placebo and half the drug.
But they did that , and what they found is that 70 percent of the non-responders lived much longer and did better than people who got placebo.
The problem is that , if I ' m this doc , and I get your CT scan today and you ' ve got a two centimeter mass in your liver , and you come back to me in three months and it ' s three centimeters , did that drug help you or not ? 
And , again , that ' s where these new technologies can come in.
But if one is unfortunate to get a disease , you ' ll go into your doctor ' s office , he or she will take a drop of blood , and we will start to know how to treat your disease.
So , there ' s no technology in the world that can span 11 orders of magnitude.
And I think one of the exciting things that is starting to happen now is that people from those fields are coming in.
So , just for two seconds , how these technologies work -- because I think it ' s important to understand it.
And so , as a cancer doctor , instead of having paper in my chart , in your chart , and it being this thick , this is what data flow is starting to look like in our offices , where that drop of blood is creating gigabytes of data.
We need to start to think differently and radically.
You know , Andy Grove stepped down as chairman of the board at Intel -- and Andy was one of my mentors , tough individual.
Playing sound effects both pleasant and awful , Julian Treasure shows how sound affects us in four significant ways . Listen carefully for a shocking fact about noisy open-plan offices.
Over the next five minutes , my intention is to transform your relationship with sound.
There are four major ways sound is affecting you all the time , and I ' d like to raise them in your consciousness today.
It ' s not just unpleasant sounds like that that do it.
There is a deep resonance with being at rest.
This is guaranteed to make most of you feel pretty sad if I leave it on.
There is a reason for that . Over hundreds of thousands of years we ' ve learned that when the birds are singing , things are safe.
Try and listen to the other one.
You are one third as productive in open-plan offices as in quiet rooms.
With all that other stuff going on , it would be amazing if our behavior didn ' t change.
For people who can ' t get away from noise like that , it ' s extremely damaging for their health.
They are losing up to 30 percent of their business with people leaving shops faster , or just turning around on the door.
At last we ' ve got some science we can apply.
I ' ll give you two examples.
Now , those are one-second samples of music.
There are eight expressions of a brand in sound.
1.8 billion times a day , that tune is played.
That increases impact by over 1,100 percent.
Secondly , make it appropriate to the situation.
Sound is complex . There are many countervailing influences.
It ' s good for your health . It ' s good for your productivity.
Thank you for lending me your ears today.

But basically , I figured out that I could find those alien creatures right on Earth.
Without insects , there ' d be no flowering plants.
The fly is going to sense this predator.
I think this is a fascinating behavior that shows how fast the fly ' s brain can process information.
Well , I spent a lot of my early career trying to figure out how insect wings generate enough force to keep the flies in the air.
And it turns out that the insects flap their wings in a very clever way , at a very high angle of attack that creates a structure at the leading edge of the wing , a little tornado-like structure called a leading edge vortex , and it ' s that vortex that actually enables the wings to make enough force for the animal to stay in the air.
The engine of the fly is absolutely fascinating.
And of course , the role of the nervous system is to control all this.
They have a sophisticated eye which is the fastest visual system on the planet.
Their wing is covered with sensors , including sensors that sense deformation of the wing.
These devices beat back and forth about 200 hertz during flight , and the animal can use them to sense its body rotation and initiate very , very fast corrective maneuvers.
I don ' t think they ' re a simple model of anything.
So I think , unfortunately , a lot of neuroscientists , we ' re all somewhat narcissistic.
Well , it ' s simple in the sense that it has fewer neurons , but is that a fair metric ? 
We ' ll calculate the Trump number for the fruit fly.
Now I realize that it is a little bit absurd to compare the behavioral repertoire of a human to a fly.
And then something happened when I started to work on flies.
They do a lot of the similar things.
Watch it very closely , and you ' ll see why my six-year-old son now wants to be a neuroscientist.
Now , I want to get across that it ' s not just a matter of numbers but also the challenge for a fly to compute everything its brain has to compute with such tiny neurons.
And it ' s a beautifully complex neuron.
So here ' s some other organisms at the similar scale.
I would posit that one frontier in neuroscience is to figure out how the brain of that thing works.
And these are the two concepts I ' d like to explore.
I grew up in Baltimore , and I chew crabs very , very well.
And here ' s an endoscopic movie of this structure.
And this is the work by Eve Marder and her many colleagues who ' ve been studying this fascinating system that show how a smaller cluster of neurons can do many , many , many things because of neuromodulation that can take place on a moment-by-moment basis.
Is there any evidence that flies do this ? 
You can let the fly play a little video game by letting it fly around in a visual display.
It ' s part of their visual guidance system.
It was a sequence taken from another post-doc in the lab , Bettina Schnell.
And why is the physiology different ? 
But this is just one of many neuromodulators that ' s in the fly ' s brain.
It ' s a non-spiking cell.
So these basic concepts of multitasking in time and multitasking in space , I think these are things that are true in our brains as well , but I think the insects are the true masters of this.
brain,computers,consciousness,mind,neurology,philosophy,technology
And we ' ve done , in the past four years , a proof of concept on a small part of the rodent brain , and with this proof of concept we are now scaling the project up to reach the human brain.
The second reason is , we cannot keep doing animal experimentation forever , and we have to embody all our data and all our knowledge into a working model.
Now , even at this stage , we can use the brain model to explore some fundamental questions about how the brain works.
But , for the first time , we can actually address this , with brain simulation , and ask very systematic and rigorous questions , whether this theory could possibly be true.
We make a decision it ' s that big , even though it ' s not that big.
What they do is they introduce a noise into the brain so that the neurons cannot understand each other.
So , when you walk up to a door and you open it , what you compulsively have to do to perceive is to make decisions , thousands of decisions about the size of the room , the walls , the height , the objects in this room.
But I cannot say ,  " You think , therefore you are, "  because  " you "  are within my perceptual bubble.
Is it capable of doing it ? 
It had to improve it a little bit.
The mammals needed it because they had to cope with parenthood , social interactions , complex cognitive functions.
And it has not stopped its evolutionary path.
They were so successful in evolution that what we did was to duplicate them over and over and add more and more of them to the brain until we ran out of space in the skull.
Each of these neocortical columns would produce a note.
Now , of course it takes years to learn how to master a grand piano with a million keys.
You may be born lucky , where you know how to master your neocortical column , and you can play a fantastic symphony.
The perception , the symphony that you create is going to be corrupted , and you will have symptoms of disease.
How many trees does it have ? 
They choose very carefully who they connect with.
And here we ' re coiling them up.
Now , the circuit , you could also think of as the fabric of the brain.
Every neuron is different.
And your neurons are not going to be oriented and positioned in exactly the same way.
Well , we don ' t have to speculate.
We can position them in different places , orient them in different places.
So , the fabric of the brain , even though your brain may be smaller , bigger , it may have different types of neurons , different morphologies of neurons , we actually do share the same fabric.
And , in fact , the equations that make neurons into electrical generators were discovered by two Cambridge Nobel Laureates.
It ' s like electrical shock that releases the chemicals from these synapses.
But what you do need is a very big computer.
So now we have this Blue Gene supercomputer.
It ' s the first view.
We can ask ,  " Where is it inside , if we stimulate it with a picture ?  " 
Because that is what it ' s creating.
And then when we zoomed into this , it ' s like a veritable universe.
There is a lot more to do to test these theories , and to test any other theories.
Extreme runner Ray Zahab shares an enthusiastic account of his record-breaking trek on foot to the South Pole -- a 33-day sprint through the snow.
A month ago today I stood there : 90 degrees south , the top of the bottom of the world , the Geographic South Pole.
We shaved five days off the previous best time.
It ' s going to be 40 below , every single day.
The punchline to your journey ?  Look at the horizon.
A couple of buddies of mine and I had finished a 111-day run across the entire Sahara desert.
But if I ' m going to continue doing these adventures , there has to be a reason for me to do them beyond just getting there.
So we would have a live website , that every single day of the 33 days , we would be blogging , telling stories of , you know , depleted ozone forcing us to cover our faces , or we will burn.
We ' d catch cat-naps at 40 below on our sled , incidentally.
I ' m not going to answer that . But I will answer some of the more popular questions.
How many batteries do you carry for all the equipment that you have ? 
They were our teammates! They were inspiring us.
We arrived at the South Pole . We huddled into that tent , 45 below that day , I ' ll never forget it.
As I stand here today talking to you guys , I ' ve been running for the grand sum of five years.
Can you imagine ?  Seriously , can you imagine ? 
http://www.ted.com/talks/sylvia_earle_s_ted_prize_wish_to_protect_our_oceans.html
Sylvia Earle ' s TED Prize wish to protect our oceans
It does concern you , as well.
Health to the ocean means health for us.
For me , as a scientist , it all began in 1953 when I first tried scuba.
In 1979 I had a chance to put my footprints on the ocean floor while using this personal submersible called Jim.
I led a five-year National Geographic expedition , the Sustainable Seas expeditions , using these little subs.
I heard astronaut Joe Allen explain how he had to learn everything he could about his life support system and then do everything he could to take care of his life support system ; and then he pointed to this and he said ,  " Life support system. " 
No blue , no green.
I gave a talk not so long ago at the World Bank and I showed this amazing image of Earth and I said ,  " There it is! The World Bank! " 
With every drop of water you drink , every breath you take , you ' re connected to the sea.
The ocean drives climate and weather , stabilizes temperature , shapes Earth ' s chemistry.
That may have been true 10,000 years ago , and maybe even 1,000 years ago but in the last 100 , especially in the last 50 , we ' ve drawn down the assets , the air , the water , the wildlife that make our lives possible.
And with knowing comes caring.
But I asked him :  " When are you going to finish it ? 
And as of just this week , last Monday , Google Earth is now whole.
We can go actually and swim around on Google Earth and visit with humpback whales.
Imagine that . It ' s only seven miles , but only two people have been there , 49 years ago.
We need to see deep trenches , the undersea mountains , and understand life in the deep sea.
That ' s bad news for the polar bears.
Also it ' s bad news for us.
Barbarically , we ' re killing sharks for shark fin soup , undermining food chains that shape planetary chemistry and drive the carbon cycle , the nitrogen cycle , the oxygen cycle , the water cycle -- our life support system.
Industrial trawlers and draggers are scraping the sea floor like bulldozers , taking everything in their path.
This is the consequence of not knowing that there are limits to what we can take out of the sea.
Most of the turtles , sharks , tunas and whales are way down in numbers.
There are still some krill in Antarctica.
But business as usual means that in 50 years , there may be no coral reefs -- and no commercial fishing , because the fish will simply be gone.
And in 1872 , with Yellowstone National Park , the United States began establishing a system of parks that some say was the best idea America ever had.
The good news is that there are now more than 4,000 places in the sea , around the world , that have some kind of protection.
But it only increased from 0.6 of one percent to 0.8 of one percent of the ocean protected , globally.
With scientists around the world , I ' ve been looking at the 99 percent of the ocean that is open to fishing -- and mining , and drilling , and dumping , and whatever -- to search out hope spots , and try to find ways to give them and us a secure future.
97 percent of the land in the Galapagos Islands is protected , but the adjacent sea is being ravaged by fishing.
There are still places in the sea as pristine as I knew as a child.
We need many things to keep and maintain the world as a better place.
A global plan of action with a world conservation union , the IUCN , is underway to protect biodiversity , to mitigate and recover from the impacts of climate change , on the high seas and in coastal areas , wherever we can identify critical places.
We need , maybe , an expedition -- a TED at sea -- that could help figure out the next steps.
Some say 10 percent , some say 30 percent.
For the children of today , for tomorrow ' s child : as never again , now is the time.

Steve told us about the future of little technology ; I ' m going to show you some of the past of big technology.
I ' m going to show you some stuff that not only has not been declassified , but has now been reclassified.
That ' s me and my sister , Esther , who ' s a frequent TEDster.
Just so you know , I am not Dr . Strangelove.
My father was not going to take his children ; that was one of the reasons we sort of had a falling out for a few years.
So put that library at the bottom of that ship -- that ' s how big the thing was going to be.
That ' s the contract where ARPA gave the first million dollars to get this thing started.
These are the statistics of what would be the good places to go and stop.
Here we see a 10,000 ton ship will deliver 1,300 tons to Saturn and back ; essentially a five year trip.
NASA had no interest ; they tried to kill the project.
There ' s another version there that sends retaliatory strikes at the Soviet Union.
This is what ' s happened at 600 microseconds.
These are stills from film footage that was saved by someone who was supposed to destroy it but didn ' t and kept it in their basement for the last 40 years.
That ' s my dad in the sport coat there holding the briefcase.
Jeff Bezos kindly , yesterday , said he ' ll put this video up on the Amazon site -- some little clip of it.
If you saw the 1959 .. . This is what it would feel like in the passenger compartment ; that ' s acceleration profile.
Eyeburn : this is what happens to the people in Miami who are looking up.
So this is what NASA did , getting an eight man version that would go to Mars.
This is a 20 man version for going to Jupiter : bunks , storm cellars , exercise room.
The sort of artist conceptions : these are basically PowerPoint presentations given to the Air Force 40 years ago.
Results : none.
And Orion is really one of the only , if not the only , off-the-shelf technologies that could do something.
That ' s the good news . The bad news is , when I got in contact with these people to try and get some documents from them , they went crazy because I had all this stuff that they don ' t have , and NASA purchased 1,759 pages of this stuff from me.

Not yours , of course -- other people ' s.
And I came up with an idea that I will write a cookbook.
You know , we do so much in the kitchen I thought this would be interesting.
Until somebody said ,  " Look , if you ' re serious about this , you first have to write a book about your research . You have to publish something , and then you ' ll get the opportunity to write something else.
Something a bit more free , less constrained. " 
And it turned out to be quite fun in two ways.
People write me about their personal experience , and about their examples , and what they disagree , and nuances.
And I want to start by giving you some examples of visual illusion as a metaphor for rationality.
Which one seems longer ? 
So I can put some lines on ; it doesn ' t help.
You can ' t look at this and say ,  " Okay now I see reality as it is. " 
Here is another one -- this is one of my favorite illusions.
Turns out they ' re identical.
And if I cover the rest of the cube you can see that they are identical.
I guess maybe if you ' re colorblind I don ' t think you can see that.
We do more vision more hours of the day than we do anything else.
Because in visual illusions we can easily demonstrate the mistakes ; in cognitive illusion it ' s much , much harder to demonstrate to people the mistakes.
And it basically shows the percentage of people who indicated they would be interested in giving their organs to donation.
Right ?  How much do you care about people ? 
For example , Sweden is all the way on the right , and Denmark , that we think is culturally very similar , is all the way on the left.
But it turns out that from organ donation they are very different.
You know the expression ,  " Begging only gets you so far "  ? 
Turns out the secret has to do with a form at the DMV.
And what happens ? 
Interestingly enough , when people get this , they again don ' t check -- but now they join.
And we open the refrigerator and we feel that we decide what to eat.
Now it ' s also very hard to intuit these results . Think about it for yourself.
But when it comes to us , we have such a feeling that we are at the driver ' s seat , we have such a feeling that we are in control , and we are making the decision , that it ' s very hard to even accept the idea that we actually have an illusion of making a decision , rather than an actual decision.
So a standard economist , someone who believes in rationality , would say ,  " You know what ?  The cost of lifting the pencil and marking a V is higher than the possible benefit of the decision , so that ' s why we get this effect. " 
It ' s difficult and it ' s complex.
This is from a paper by Redelmeier and Schaefer.
Here is a patient . He is a 67-year-old farmer.
So you refer the patient to hip replacement therapy.
You did not try ibuprofen.
Very good for the physicians.
And if you pull them back do you try ibuprofen or piroxicam ?  Which one ?  " 
What happens now ? 
Let ' s go for hip replacement. " 
Do you want to go for a weekend to Rome ? 
Now imagine I added a choice to the set that nobody wanted.
What if it was a trip to Rome , all expenses paid , transportation , breakfast , but doesn ' t include coffee in the morning.
But guess what happened . The moment you add Rome without coffee , Rome with coffee becomes more popular . And people choose it.
An online subscription for 59 dollars.
And I tried to figure out what were they thinking.
So I decided to do the experiment that I would have loved The Economist to do with me.
Thankfully nobody wanted the dominated option.
I gave it to another 100 students . Here is what happens.
But it wasn ' t useless in the sense that it helped people figure out what they wanted.
And because we don ' t know our preferences that well we ' re susceptible to all of these influences from the external forces : the defaults , the particular options that are presented to us , and so on.
So I decided to do this experiment with people.
I said  " Who do you want to date ?  Tom or Jerry ?  " 
And the question was , will ugly Jerry and ugly Tom help their respective , more attractive brothers ? 
This of course has two very clear implications for life in general.
The second point , or course , is that if somebody else invites you , you know how they think about you.
 " What a piece of work is man! How noble in reason! " 
But there is a silver lining.
We build steps . And we build these things that not everybody can use obviously.
And that , I think , is the hope of this thing.
Internet,invention,technology
And these are base stations.
This is a 6 with 14 zeroes -- a very large number.
And it ' s this importance why I decided to look into the issues that this technology has , because it ' s so fundamental to our lives.
They are scarce ; they are expensive ; and we only have a certain range of it.
That is efficiency.
And that creates a big problem.
And security is another issue.
But on the other hand , we have 14 billion of these : light bulbs , light.
X-rays , useful when you go to hospitals.
And then we have the radio waves , they have the issues I ' ve just mentioned.
So it ' s inherently safe to use.
And guess what ? 
And multiply that by 10,000 , then you end up at 14 billion.
Go to the main floor , you see these light bulbs.
The one thing we need to do is we have to replace these inefficient incandescent light bulbs , florescent lights , with this new technology of LED , LED light bulbs.
And this is a fundamental basic property that we exploit with our technology.
And it creates a simple , low-speed data stream in 10,000 bits per second , 20,000 bits per second.
And the technology we have developed -- it ' s called SIM OFDM.
What we ' ve done is we have also developed a demonstrator.
And then what we have here is a little hole.
And that signal is then converted back to a high-speed data stream.
As you would expect , it ' s a light , a desk lamp.
And that ' s a video , a high-definition video that is transmitted through that light beam.
But let me do this.
And if you look at the light , it is illuminating as you would expect.
And you see , even light from the ceiling comes down here to the receiver.
But , you can dim down the light to a level that it appears to be off.
You would agree with me , hopefully , there ' s no issue of capacity anymore.
If the whole world would deploy them , you would save hundreds of power plants.
You need to see what to do.
It has a flashlight , an LED flashlight.
So no one , if I have a light here , if I have secure data , no one on the other side of this room through that wall would be able to read that data.
Now we can in fact see where the data is going to.
But I can give you a few examples.
And this light can be used to transmit wireless data that these things [use] to communicate with each other.
Traffic lights can communicate to the car and so on.
And then we have these aircraft cabins.
So , all we would need to do is to fit a small microchip to every potential illumination device.
Thank you.

In this case , it was picking up bones and creating a tool , using it as a tool , which meant that apes just , sort of , running around and eating and doing each other figured out they can make things if they used a tool.
We ' ve seen the creation of small computers in the  ' 70s and early  ' 80s , and who would have thought back then that every single person would not have just one computer but probably 20 , in your home , and in not just your P.C . but in every device -- in your washing machine , your cell phone.
How ' s your genome today ?  Have you thought about it lately ? 
People never want to say , I really don ' t understand.
And one thing that is common to all of life is DNA.
We ' ve also along the way discovered that this is a very old molecule , that all of the DNA in your body has been around forever , since the beginning of us , of us as creatures.
It is the program . It is the code of life.
Really all you have to know about it is that there ' s four letters : A , T , C , G ; they represent the name of a chemical.
And that may not sound very intuitive , but let me flip over to something else you know about , and that ' s computers.
So , when you ' re listening to iTunes and your favorite music , that ' s really just a bunch of ones and zeros playing very quickly.
So , let ' s talk about what that means.
It ' s not really all that much data.
In fact , many , many diseases we have struggled with for a long time , like cancer , we haven ' t been able to cure because we just don ' t understand how it works at the genomic level.
What is the code ? 
We actually have about 24,000 genes that do things.
Now , look around : just look next to your neighbor , look forward , look backward . We all look pretty different.
So , we are now able to read genomes.
And if you think about the computer industry and how we ' ve gone from big computers to little ones and how they get more powerful and faster all the time , the same thing is happening with gene sequencing now : we are on the cusp of being able to sequence human genomes for about 5,000 dollars in about an hour or a half-hour ; you will see that happen in the next five years.
All those side effects , you know , oily residue and , you know , whatever they say in those commercials : forget about that.
If you saw the genome for a mouse or for a human it would look no different than this , but what scientists are doing now is they ' re understanding what these do and what they mean.
For me it may be : every calorie you consume , you conserve , because I come from a very cold climate.
Well , there ' s many things . Some are exciting.
You can find out where your relatives come from ; you can do your genealogy going back thousands of years.
Because we can understand this , we can fix them , make better organisms.
We are now not just reading genomes ; we are writing them.
Now , you have the genome and you say to yourself , So , if I plug this synthetic genome -- if I pull the old one out and plug it in -- does it just boot up and live ? 
Well , actually , you could do it the other way.
The genomic sequence now exists for the entire Pinot Noir organism , and they identified , once again , about 29,000 genes.
They now are understanding , and the work is going on , exactly how this plant works , and we have the capability to know , to read that entire code and understand how it ticks.
We can build a better vine.
So , we could , you know , focus on disease resistance ; we can go for higher yields without necessarily having dramatic farming techniques to do it , or costs.
All of these things could conceivably be done , and I will tell you I ' d pretty much bet that it will be done.
Our ocean ' s teaming with microbes ; in fact , when Craig Venter went and sequenced the microbes in the ocean , in the first three months tripled the known species on the planet by discovering all-new microbes in the first 20 feet of water.
If you take a closer look at a root system , you will find there are many , many , many diverse microbial colonies.
We can start to figure that out.
We can figure out what the heck terroir is.
All we have to do is go around and sample , dig into the ground , find those bugs , sequence them , correlate them to the kinds of characteristics we like and don ' t like -- that ' s just a big database -- and then fertilize.
And , you know , people would always ask James Watson -- he ' s not always the most politically correct guy ...
I don ' t believe that chemicals are unnatural.
We reorganize things , we change them around , but we don ' t make anything unnatural.
There are microbes , you know -- go back to yeast.
We can ' t make the grape plant produce babies.
So , carbon dioxide -- the stuff we want to get rid of -- not sugar , not anything.
Well , you know , I think the answer is very simple : working with Nature , working with this tool set that we now understand , is the next step in humankind ' s evolution.
Speaking at the 2007 EG conference , trainer Ian Dunbar asks us to see the world through the eyes of our beloved dogs . By knowing our pets '  perspective , we can build their love and trust . It ' s a message that resonates well beyond the animal world.
Dogs have interests.
I ' m sniffing this other dog ' s rear end , the owner ' s calling. " 
You cannot compete with the environment , if you have an adolescent dog ' s brain.
So the human says ,  " You ' re going to act this way , damn it.
So you get a little puppy , he comes . His only crime is he grew.
His one mistake is he ' s a Tibetan mastiff , and a few months later , he weighs , you know , 80 pounds.
And they take this stuff seriously.
And what you will find is a very , very low-ranking bitch will quite easily keep a bone away from a high-ranking male.
And the reason is built into their behavior -- is to always come back and apologize.
 " Hold his front paws , squeeze his front paws , stamp on his hind feet , squirt him in the face with lemon juice , hit him on the head with a rolled-up newspaper , knee him in the chest , flip him over backwards. " 
I ask owners ,  " Well , how would you like the dog to greet you ?  " 
Because the first stage is basically teaching a dog ESL.
Well , I ' ve got news for you.
My wife doesn ' t need food -- she ' s a great trainer , much better than I am.
You know ,  " Sit , sit. " 
And I ' ve taught her  " Phoenix, "   " come here, "   " take this, "   " go to "  and the name of my son ,  " Jamie. " 
Will it do it ? 
The dog can sniff your butt , if you like , when he wants to.
Basically , we follow a low-frequency behavior -- one the dog doesn ' t want to do -- by a high-frequency behavior , commonly known as a behavior problem , or a dog hobby -- something the dog does like to do.
 " Sit, "  sniff butt.
They ' re like Golden Retrievers.
Then I have my own personal doorman , chauffeur , masseuse , chef and waiter. " 
Now we move to phase three , when now -- there ' s times , you know , when daddy knows best.
This is a life-or-death thing.
People here get very confused about what a punishment is.
It doesn ' t have to be.
I was working with a very dangerous dog about a year ago.
A lot of the aggression happened around the kitchen , so while I was there -- this was on the fourth visit -- we did a four and a half hour down-stay , with the dog on his mat.
The breaks got fewer and fewer.
If she did , she would have got bitten.
 " Bad bear , bad bear! "  Voom!
We want a better way.
Not just with their puppy , but with the rest of the family at class.
The dog says ,  " I don ' t think so. " 
I was walking onto a plane -- this , for me , was a pivotal moment in my career , and it really cemented what I wanted to do with this whole puppy-training thing , the notion of how to teach puppies in a dog-friendly way to want to do what we want to do , so we don ' t have to force them.
Kick , kick , kick.
And ugly face is this -- when you go face-to-face with a puppy or a child , you say ,  " What are you doing! Now stop it , stop it , stop it! " 
I thought ,  " Ian , stay out of it , stay out of it , you know , walk on. " 
He kicked a child , grabs the child like this and I let it go.
You know , kind of like a little robot.
The husband won ' t clear up his clothes , or the wife ' s always late for meetings , whatever it is , OK ? 
You see it ' s especially in families , especially with spouses , especially with children , especially with parents.
It really is.
When I was a kid , I was a calculus whiz.
And my look to the future is , and what I want to do with this doggy stuff , is to teach people that you know , your husband ' s just as easy to train.
If it ' s good , say ,  " That was really neat , thank you. " 
How you do negotiate with your friend who wants your toy ? 
No , this is what should be taught -- the good living , the good habits , which are just as hard to break as bad habits.
Architect Joshua Prince-Ramus takes the audience on dazzling , dizzying virtual tours of three recent projects : the Central Library in Seattle , the Museum Plaza in Louisville and the Charles Wyly Theater in Dallas.
I ' m going to present three projects in rapid fire.
It ' s a process that takes rationality almost to an absurd level , and it transcends all the baggage that normally comes with what people would call , sort of , a rational conclusion to something.
This is something that has editing and it has teams.
Almost anything can happen within them.
But as we ' re seeing , operational costs are starting to dwarf capital costs in terms of design parameters.
They can be pushed off-center a little bit , but in the end you actually still get as much of that original spectrum as you originally had hoped.
This is the first one , and this is showing , over the last 900 years , the evolution of the book and other technologies.
Our mandate is media , and particularly the book. " 
We don ' t know the future of the library ; we don ' t know the future of the book ; and so we ' ll use this approach.
And so we proposed what ' s at the lower diagram.
What you ' re seeing here is actually their program on the left.
So , once we had presented that back to them , they agreed that this sort of core concept could work.
On the left of that diagram , here , you ' ll see a series of five platforms -- sort of combs , collective programs.
OK ?  And , as you can see , it is literally the diagram on the right.
They ' re super-efficient . We had a very low budget to work with.
So , you see the five platforms -- those are the boxes -- within each one a very discrete thing is happening.
It just so happens to be in the sixth through 10th floor of the building , but that is not necessarily an expensive approach.
One , it is the lateral stability for the entire building ; it is a structural element . But its dimensions were designed not only for structure , but also for holding on every piece of glass.
Let ' s see if I can find it . For anyone who is -- gets motion sickness , I apologize.
This is going into one of the entries.
It was recognizing that public libraries are the last vestige of public free space.
That was the main sort of technology area in the building.
She said yes.
You dizzy yet ? 
OK , now I ' m going to go back , and so I ' m going to hit a second project.
And the very fact that they worked on a provisional space meant that for Beckett they could blow out a wall ; they could do  " Cherry Orchard "  and blow a hole through the floor , and so forth.
And so they needed to be able to quickly transform between different theater organizations , and for operational budget reasons , this actually no longer happens in pretty much any multi-form theater in the United States , so we needed to figure out a way to overcome that.
And it allowed us to go back to first principles , and redefine fly tower , acoustic enclosure , light enclosure and so forth.
So an artistic director has the ability to show -- have a performance that enters in a Wagnerian procession , shows the first act in thrust , the intermission in a Greek procession , second act in arena , and so forth.
The light enclosure can be lifted separate to the acoustic enclosure , so you can do Beckett with Dallas as the backdrop.
You can bring enormous objects in , so in fact their -- the Dallas Theater Company -- their first show will be a play about Charles Lindbergh , and they ' ll want to bring in [a] real aircraft.
And at night.
This also is an unusual client.
And the fact that they wanted to support the contemporary art museum actually built their pro forma , so they worked in reverse.
First : the physical constraints . We actually had to operate on three discrete sites , all of them well , well smaller than the size of the building.
Have to operate behind the I-64 corridor , a street that cuts through the middle of these separate sites.
And now we ' re going to add 1.1 million square feet.
So our strategy was very simple.
And again , when we unveiled it , there was a sort of nervousness that this was about an architect making a statement , not an architect who was attempting to solve a series of problems.
It allows people on exercise bicycles to be seen or to see the art , and so forth.
So , we begin by building the cores.
The moment the cores get to mid level , we finish the art museum ; we put all the mechanical equipment in it ; and then we jack it up into the air.
Chris asked me to add -- the theater is under construction , and this project will start construction in about a year , and finish in 2010.
1001
So , I wanted to do something special today.
Because it gets into all sorts of crazy realms.
And I ' m going to demonstrate for you.
There seems to be a rule in nature that if you get too close to where you came from , it gets ugly.
Because although I ' ve used scientific terms in songs , it ' s very difficult sometimes to make them lyrical.
And it ' s like your eyes start straining to see themselves.
It ' s impossible , of course , for your eyes to see themselves , but they seem to be trying.
So , I ' ve been working on this song that mentions these things and then also imagines a person who ' s been so successful at defending themselves from heartbreak that they ' re left to do the deed themselves , if that ' s possible.
♫ Go ahead and congratulate yourself ♫ ♫ Give yourself a hand , the hand is your hand ♫ ♫ And the eye that eyes itself is your eye ♫ ♫ And the ear that hears itself is near ♫ ♫  ' Cause it ' s your ear , oh oh ♫ ♫ You ' ve done the impossible now ♫ ♫ Took yourself apart ♫ ♫ You made yourself invulnerable ♫ ♫ No one can break your heart ♫ ♫ So you wear it out ♫ ♫ And you wring it out ♫ ♫ And you wear it out ♫ ♫ And you break it yourself ♫ ♫ Breaking your own , break it yourself ♫ ♫ Breaking your own , break it yourself ♫ ♫ Breaking your own ♫ Thanks.
But , you know , I think reckless curiosity would be what the world needs now , just a little bit.
When he was just 14 years old , Malawian inventor William Kamkwamba built his family an electricity-generating windmill from spare parts , working from rough plans he found in a library book.
Chris Anderson : William , hi . Good to see you.
CA : Where ?  What country ? 
CA : Five years ago you had an idea . What was that ? 
CA : What , to power -- for lighting and stuff ? 
CA : So you copied -- you exactly copied the design in the book.
CA : And you made it out of what ? 
CA : You tested three , and found that four worked better ? 
WK : I use a bicycle frame , and a pulley , and plastic pipe , what then pulls -- CA : Do we have a picture of that ?  Can we have the next slide ? 
CA : How much electricity ? 
CA : Wow.
CA : And so what ' s your -- what are you going to do with this ? 
CA : How big ? 
WK : Yeah , if they can help me with materials , yeah.
Thank you so much for coming.
arts,brain,culture
It ' s a rare condition.
They want to ask me something.
I ' m going to talk instead about something far more interesting than dates of birth or cube roots -- a little deeper and a lot closer , to my mind , than work.
In my books , I explore the nature of perception and how different kinds of perceiving create different kinds of knowing and understanding.
Or look at the foreign word and the sounds : can you get a sense of the range of meanings that it ' s pointing you towards ? 
I ' m an extreme example of this.
One is a flash of white light.
Four is blue.
It ' s a multiplication of two prime numbers.
It ' s an infinite number -- literally goes on forever.
And this is an opening phrase from the novel  " Lolita. " 
And I wonder if some of you will notice the construction of the sentence from  " The Great Gatsby. " 
64 multiplied by 75.
Well if 100 , if we think of 100 as being like a square , 75 would look like this.
Four across , four up and down -- it ' s 16.
Easy when you know how.
Hnugginn : is it a happy word , or a sad word ? 
Most people , a majority of people , say sad.
Let ' s have a look at the third question.
And poets , like other artists , play with those intuitive understandings.
They yield to the slightest movement or motion or emotion.
The overlong ears , the overlarge feet , helps us to picture , to feel intuitively , what it means to limp and to tremble.
http://www.ted.com/talks/matt_ridley_when_ideas_have_sex.html
Matt Ridley : When ideas have sex
A cancer epidemic caused by chemicals in the environment was going to shorten our lives.
None of those things happened , and astonishingly , if you look at what actually happened in my lifetime , the average per-capita income of the average person on the planet , in real terms , adjusted for inflation , has tripled.
And all this at a time when the population has doubled.
The size of the blob in this graph represents the size of the population , and the level of the graph represents GDP per capita.
These are both real objects.
I ' ve tried to work out which is bigger , and it ' s almost impossible.
The differences are what interest me , because the one on the left was made to a pretty unvarying design for about a million years -- from one-and-a-half million years ago to half a million years ago.
It ' s an extraordinary phenomenon , but it ' s true.
And more than that , it ' s a confection of different ideas , the idea of plastic , the idea of a laser , the idea of transistors.
They ' ve come together.
One goes extinct for the other to survive.
What ' s the process that ' s having the same effect in cultural evolution as sex is having in biological evolution ? 
You can teach them in the laboratory to do a little bit of exchange -- and indeed there ' s reciprocity in other animals -- But the exchange of one object for another never happens.
Chimpanzees , killer whales , these kinds of creatures , they have culture.
Chimpanzee troops have different cultures in different troops.
And here is a Stone Age version of his story , although he told it in terms of trade between countries.
He doesn ' t need Adam.
So the gains from trade are only going to grow.
Ask yourself how long you would have to work to provide for yourself an hour of reading light this evening to read a book by.
How long is it going to take you ?  Quite a long time.
And that ' s seven and a half seconds of prosperity that you ' ve gained since 1950 , as it were , because that ' s seven and a half seconds in which you can do something else , or you can acquire another good or service.
Go back to this image of the axe and the mouse , and ask yourself :  " Who made them and for who ?  " 
But the object on the right was made for me by other people.
Because you ' ve got to include the man who grew the coffee , which was brewed for the man who was on the oil rig , who was drilling for oil , which was going to be made into the plastic , etc.
In the old days , if you were rich , you literally had people working for you.
He had 498 people to prepare his dinner every night.
We ' re able to draw upon specialization and exchange to raise each other ' s living standards.
There ' s no working for each other across the colonies.
In our species , we don ' t like doing that.
And how long has it been going on ?  And what does it mean ? 
In all hunter-gatherer societies today , there ' s a foraging division of labor between , on the whole , hunting males and gathering females.
And she doesn ' t have to go on an exhausting hunt and try and kill a warthog.
When did this happen ?  We don ' t know , but it ' s possible that Neanderthals didn ' t do this.
They were imaginative . They buried their dead.
But there ' s no evidence of a sexual division of labor.
For example , in the Caucasus there ' s a site where you find local Neanderthal tools.
Trade is 10 times as old as farming.
You also see seashells -- as discovered by a team here in Oxford -- moving 125 miles inland from the Mediterranean in Algeria.
Well , you look at modern hunter gatherers like aboriginals , who quarried for stone axes at a place called Mount Isa , which was a quarry owned by the Kalkadoon tribe.
And the answer is that not only do you slow down technological progress , you can actually throw it into reverse.
It ' s as if the people in this room were plonked on a desert island.
The Tasmanians were isolated.
Nobody , literally nobody.
He just knows how to run a company.
And what we ' ve done in human society , through exchange and specialization , is we ' ve created the ability to do things that we don ' t even understand.
We ' ve gone beyond the capacity of the human mind to an extraordinary degree.
So we ' ve created something called the collective brain.
However , bad things happen.
But I ' m also sure that , because of the connections people are making , and the ability of ideas to meet and to mate as never before , I ' m also sure that technology will advance , and therefore living standards will advance.
Biochemist Joe DeRisi talks about amazing new ways to diagnose viruses using DNA . His work may help us understand malaria , SARS , avian flu -- and the 60 percent of everyday viral infections that go undiagnosed.
How can we investigate this flora of viruses that surround us , and aid medicine ? 
First of all , viruses are pretty complex , but they ' re also evolving very fast.
When people think about making pan-viral detection reagents , usually it ' s the fast-evolving problem that ' s an issue , because how can we detect things if they ' re always changing ? 
I took a bunch of these small picornaviruses , like the common cold , like polio and so on , and I just broke them down into small segments.
Now , over here there ' s great diversity : that ' s where things are evolving fast.
OK , so that ' s what we did , but how are we going to do that ? 
So , what we ' re doing is just printing DNA on glass -- little flat things -- and these are going to be markers for pathogens.
Here ' s the section on the all-important emergency stop switch.
And so what we did -- and this is a really cool project -- we just started by making a respiratory virus chip.
And so what we did is , we take tissue culture cells and infect them with various viruses , and we take the stuff and fluorescently label the nucleic acid , the genetic material that comes out of these tissue culture cells -- mostly viral stuff -- and stick it on the array to see where it sticks.
And each spot represents a different family of virus or species of virus.
And then we did respiratory syncytial virus.
Polio and rhino : they ' re in the same family , very close to each other.
All right , I can see a rhinovirus -- and here ' s the blow-up of the rhinovirus ' s little barcode -- but what about different rhinoviruses ? 
Now , this is kind of a cheap shot , because I know what the genetic sequence of all these rhinoviruses is , and I in fact designed the chip expressly to be able to tell them apart , but what about rhinoviruses that have never seen a genetic sequencer ? 
But that ' s , again , shooting fish in a barrel , you know , right ? 
You have no idea what someone ' s going to cough into a cup , and it ' s probably really complex , right ? 
Well , it ' s pretty simple.
And basically we experimentally inoculate people with the common cold virus.
They got a shot of virus up the nose , let ' s see what happens.
It ' s pretty clean . If you ' re healthy , you ' re pretty healthy.
So , how about the people who walk in off the street ? 
Remember , our evolutionary-conserved sequences we ' re using on this array allow us to detect even novel or uncharacterized viruses , because we pick what is conserved throughout evolution.
But by the time you get to block nine , you see that respiratory syncytial virus.
This individual has parainfluenza-1 , and you can see that there ' s a little stripe over here for Sendai virus : that ' s mouse parainfluenza.
Why not ?  Every plant virus , every insect virus , every marine virus.
And the idea is that we simply have virtual patterns , because we ' re never going to get samples of every virus -- it would be virtually impossible . But we can get virtual patterns , and compare them to our observed result -- which is a very complex mixture -- and come up with some sort of score of how likely it is this is a rhinovirus or something.
So let ' s do something a little bit harder.
And so , this case report happened three weeks ago.
She came back after ten days of fever , right ?  Still has the fever , and she ' s hypoxic -- she doesn ' t have much oxygen in her lungs.
This sort of tree and bud formation indicates there ' s inflammation ; there ' s likely to be infection.
What to do next ?  Don ' t know.
You do an open lung biopsy when you ' ve got no other options.
All you can tell is , there ' s a lot of swelling : bronchiolitis.
Everything came back negative , over 100,000 dollars worth of tests.
We put it on the chip ; what do we see ?  Well , we saw parainfluenza-4.
There ' s just a little bit of it sequenced.
Clearly , we have a case of a healthy person that ' s going down.
Lots of risk factors , but there is a genetic predisposition to prostate cancer.
So , we ' re sitting around and thinking ,  " Why would men who have the mutation -- a defect in an antiviral defense system -- get prostate cancer ? 
And I ' m showing you the signal from the chip here , and I ' m showing you for the block of retroviral oligos.
First of all , I ' ll tell you that a little automated prediction told us it was very similar to a mouse virus.
Its closest relative is , in fact , from mice , and so we would call this a xenotropic retrovirus , because it ' s infecting a species other than mice.
Is it really in the tissue ?  And I ' ll end up with this : yes.
Nothing I ' m saying here implies causality . I don ' t know.
But now it ' s a door.
This was all done by folks in the lab -- I cannot take credit for most of this.

Stew says  " Black Men Ski " 
I went to Aspen recently and stumbled into this song.
♫ Black men ski . ♫ ♫ Black men ski . ♫ ♫ Black men ski . ♫ ♫ Some kids I ' ll describe as friends ♫ ♫ say I am race-obsessed . ♫ ♫ The luxury of your opinion ♫ ♫ shows that you are blessed . ♫ ♫ See , I have poems about sunsets ♫ ♫ flowers and the rain . ♫ ♫ I ' ve read them to policemen ♫ ♫ but it was all in vain . ♫ ♫ So black men ski . ♫ ♫ Black men ski .. . ♫ elegantly.
demo,design,entertainment,gaming,technology
One of my favorite shows as a kid was  " The Six Million Dollar Man, "  and this is a little bit closer to the 240 dollar man or so , but -- At at any rate . I would normally feel very self-conscious and geeky wearing this around , but a few days ago I saw one world-renowned statistician swallowing swords on stage here , so I figure it ' s OK amongst this group.
And at the time I didn ' t think much about it , but then later , I realized that that was the high point of my education.
But I started getting very interested in Maria Montessori and her methods , and the way she went about things , and the way she thought it very valuable for kids to kind of discover things on their own rather than being taught these things overtly.
And I really kind of want them to be presented in a way to where kids can kind of explore and discover their own principles.
And then Drake ' s Equation , which is looking at the probability of life arising on planets , how long it might last , how many planets are out there , stuff like that.
Things where you might trip across things like the Copernican Principle , the Fermi Paradox , the Anthropic Principle , the origin of life.
It ' s getting pretty close to finished now.
So here we are , at a very microscopic scale , swimming around . And I actually realize that cells don ' t have eyes , but it helps to make it cute.
Now , we actually play through many generations here , at the cellular scale.
One thing we noticed with  " The Sims, "  which is a game I did earlier , is that players love making stuff.
OK , well , we fight.
We didn ' t want to replay actual evolution with humans and all that , because it ' s almost more interesting to look at alternate possibilities in evolution.
But basically , this is the editor where we ' re going to design the next generation of our creature . So it has a little spine.
So , for instance , I might put some limbs on the character here.
Here , I ' ll give it one eye in the middle , maybe scale it up a bit . Point it down.
But really the goal here was , within about a minute , I wanted somebody to replicate what typically takes a pictorial artist several weeks to create.
OK , so that ' s the complete model . Now we can actually go to the painting phase.
And then we can test it out , once we ' ve done that , and see how it would move around.
how it might show emotions , how it might fight.
Now again , the empathy that the players have when they create the content is tremendous . Now , when players create content in this game , it ' s automatically sent up to a server and then redistributed to all the other players transparently.
But I ' m going to skip way ahead here . Now , normally what would happen is these creatures would work their way up , eventually become intelligent.
Now really , in some sense , I want the players to be building this world in their imagination , and then extracting it from them with the least amount of pain.
So far the entire game has been played on the surface of this little world here.
This world was actually extracted from the player ' s imagination.
And most games kind of put the player in the role of Luke Skywalker , this protagonist playing through this story.
In fact , I can look over here , and this is kind of a little simplified food web that ' s going on with the creatures.
Now also with this phase , we ' re getting more and more God-like powers for the player , and you can kind of experiment with this planet again as a toy.
I can also play with the dynamics of this world over time.
And our cities are going to be at risk too , because a lot of these are coastal cities.
So at first what we ' re going to see is a global ocean rise here on this little toy planet , but then over time -- I can speed it up just a little bit -- we ' ll actually see the heat impact of that as well.
Now here , our entire oceans are evaporating off the surface , and as it keeps getting hotter at some point the entire planet ' s going to melt down.
Because it ' s so hard for people to think 50 or 100 years out , but when you can give them a toy , and they can experience these long-term dynamics in just a few minutes , I think it ' s an entirely different kind of point of view , where we ' re actually mapping , using the game to re-map our intuition.
Let ' s fly to another one.
Here it is , some indigenous life down here.
You see , now they ' ve actually gone to tribal dynamics.
I think I ' ll leave before they get hostile.
One of the things that always frustrated me a little bit about astronomy when I was a kid is how it was always presented so two-dimensionally and so static . As we pull away from the star here , we ' re actually going now out into interstellar space , and we ' re getting a sense of the space around our home star.
But these are the things that we can kind of put in this little galaxy here.
But we also have stars and things as well.
Chris was wondering what kind of gods that the players would become.
You might be a networking god , building alliances , which you can also do in the game , or just curious , going around and wanting to explore as much as you possibly can.
And so that ' s why I think , personally , that toys can change the world.

So how many of you are sort of making yourselves smaller ? 
I see you.
You know , we ' re interested in , like , you know — — an awkward interaction , or a smile , or a contemptuous glance , or maybe a very awkward wink , or maybe even something like a handshake.
So obviously when we think about nonverbal behavior , or body language -- but we call it nonverbals as social scientists -- it ' s language , so we think about communication.
And there ' s a lot of reason to believe that this is a valid way to look at this . So social scientists have spent a lot of time looking at the effects of our body language , or other people ' s body language , on judgments.
So it doesn ' t have to do so much with whether or not that physician was incompetent , but do we like that person and how they interacted ? 
We tend to forget , though , the other audience that ' s influenced by our nonverbals , and that ' s ourselves.
I became especially interested in nonverbal expressions of power and dominance.
So you make yourself big , you stretch out , you take up space , you ' re basically opening up.
And this one is especially interesting because it really shows us how universal and old these expressions of power are.
So the arms up in the V , the chin is slightly lifted.
And this is what happens when you put together high and low power . So what we tend to do when it comes to power is that we complement the other ' s nonverbals.
So you have people who are like caricatures of alphas , really coming into the room , they get right into the middle of the room before class even starts , like they really want to occupy space.
You see it on their faces and their bodies , and they sit in their chair and they make themselves tiny , and they go like this when they raise their hand.
So women are much more likely to do this kind of thing than men.
You get these equally qualified women and men coming in and then you get these differences in grades , and it seems to be partly attributable to participation.
So we know that our nonverbals govern how other people think and feel about us . There ' s a lot of evidence.
So it goes both ways . When it comes to power , it also goes both ways . So when you feel powerful , you ' re more likely to do this , but it ' s also possible that when you pretend to be powerful , you are more likely to actually feel powerful.
So what do the minds of the powerful versus the powerless look like ? 
So there are a lot of differences . They take more risks.
So what does that mean ?  When you think about power , people tended to think only about testosterone , because that was about dominance.
So we know that in primate hierarchies , if an alpha needs to take over , if an individual needs to take over an alpha role sort of suddenly , within a few days , that individual ' s testosterone has gone up significantly and his cortisol has dropped significantly.
So this is what we did . We decided to bring people into the lab and run a little experiment , and these people adopted , for two minutes , either high-power poses or low-power poses , and I ' m just going to show you five of the poses , although they took on only two.
Here are a couple more.
This one is very low-power.
We then ask them ,  " How powerful do you feel ?  "  on a series of items , and then we give them an opportunity to gamble , and then we take another saliva sample.
Here ' s what we find on testosterone.
So two minutes lead to these hormonal changes that configure your brain to basically be either assertive , confident and comfortable , or really stress-reactive , and , you know , feeling sort of shut down . And we ' ve all had the feeling , right ? 
So this is in the lab . It ' s this little task , you know , it ' s just a couple of minutes . Where can you actually apply this ?  Which we cared about , of course.
So we published these findings , and the media are all over it , and they say , Okay , so this is what you do when you go in for the job interview , right ? 
It ' s you talking to yourself . What do you do before you go into a job interview ?  You do this.
So we bring people into a lab , and they do either high- or low-power poses again , they go through a very stressful job interview.
People hate this . It ' s what Marianne LaFrance calls  " standing in social quicksand. " 
They ' re blind to the hypothesis . They ' re blind to the conditions.
It ' s about the presence that they ' re bringing to the speech.
They bring their ideas , but as themselves , with no , you know , residue over them.
I don ' t want to get there and then still feel like a fraud.
When I was 19 , I was in a really bad car accident.
So I ' m taken out of college , I keep trying to go back.
So I felt entirely powerless . I worked and worked and worked , and I got lucky , and worked , and got lucky , and worked.
And the night before my first-year talk , and the first-year talk at Princeton is a 20-minute talk to 20 people . That ' s it.
You are going to fake it.
So at the end of my first year at Harvard , a student who had not talked in class the entire semester , who I had said ,  " Look , you ' ve gotta participate or else you ' re going to fail, "  came into my office . I really didn ' t know her at all.
I don ' t feel that anymore , but she does , and I get that feeling.
And tomorrow you ' re going to fake it , you ' re going to make yourself powerful , and , you know , you ' re gonna —  "   " And you ' re going to go into the classroom , and you are going to give the best comment ever. " 
And so I want to say to you , don ' t fake it till you make it.
So this is two minutes.
Get your testosterone up . Get your cortisol down.
I don ' t have ego involved in this.
Starting with the simple tale of an ant , philosopher Dan Dennett unleashes a devastating salvo of ideas , making a powerful case for the existence of memes -- concepts that are literally alive.
How many Creationists do we have in the room ? 
You know spiderwebs ?  Sure , they are products of evolution.
And yet people are interestingly resistant to the idea of applying evolutionary thinking to thinking -- to our thinking.
What is this ant doing ?  What is this in aid of ? 
Well then , why is it doing this ? 
It ' s a parasitic brain worm that has to get into the stomach of a sheep or a cow in order to continue its life cycle.
Pretty scary.
Well , it ' s ideas -- not worms -- that hijack our brains.
There are a lot of ideas to die for.
And many for Catholicism . And many for Islam.
It was a term of abuse , in effect.
Hosts work hard to spread these ideas to others.
The secret of happiness is : Find something more important than you are and dedicate your life to it.
It ' s not maximizing the number of grandchildren we have.
Well , how are we going to think about this ? 
Well , many theories . But how could something tie them together ? 
Well , you see , it ' s not his . Yes -- he started it.
Actually , I think we ' re all responsible for not just the intended effects of our ideas , but for their likely misuses.
So we have to keep plugging away , trying to correct the misapprehensions so that only the benign and useful variants of our ideas continue to spread.
That ' s what Richard said , back in  ' 93.
A virus is a string of nucleic acid with attitude.
Not silicon.
I say ,  " Well , do words exist ?  Are they in your ontology ?  " 
Remember the Shakers ?  Gift to be simple ? 
Not just the priests . Everybody.
And there were lots of widows and orphans , people like that , who needed a foster home.
The idea being passed on through proselytizing , instead of through the gene line.
There are other parasites that do this -- which render the host sterile.
I ' ve not time to go into more of it.
And we ' re doing it again.
But among all those ideas that inevitably flow out into the whole world thanks to our technology , are a lot of toxic ideas.
These memes are spreading around the world and they are wiping out whole cultures.
We have an immunity to all of the junk that lies around the edges of our culture.
But we should recognize that for many people in the world , they are a big deal.
That is not the job of the science of memetics.
But the way to deal with that is to do science , and understand how it spreads and why in a morally neutral perspective.
And , as with germs , the trick is not to try to annihilate them.
That ' s all the time I have , so thank you very much for your attention.

There has to be , between me and the orchestra , an unshakable bond of trust , born out of mutual respect , through which we can spin a musical narrative that we all believe in.
We now have a more democratic view and way of making music -- a two-way street.
It ' s silent gesture.
I have to trust the orchestra , and , even more crucially , I have to trust myself.
You end up like some kind of rabid windmill.
Bugger me , they wouldn ' t give it to me.
If you hold it too loosely , it flies away. " 
So I went out there , and I auditioned , mainly in rural township locations , right around the country.
Now you can imagine what this knowledge did to the temperature in the room , the general atmosphere.
Simply through singing.
One of them was  " Carmen. " 
I want to play you a tiny clip of it now for no other reason than to give you proof positive that there is nothing tiny about South African music making.
They don ' t read music.
Now those of us that live in the West , if I can use that term , I think have a much more hidebound attitude or sense of music -- that somehow it ' s all about skill and systems.
But how many of you would be able to make a confident assertion about a piece of classical music ? 
Did you know that TED is a tune ? 
Well ladies and gentlemen , there ' s a time-honored system , which composers have been using for hundreds of years , which proves actually that it does.
Now that piece of music that we played at the start of this session had enshrined in its heart the theme , which is TED.
Okay , we ' ll play it for you again now , and we ' re going to highlight , we ' re going to poke out the T , E , D.
Ladies and gentlemen , it ' s nearly time for tea.
Will you have a go for me ? 
And look , if you ' re adventurous , you go up the octave.
There I am like a bloody windmill again , you see.
You won ' t make the key otherwise.
The youngest of my children was born with cerebral palsy , which as you can imagine , if you don ' t have an experience of it yourself , is quite a big thing to take on board.
So I find myself asking : where is music in all of this ? 
It ' s called Paraorchestra.
Normally when you improvise -- and I do it all the time around the world -- there ' s this initial period of horror , like everyone ' s too frightened to throw the hat into the ring , an awful pregnant silence.
Now in this room with these four disabled musicians , within five minutes a rapt listening , a rapt response and some really insanely beautiful music.
Can I do that one again ? 
There ' s so much joy and things I could get from playing an instrument and performing.
If any of you thinks you want to help me in any way to achieve what is a fairly impossible and implausible dream still at this point , please let me know.
They weren ' t allowed to stay there anymore ; they had to be returned to Vienna -- as I say , an unfeasibly long way away in those days.
And we ' re going to play just the very tail end of this symphony now.
Where there is no trust , the music quite simply withers away.

And it had fuzzy zebras walking across the stomach , and Mount Kilimanjaro and Mount Meru were kind of right across the chest , that were also fuzzy.
And I was so humiliated and mortified that I immediately ran home to my mother and chastised her for ever letting me wear the hideous sweater.
And I ' m thinking , no , this is not possible.
I also tell it because it tells a larger contextual story of what aid is and can be.
Not to say that it shouldn ' t have , but that we have to get better at answering the questions that need to be considered when we think about consequences and responses.
And because we had a good business model , we actually did it , and I watched these women transform on a micro-level.
The women made their own decisions at the end of the day as to how they would use this access to credit to build their little businesses , earn more income so they could take care of their families better.
In fact , it became the largest rehabilitation lender in the country.
It ' s thrilling.
If we do that , we really can make poverty history.
Because we too often talk about them as these strong , huge masses of people yearning to be free , when in fact , it ' s quite an amazing story.
Where we typically work , there ' s people making between one and three dollars a day.
They are domestics.
One is in India , where there are 240 million farmers , most of whom make less than two dollars a day.
What he did was see what was happening in Israel , larger approaches , and figure out how to do a drip irrigation , which is a way of bringing water directly to the plant stock.
This family , Sarita and her husband , bought a 15-dollar unit when they were living in a -- literally a three-walled lean-to with a corrugated iron roof.
And I swear , you could see the future in that woman ' s eyes.
300 to 500 million cases are reported.
The question , though , is not  " Why can ' t we ?  " 
Three : this is a good road in -- right near where our factory is located.
Today , three years later , the company has employed another thousand women.
We hope to have seven million at the end of next year.
We ' re looking at building on some of the most precious resources of Africa : people.
She runs two of the lines , and has already saved enough money to put a down payment on her house.
She brought 10 of the women with whom she interacts together to see if she could sell these nets , five dollars apiece , despite the fact that people say nobody will buy one , and we learned a lot about how you sell things.
Children can sleep through the night ; the house looks beautiful ; you hang them in the window.
I want to end just by saying that there ' s enormous opportunity to make poverty history.
And so I urge all of you to think next time as to how to engage with this notion and this opportunity that we all have -- to make poverty history -- by really becoming part of the process and moving away from an us-and-them world , and realizing that it ' s about all of us , and the kind of world that we , together , want to live in and share.

To the second son , he left a third of the camels , and to the youngest son , he left a ninth of the camels.
It doesn ' t divide by nine.
So then they had 18 camels.
You get 17.
They start off like 17 camels -- no way to resolve it.
We ' re all one family.
How do we deal with our deepest differences , given the human propensity for conflict and the human genius at devising weapons of enormous destruction ? 
It ' s actually surprisingly simple.
The secret to peace is us.
I was curious about them and about the way in which they resolve conflict.
Well what I learned is whenever tempers rise in those communities , someone goes and hides the poison arrows out in the bush , and then everyone sits around in a circle like this , and they sit , and they talk , and they talk.
That system , I call the  " third side. " 
Perhaps the most fundamental way in which the third side can help is to remind the parties of what ' s really at stake.
Human beings -- we ' re reaction machines.
Let me tell you a little story from my own negotiating experience.
And the talks got off to a rather rocky start when the vice president of Chechnya began by pointing at the Russians and said ,  " You should stay right here in your seats , because you ' re going to be on trial for war crimes. " 
I started reacting , but then I tried to remember to go to the balcony.
The conversation got back on track.
How could we possibly go to the balcony ? 
Just out of curiosity , how many of you ? 
Is it the number of deaths ? 
Stories matter . As an anthropologist , I know that.
Stories are the key.
What would that mean ?  What is the story there ? 
That man , of course , was Abraham.
His basic message was unity too , the interconnectedness of it all , the unity of it all , and his basic value was respect , was kindness toward strangers.
Now how would you -- now think about that for a moment.
What ' s the opposite of terrorism ? 
How would you bring that story to life ? 
And that ' s what comes to the first step here.
Because walking has a real power.
But if I walk shoulder-to-shoulder , even touching shoulders , it ' s no problem.
People said ,  " That ' s crazy . You can ' t.
And so we studied the idea at Harvard.
Then we crossed the border into Syria , went to Aleppo , which , turns out , is named after Abraham.
We showed it could be done . It was an amazing journey.
That ' s the essence of the Abraham path.
He ' s alive ; he ' s a living presence.
Men , women , young people , old people -- more women than men , actually , interestingly.
In Sao Paulo , Brazil , it ' s become an annual event for thousands of people to run in a virtual Abraham Path Run , uniting the different communities.
Last month , there was a piece in the Guardian , in the Manchester Guardian , about it -- two whole pages.
And so that ' s what it ' s about.
She ' s partially blind , her husband can ' t work , she ' s got seven kids.
She makes the most delicious food that ' s fresh from the herbs in the surrounding countryside.
There are literally hundreds of those kinds of communities across the Middle East , across the path.
Let me just show you one thing.
What would the oak tree look like ? 
So my question is , if it can be done in Europe , why not in the Middle East ? 
It was done in South Africa.
It depends on us taking the third side.
That ' s a third side act.
One is , the secret to peace is the third side.
If we ' re able to unite our third-side webs of peace , we can even halt the lion of war.

Robert Fischell on medical inventing
At the present time , it takes an average of three hours after the first symptoms of a heart attack are recognized by the patient , before that patient arrives at an emergency room.
About half of them , 600,000 , have permanent damage to their heart that will cause them to have very bad problems later on.
What are we going to do about them ?  How can we save their lives ? 
That , ladies and gentlemen , is a heart attack.
And when it goes beep , beep , beep , you better do something about it , because if you want to live you have to get to some medical treatment.
Well , with the pig , at the baseline , before we blocked the pig ' s artery to simulate a heart attack , that was the signal.
Second of all , I ' ll bet even you people who are untrained can see the difference , and we see here an ST segment elevation right after this sharp line.
Then we tried it with my son , Dr . Tim Fischell , we tried it on some human patients who had to have a stent put in.
And if we had a computer that could detect it , we could tell you you ' re having a heart attack so early it could save your life and prevent congestive heart failure.
What does the system look like ? 
And the EXD is an External Device that you can have on your night table.
And when you go to the farmyard , you can ' t easily get pigs to have heart attacks , so we said , well , we ' re experts in stents.
That ' s not very nice , but , after all , we had to find out what the answer is.
But look what happened at 10:06 after we removed this pig ' s medication that kept him from having a heart attack.
What happens after you have the heart attack , this blockage ? 
Well , because of the FDA , we didn ' t save the pig ' s life , because we need to do this type of animal research for humans.
Well , you feel some chest pain or indigestion.
You wait as burns and other critical patients are treated , because 75 percent of the patients who go to an emergency room with chest pains don ' t have AMI , so you ' re not taken very seriously.
So we developed the AngelMed Guardian System and we have a device inside this patient , called the Implanted AngelMed Guardian.
And the person who ' s there , the medical practitioner , calls you -- this is also a cell phone -- and says ,  " Mr . Smith , you ' re in deep doo-doo ; you have a problem.
That ' s the first invention that I wanted to describe.
Now , you ' re probably very few physicists here.
The patients who have a migraine preceded by an aura have a band of excited neurons -- that ' s shown in red -- that moves at three to five millimeters a minute towards the mid-brain.
Weighs about 70 pounds , has a wire about an inch in diameter.
And that ' s a fully developed visual aura , as we see on top.
That means that the magnetic pulse is generating an electric current that ' s interfering with the erroneous electrical activity in the brain.
Anchor : For anyone who suffers from migraine headaches -- and there are 30 million Americans who do -- tonight : a possible answer.
It may look silly or even frightening as you walk around with it in your purse , but researchers here in Ohio organizing clinical trials for this migraine zapper , say it is scientifically sound -- that , in fact , when the average person gets a migraine , it ' s caused by something similar to an electrical impulse.
Experts say the research has actually been around for more than a decade , and more long-term studies need to be done . Christina now swears by it.
You see , the problem is , 30 million Americans have migraine headaches , and we need a means to treat it , and I think that we now have it.
And auras can be erased and the migraine , then , does not occur.
Now , why do we use -- add on , nearly , an epileptic focus ? 
We thought we could adapt it for the brain.
This is probably a better picture.
And then with four screws , we put in a frame , then we snap in the device and we run with wires -- the one shown in green will go to the surface of the brain with electrodes , to the epileptic focus , the origin of the epilepsy , where we can sense the electrical signal and have computer analysis that tells us when to hit it with some electrical current to prevent the clinical manifestation of the seizure.
The advantages of responsive neurostimulation : It can detect and terminate seizures before the clinical symptoms occur , provide stimulation only when needed , can be turned off if seizures disappear ; it has minimal side effects -- as a matter of fact , in all our clinical trials to date , we ' ve seen no side effects in the 40 or so patients in whom it ' s been implanted -- and it ' s invisible , cosmetically hidden , so , if you have epilepsy and you have the device , no one will know it because you can ' t tell that it ' s there.
I have three wishes . Well , I can ' t do much about Africa.
Then you saw what that device looked like , that the woman was using to fix her migraines ? 
Then we ' re going to challenge the TED attendees to come up with a way to improve health care in the USA , where we have problems that Africa doesn ' t have.
In other words , if you ' ve screwed up electrical signals , maybe , by putting other electrical signals from a computer in the brain , we can counteract that.
And Mr . Fischer , and his group at NeuroPace , and myself believe that we can have a dramatic effect in improving OCD in America and in the world.
The present portable device is far from optimally designed , both as to human factors as appearance.
And , of the 100,000-dollar prize money , that TED was so generous to give me , I am donating 50,000 dollars to the NeuroPace people to get on with the treatment of OCD , obsessive-compulsive disorder , and I ' m making another 50,000 available for a company to optimize the design of the device for migraines.
Lawyers take cases on contingency with the hope of a big share of a big settlement by a sympathetic jury , because this patient really ended up badly.
I have a couple of ideas to begin with.
What do you think someone has at the end of reading 12 single-spaced pages ? 
Everybody knows that we can do better with a visual thing that can be interactive with the patient , where they see the video and they ' re being videoed and they press , do you understand this ?  No , I don ' t.
And that is one of the ideas.
However , if a video is there that everything was explained to you , and you have it all in the video file , it ' ll be much less likely that some hotshot lawyer will take this case on contingency , because it won ' t be nearly as good a case.
And , so there , that ' s the end of all my wishes.

A year and a half ago , four of the five people who are full time members at Ushahidi , which means  " testimony "  in Swahili , were TED Fellows.
We got reports like this.
But then we decided we needed to do something more.
We ' re building for smartphones , so that it can be used in the developed world , as well as the developing world.
It ' s now been deployed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
I ' m here to talk about the next big thing , because what we ' re finding out is that we have this capacity to report eyewitness accounts of what ' s going on in real time.
How do you decide what is important ? 
What we are looking at is the first three hours.
So what we built of course , Ushahidi , is crowdsourcing this information.
So we think that there is something interesting we can do here.
And by rating it and by rating the different people who submit information , we can get refined results and weighted results.
From young , smart developers.

Lakshmi Pratury on letter-writing
It ' s inevitable , terrible , but really what I want to talk about is , I ' m just fascinated by the legacy people leave when they die.
And my father left me a legacy of his handwriting through letters and a notebook.
Handwriting is a disappearing art.
But too late.
If a fraction of this powerful TED audience could be inspired to buy a beautiful paper -- John , it ' ll be a recycled one -- and write a beautiful letter to someone they love , we actually may start a revolution where our children may go to penmanship classes.
As I witnessed my father ' s body being swallowed by fire , I sat by his funeral pyre and wrote.
I took it out for the first time to come here.
http://www.ted.com/talks/richard_baraniuk_on_open_source_learning.html
Richard Baraniuk on open-source learning
Does anybody remember these ? 
What ' s happened in the music world is there ' s a culture or an ecosystem that ' s been created that , if you take some words from Apple , the catchphrase that we create , rip , mix and burn.
And what that ' s done is it ' s created , like I said , a vibrant community that ' s very inclusive with people continually working to connect musical ideas , innovate them and keep things constantly up to date.
In particular , textbooks and the kind of educational materials that we use every day in school.
And this is even more true if you happen to speak a language other than one of the world ' s major languages , and especially English.
So , the first thing I ' d like you to do is a little thought experiment.
Think of it as a massive iTunes for book type content.
So , imagine we could do that and imagine we could put people into this.
Over the last six-and-a-half years , we ' ve been working really hard at Rice University on a project called Connexions , and so what I ' d like to do for the rest of the talk is just tell you a little bit about what people are doing with Connexions , which you can kind of think of as the counterpoint to Nicholas Negroponte ' s talk yesterday , where they ' re working on the hardware of bringing education to the world.
Well , the first thing is there ' s a community of engineering professors , from Cambridge to Kyoto , who are developing engineering content in electrical engineering to develop what you can think of as a massive , super textbook that covers the entire area of electrical engineering -- and not only that , it can be customized for use in each of their own individual institutions.
In fact , a lot of this use coming from Unites States , K-through-12 schools because anyone who ' s involved in a school scale back , the first thing that ' s cut is the music curriculum and so this is just indicating the tremendous thirst for this kind of open , free content.
People , volunteers and even companies that are translating material into Asian languages like Chinese , Japanese and Thai , to spread the knowledge even further.
We ' ve been working with Teachers Without Borders who are very interested in mixing our materials.
It ' s a new university in California , in the Central Valley , working very closely with community colleges.
And we ' ve also been working with a number of other organizations.
And I think a lot of you received , I think all of you received one of these music books in your gift pack.
This costs , anybody guess ? 
Why does it cost 22 dollars ? 
And I think that this is an extraordinarily interesting area because there is tremendous area under this long tail in publishing.
There is tremendous sustaining revenue under this long tail to sustain open projects like ours , but also to sustain this new emergence of on-demand publishers , like Coop , who produced these two books.
There ' s tons of technology , and the only piece of technology that I really want to talk about is XML.
Remember we took the book , tore the pages out ? 
It gives you the ability to personalize the learning experience to each individual student , so that every student can have a book or a course that ' s customized to their learning style , their context , their language and the things that excite them.
And my day job , as Chris said , I ' m an electrical engineering professor.
And people who are teachers out here , whoever taught , you know this -- it ' s the interconnections between ideas that teaching is really all about.
The same type of mark-up , like mathML , for chemistry.
Even the three wise men.
And we would be accused of pirates for doing that , because this music has been propertized.
So , what we have to do is get it right from the very beginning and what we have to do is find an intellectual property framework that makes sharing safe , and makes it easily understandable , and the inspiration here is taken from open-source software , things like Linux and the GPL.
At the bottom of every piece of material in Connexions and in lots of other projects , you can find their logo.
We ' re not talking about Harry Potter , right ? 
So I ' d like to conclude with just the last few points.
How do we protect it into the future ? 
It didn ' t take long until people started contributing materials , for example , on lingerie , which is actually a pretty good module.
Because Chris and his team have ensured that things are very , very high quality , right , and so we need to be able to do the same thing.
Connexions and open content is all about sharing knowledge.
Nicholas Negroponte , founder of the MIT Media Laboratory , describes how the One Laptop Per Child project will build and distribute the  " $100 laptop. " 
I ' ve been at MIT for 44 years . I went to TED I.
I didn ' t quit the Media Lab ; I stepped down as chairman -- which was a kind of ridiculous title , but someone else has taken it on , and one of the things you can do as a professor , is you stay on as a professor.
Now , I was asked by Chris to talk about some of the big issues , and so I figured I ' d start with the three that at least drove me to do this.
And so that isn ' t very hard.
And that is that we all in this room learned how to walk , how to talk , not by being taught how to talk , or taught how to walk , but by interacting with the world , by having certain results as a consequence of being able to ask for something , or being able to stand up and reach it.
So with those as the principles -- some of you may know Seymour Papert ; this is back in 1982 , when we were working in Senegal.
It didn ' t scale but it at least was bringing computers to developing countries , and learning pretty quickly that these kids -- even though English wasn ' t their language , the Latin alphabet barely was their language , but they could just swim like fish ; they could play these like pianos.
OK , they just use Skype.
In parallel with this , Seymour Papert got the governor of Maine to legislate one laptop per child in the year 2002.
And now , three and a half years later , guess what ? 
Screw you . Go to the back of the line and someone else will do it , and then when you figure out that this works , you can join as well.
Scale is truly important.
We ' re interested in perfect color uniformity.
And they said ,  " Oh , well maybe we could become part of your strategic plan. " 
And we ' re doing it without a sales and marketing team.
And this has been in the press a great deal.
And the fun part -- and I ' m quite focused on it -- I tell people I used to be a light bulb , but now I ' m a laser -- I ' m just going to get that thing built , and it turns out it ' s not so hard.
It gets distributed to the school system like a textbook.
It ' s the rest -- that little brown box -- that is pretty fascinating , because the rest of your laptop is devoted to itself.
And my laptop runs slower , less reliably and less pleasantly than it ever has before.
And I said , God , our laptop ' s going to go like a bat out of hell.
Now this people ask all the time what it is.
So you really can bring into a village , and then the villages can connect themselves , and you really can do it quite well.
Now , what we ' re doing is , we ' re doing one that will be both frontlit and backlit.
That ' s why a lot of our people are more or less living in Taiwan right now.
That ' s the machine we showed in Tunis.
This isn ' t a design , OK ? 
I ' m going to pass it to this handsome gentleman.
This is where when you go outside , it ' s in black and white.
I ' ll let Jim decide which way to send it afterwards . OK.
So I can ' t quite name them.
And yet we count.
It ' s really hard . And so it ' s certainly the hard road.
And since I visit each one of those countries within at least every three months , I ' m just going around the world every three weeks.
We ' re coming in probably at 135 , to start , then drift down.
The gray market ' s a big issue . And one of the ways -- just one -- but one of the ways to help in the case of the gray market is to make something that is so utterly unique.
You can spray paint it ; you can do anything you want.
Each government has a task force . This perhaps is less interesting , but we ' re trying to get the governments to all work together , and it ' s not easy.
And everybody says -- I say -- it ' s an education project.
But we are certainly constructionists.
The only criticism , and people really don ' t want to criticize this , because it is a humanitarian effort ; it is a nonprofit effort ; and to criticize it is a little bit stupid , actually.
So it ' s not a matter of whether it ' s going to happen . It is going to happen.
http://www.ted.com/talks/amber_case_we_are_all_cyborgs_now.html
Amber Case : We are all cyborgs now
Well , traditional definition is  " an organism to which exogenous components have been added for the purpose of adapting to new environments. " 
So let ' s look at the concept of traditional anthropology.
I , as a cyborg anthropologist , have suddenly said ,  " Oh , wow . Now suddenly we ' re a new form of Homo sapiens , and look at these fascinating cultures , and look at these curious rituals that everybody ' s doing around this technology.
It has helped us to extend our physical selves , go faster , hit things harder , and there ' s been a limit on that.
What does the inside of your computer actually look like ? 
Whether you like it or not , you ' re starting to show up online , and people are interacting with your second self when you ' re not there.
So , in the same way that you wake up , take a shower and get dressed , you have to learn to do that for your digital self.
So when I was little , my dad would sit me down at night and he would say ,  " I ' m going to teach you about time and space in the future. " 
I thought I was very clever.
And I said ,  " Dad , dad , dad , how do you do that ?  " 
And so , when I went to sleep for the next 10 or 20 years , I was thinking at night ,  " I want to be the first person to create a wormhole , to make things accelerate faster.
It gets adopted because people use it and it ' s made for humans.
They would click on a button , and they would be connected as A to B immediately.
One of the other ideas that comes around is that you have a different type of time on every single device that you use.
And that incites a sort of panic architecture --  " Oh no , where ' s this thing ?  " 
It ' s not that we ' re always connected to everybody , but at anytime we can connect to anyone we want.
One I ' m really worried about is that people aren ' t taking time for mental reflection anymore , and that they aren ' t slowing down and stopping , being around all those people in the room all the time that are trying to compete for their attention on the simultaneous time interfaces , paleontology and panic architecture.
And so this is very important.
But when you actually visualize it , all the connections that we ' re doing right now -- this is an image of the mapping of the Internet -- it doesn ' t look technological.
It ' s that they ' re helping us to be more human , helping us to connect with each other.
We ' re just increasing our humanness and our ability to connect with each other , regardless of geography.
brain,cognitive science,neuroscience,science,youth
Back then , 15 years ago , we didn ' t have the ability to look inside the living human brain and track development across the lifespan.
So adolescence is defined as the period of life that starts with the biological , hormonal , physical changes of puberty and ends at the age at which an individual attains a stable , independent role in society.
Prefrontal cortex is an interesting brain area.
So if you look at gray matter volume , for example , gray matter volume across age from age four to 22 years increases during childhood , which is what you can see on this graph . It peaks in early adolescence.
You can think of it a bit like pruning a rosebush.
So in my lab , we ' re interested in the social brain , that is the network of brain regions that we use to understand other people and to interact with other people.
So you don ' t have to ask any of these guys.
This region is more active in adolescents when they make these social decisions and think about other people than it is in adults , and this is actually a meta-analysis of nine different studies in this area from labs around the world , and they all show the same thing , that activity in this medial prefrontal cortex area decreases during the period of adolescence.
Now , there are objects on these shelves , on some of them , and you ' ll notice there ' s a guy standing behind the set of shelves , and there are some objects that he can ' t see.
Now your task is to move objects around.
They move the white truck instead of the blue truck.
Okay , so if I just show you the percentage errors in a large developmental study we did , this is in a study ranging from age seven to adulthood , and what you ' re going to see is the percentage errors in the adult group in both conditions , so the gray is the director condition , and you see that our intelligent adults are making errors about 50 percent of the time , whereas they make far fewer errors when there ' s no director present , when they just have to remember that rule of ignoring the gray background.
So if you have a teenage son or a daughter and you sometimes think they have problems taking other people ' s perspectives , you ' re right . They do . And this is why.
So , he said ,  " Before puberty , if my two daughters were messing around in a shop , I ' d say ,  ' Hey , stop messing around and I ' ll sing your favorite song, '  and instantly they ' d stop messing around and he ' d sing their favorite song . After puberty , that became the threat.
And actually , the answer is probably not . There are lots of descriptions of adolescence in history that sound very similar to the descriptions we use today.
So for example , take risk-taking . We know that adolescents have a tendency to take risks . They do.
It gives you the kick out of taking risks.
And that ' s still the case for many , many teenagers around the world today . Forty percent of teenagers don ' t have access to secondary school education.
It actually reflects changes in the brain that provide an excellent opportunity for education and social development . Thank you.

And you stop , and you get out of your car and you take a picture.
HIV isn ' t like other medical conditions ; it ' s stigmatizing.
This map depicts the global distribution of HIV.
There are 1.4 million pregnant women in low- and middle-income countries living with HIV and of these , 90 percent are in sub-Saharan Africa.
But you go to Rwanda -- a very small country -- 8,000 mothers with HIV who are pregnant.
I think there ' s an assumption amongst most people in the public that if a mother is HIV-positive , she ' s going to infect her child.
So these programs -- and I ' m going to refer to PMTCT though my talk -- these prevention programs , simply , they ' re the tests and the drugs that we give to mothers to prevent them from infecting their babies , and also the medicines we give to mothers to keep them healthy and alive to raise their children.
It ' s an entire package of services , and it works.
It means 1,100 children infected each day -- 1,100 children each day , infected with HIV.
100 come from Asia and the Pacific.
And here , again , we see Africa has a disproportionate share of the numbers of doctors.
That means doctors and nurses simply don ' t have the time to take care of patients.
Well , fortunately since 2001 , we ' ve got new treatments , new tests , and we ' re far more successful , but we don ' t have any more nurses.
This is a picture of a maternal health clinic in Africa -- mothers coming , pregnant and with their babies.
I ' m a doctor -- I tell people things to do , and I expect them to follow my guidance -- because I ' m a doctor ; I went to Harvard -- but the reality is , if I tell a patient ,  " You should have safer sex.
So , I want to tell you a story -- I want to take you on a little trip.
And the nurse takes you into a room , and she tells you about the tests and HIV and the medicines you can take and how to take care of yourself and your baby , and you hear none of it.
And this -- this is the face and story of HIV in Africa today.
The door opens and there ' s a room full of mothers , mothers with babies , and they ' re sitting , and they ' re talking , they ' re listening.
We ' re all HIV-positive.
Mothers take care of the children , take care of the home.
We bring mothers who have HIV , who ' ve been through these PMTCT programs in the very facilities , to come back and work side by side with doctors and nurses as part of the health care team.
But if you wanted to understand what that surgery would do to your life , you ' d like to engage someone , someone who ' s had the procedure.
They ' re hired -- they ' re paid as professional members of the health care teams , just like doctors and nurses.
But so often , they only get trained once , so they ' re not aware of new medicines , new guidelines as they come out.
Our organization has three goals.
So how do we do it ? 
Men are not frequently part of pregnancy care.
And this is so important in breaking through the stigma.
We also work in groups.
If we can change the way households believe and think , we can change the way communities believe and think.
We have the medicines , we have the tests , but how do you reduce the stigma ? 
And so the mentor mother went along with.
I ' m HIV-positive.
I thought you were going to throw me out of the family. " 
And there they were , all of them together for the first time being able to share this experience for the first time and to support each other for the first time.
I am proof that there is hope.
So we talk in terms of what we call task-shifting.
How do you build a better health care system ? 
So we go back to the prevention of mother to child transmission.
Our organization works on three levels.
They change the way communities think -- we need to change attitudes to HIV.
Our health care systems are broken.
I started the program in Capetown , South Africa back in 2001.
That is 20 percent of the global HIV-positive pregnant women -- 20 percent of the world.
And empowerment through employment -- reducing stigma.
Those who are HIV-infected must know how to take care of themselves.
Mothers caring for mothers.
11-year-old Birke Baehr presents his take on a major source of our food -- far-away and less-than-picturesque industrial farms . Keeping farms out of sight promotes a rosy , unreal picture of big-box agriculture , he argues , as he outlines the case to green and localize food production.
Hello . My name is Birke Baehr , and I ' m 11 years old.
Little kids , especially , are attracted by colorful packaging and plastic toys.
I began to look into this stuff on the Internet , in books and in documentary films , in my travels with my family.
Don ' t get me wrong , I like fish and tomatoes , but this is just creepy.
Did you know rats that ate genetically engineered corn had developed signs of liver and kidney toxicity ? 
And don ' t even get me started on the Confined Animal Feeding Operations called CAFOS.
When it rains , these chemicals seep into the ground , or run off into our waterways , poisoning our water too.
I discovered that there ' s a movement for a better way.
And that way I can have a greater impact on the world.
And so for that , he ' s called crazy by the system.
Now I know definitely which one I would choose.
I want you to know that there are farmers '  markets in every community popping up.
He asked him if he wanted organic Toasted O ' s or the sugarcoated flakes -- you know , the one with the big striped cartoon character on the front.

And I thought that there was -- I thought that there was absolutely no way in hell to top that.
First of all , please remember I ' m completely politically correct , and I mean everything with great affection.
So , one of the questions I ask myself is , was this the most distressing TED ever ? 
Images of the earth being wiped out by flood or bird flu : 64 percent.
It ' s going to be a cradle-to-cradle scream bag , of course.
So Robert Wright -- I don ' t know , I felt like if there was anyone that Helen needed to give antidepressants to , it might have been him.
Business class morality is , don ' t bomb Japan -- they built my car.
All right , now these are the wha -- I ' d say , [mumble , mumble -- mumble , mumble , mumble , mumble , mumble] -- ahh!
And she was talking about seven-dimensional , inverted universes.
And that ' s why I went out and I picked up a best-selling business book.
And now we ' re going to have kind of a little more visualization about Rick Warren.
The scales here are religiosity from zero percent , or atheist , to 100 percent , Bible literally true.
And Rick Warren ' s kind of pulling ahead , kind of pulling ahead.
Now , one of the things that ' s very important is , I ' m sorry -- about One Laptop Per Child.
It needs to be flat , so it ' s transportable.
Has to be visible in bright daylight . Will work anywhere.
And here it is , the $100 computer.
So we ' re trying to check and trying to douse here , and see who uses marijuana.
OK , now smallpox is an extremely distressing illness.
Day two.
Day five and day six.
Now the wonderful thing is , Larry Brilliant was just appointed the head of the Google Foundation , and so he decided that he would support -- he would support Cameron ' s work.
This is a home made entirely out of Fruit Roll-Ups.
And the granola house has a special Sun Chip roof to collect water and recycle it.
So , Einstein -- Einstein , tell me -- what ' s your favorite song ? 
Could you say that again ?  What ' s your favorite singing group ? 
Could we have the sound up on the laptop , please ? 
TR : Now it ' s a little hard to hear the whole message , so I wanted to -- so I wanted to help you a little bit.
And as Jay Walker pointed out , that is just not scary enough.
And then we decided that we ' d change it from English to Dutch -- into  " Het globale Verwarmen. " 
Aquecer-se ucked-fay.
Now can you look at that carefully and see if you see the Virgin Mary ? 
So , I talked to Josh Prince-Ramus about the convention center and the conferences . It ' s getting awfully big.
And then of course , we wanted to have the simulcast lounge , the lobby and the Steinbeck forum.
So we build this building on stilts , then up here -- is where we ' re going to put the new Steinbeck auditorium.
Now I don ' t know about you , but sometimes I have these images in my head of separated at birth.
And I want you to get out a pen , and I want you to write a terrorist note.
And then I want you to throw it on Jim Young.
Now this film isn ' t really hard enough , so I wanted to make it a little bit harder.
Now I wanted to use this talk to talk about global warming a little bit.
The water level of the lake has started drying up.
And I fear , if we do nothing for our planet , in 20 years , it ' s going to look like this.
Aboard Mission Blue , scientist Greg Stone tells the story of how he helped the Republic of Kiribati create an enormous protected area in the middle of the Pacific -- protecting fish , sealife and the island nation itself.
I guess the story actually has to start maybe back in the the 1960s , when I was seven or eight years old , watching Jacques Cousteau documentaries on the living room floor with my mask and flippers on.
And I ' ve dived in deep-sea submersibles around the world.
But when I got there , I found lots of plastic garbage and other debris.
So I began to work with National Geographic Society and others and led expeditions to Antarctica.
But after three trips to Antarctica , I decided that it might be nicer to work in warmer water.
You may have seen this in other forms , but the top line is the amount of protected area on land , globally , and it ' s about 12 percent.
And I do believe that we are at the hockey stick point of the protected area in the ocean.
But scuba diving , submersibles and all the work that we ' re setting about to do here will help rectify that.
If you want to get to the Phoenix Islands , it ' s five days from Fiji , it ' s five days from Hawaii , it ' s five days from Samoa.
And I said ,  " Yeah.
Let me give you a little peek here of the Phoenix Islands-protected area.
Seamounts are important for biodiversity.
So it ' s a deep -- think about it in a big three-dimensional space , very deep three-dimensional space with herds of tuna , whales , all kinds of deep sea marine life like we ' ve seen here before.
But we got up there , and I had the unique and wonderful scientific opportunity and personal opportunity to get to a place that had never been dived and just get to an island and go ,  " Okay , where are we going to dive ? 
It was an ecosystem . Parrotfish spawning -- this is about 5,000 longnose parrotfish spawning at the entrance to one of the Phoenix Islands.
And sharks -- we had sharks on our early dives , up to 150 sharks at once , which is an indication of a very , very healthy , very strong , system.
And that ' s the area again.
And what ' s the context of the Phoenix Islands ? 
In the center we have the Phoenix Islands , which is the subject that I ' m talking about.
They control 3.4 million cubic miles of ocean , and that ' s between one and two percent of all the ocean water on the planet.
And I would tell people ,  " Why do I go to Kiribati ? 
Sea levels are rising , and Kiribati , along with 42 other nations in the world , will be under water within 50 to 100 years due to climate change and the associated sea-level rise from thermal expansion and the melting of freshwater into the ocean.
We as a world are faced with a problem.
But back to the Phoenix Islands , which is the subject of this Talk.
And for some reason they didn ' t want me to come , or it was hard to find a time and a place , and it took a while , but finally they said ,  " Okay , you can come.
So David Obura , a coral reef biologist , and I went to Tarawa , and we presented for two hours on the amazing findings of the Phoenix Islands.
He said ,  " We often issue these permits to do research in our waters , but usually we get a note two or three years later , or a reprint.
And I was free for dinner , and I went out to dinner with the Minister of Fisheries in Kiribati.
And , you know , it didn ' t seem like a very good deal to me.
So I said ,  " Yes , a  ' reverse fishing license. '  "  So we walked away from this dinner really not knowing where to go at that point.
And Conservation International had struck some of those deals.
Halfway through this process , I met the president of Kiribati , President Anote Tong.
Secondly , I ' d like you to create principles that will transcend my own presidency.
And it was primarily because Kiribati realized that this was in their own self-interest to do this.
The ocean heated up as it does sometimes , and the hot spot formed and stalled right over the Phoenix Islands for six months.
Well , the good news is it ' s recovered and recovering fast , faster than any reef we ' ve seen.
It ' s the only threat , the only influence that the reef had to deal with.
And it certainly was.
We just had our first PIPA Trust Board meeting three weeks ago.
So the conditions for success here are listed.
And I ' ll leave you with one final slide , that is : how do we scale this up ? 
And as you can see , we have a patchwork across this ocean.
http://www.ted.com/talks/stefan_sagmeister_shares_happy_design.html
Stefan Sagmeister shares happy design
So the plane landed in between the buildings and got to a full stop in front of this little billboard.
And I flew back to Austria , packed my bags , and , another week later , I was again on my way to Hong Kong still superstitions and thinking ,  " Well , if that  ' Winner '  billboard is still up , I ' m going to have a good time working here.
However , I did have a number of real moments of happiness in my life -- of , you know , I think what the conference brochure refers to as  " moments that take your breath away. " 
What I did do , though is , I actually looked at them from a design standpoint and just eliminated all the ones that had nothing to do with design.
And I ' ll just give you one example . I had gotten my first Walkman.
So you could drive up into the mountains freely blasting The Police on the new Sony Walkman.
Now , there is the other part , from a designer ' s standpoint -- if you ' re happy while actually doing it.
and , I think , particularly , the Swiss  , don ' t seem to be doing all that well.
And they interestingly sectioned the exhibit off into four different areas.
And there was a little -- an interesting theory about abstraction.
And , lastly , under  " Harmony, "  they had this 13th-century mandala from Tibet.
This is , you know , a book.
You know , that ' s not a big deal to accomplish.
Much , much more difficult is this , where the designs actually can evoke happiness -- and I ' m going to just show you three that actually did this for me.
Met every Wednesday at a subway stop with 20 of his friends.
So you ' re you ' re really bored in the subway , and you kind of stare at something.
He didn ' t want any of his friends to be arrested , so he supplied everybody with this fake volunteer card.
Opens up at dusk and dawn every day.
People ' s demeanor changes when they go in there.
But my last project is , again , from a young designer in New York.
And other people go and fill them in.
I think the reason this works so well is because everybody involved wins.
You know , one is : just working without pressure.
This is , you know , related to it : getting out of the studio.
And , just about at that time , an Austrian magazine called and asked if we would want to do six spreads -- design six spreads that work like dividing pages between the different chapters in the magazine ? 
A couple of weeks ago , a French company asked us to design five billboards for them.
We flew to Arizona -- the designer who works with me , and myself -- and photographed this one.
This is :  " Having "  -- this is the same thing ; it ' s just , you know , photographed from the side.
Then it ' s :  " always works out. " 
http://www.ted.com/talks/naif_al_mutawa_superheroes_inspired_by_islam.html
Naif Al-Mutawa : Superheroes inspired by Islam
As fascism took over Europe in the 1930s , an unlikely reaction came out of North America.
Bruce Wayne , who becomes Batman , loses his parents at the age of six in Gotham City.
Bruce Wayne is in his bedroom when a big bat flies over his head , and he sees it as an omen to become Batman.
And it ' s only by linking positive things that the negative can be delinked.
Those are basic human values.
I rewrote that story , and in my version , the librarians find out that this is going to happen -- and here ' s a side note : if you want a comic book to do well , make the librarians the hero . It always works well.
Some librarians escape , and over the course of days and weeks , they dip the stones into the Tigris and suck up that collective wisdom that we all think is lost to civilization.
The second is Columbus finally gets funded to go to India , but he gets lost.
And now it ' s 2010 , and there are 99 heroes from 99 different countries.
They said ,  " Your Highness , the scholars are cheating.
The concept centers on something called the Noor stones.
Number two , all of The 99 , when they first get their stone , or their power , abuse it ; they use it for self-interest.
Everybody believes the Koran is for all time and all place.
Now the main bad guy , Rughal , does not want these stones to update , so he ' s trying to get them to stop updating.
And the last point about the 99 Noor stones is this.
I think that ' s there in all cultures , right ? 
They work in teams of three : two boys and a girl , two girls and a boy , three boys , three girls , no problem.
So here ' s some of the characters that we have.
Now , Mumita was a fun one to name . Mumita is the destroyer.
We have Jami from Hungary , who first starts making weapons : He ' s the technology wiz.
So Al-Batina is hidden , but she ' s a superhero.
She said ,  " That ' s not me. " 
So from day one , the people involved in the project , bottom left is Fabian Nicieza , writer for X-Men and Power Rangers.
And we entered Western consciousness with a tagline :  " Next Ramadan , the world will have new heroes, "  back in 2005.
And I think I scared him -- because he basically promised me -- we had no product -- but he said ,  " We ' ll give you a paragraph in the arts section if you ' ll just go away. " 
Like I care , right ? 
You know , maybe next week , next month , next year , but , you know , it ' ll come out. " 
So flurry of phone calls and emails from The New York Times.
The good news is they ' re all holding copies of The 99 , smiling , and they found me to sign the picture.
But the biggest thing we ' ve done to date , which is just amazing , is that we ' ve done a 26-episode animated series , which is done for global audiences : in fact , we ' re already going to be in the U.S . and Turkey , we know.
They don ' t know , OK , and they ' re trying to get another member of The 99 to join them.
I need more light.
Man : I won ' t send any more commandos in until I know it ' s safe.
Jabbar : Dana , I can ' t do this without you.
You are Noora the Light.
Don ' t we deserve to be saved ?  Don ' t I ? 
Jabbar : Aaaahhh!
Dana : Miklos , that man is not your friend.
But that ' s only half the story.
Now , I ' m a clinical psychologist . I ' m licensed in New York State.
Now , one of the things that I refer to when I -- about the importance of this message -- is that I gave a lecture at the medical school at Kuwait University , where I lecture on the biological basis of behavior , and I gave the students two articles , one from The New York Times and one from New York magazine.
The second one was about a woman complaining because three minivans with six bearded men pulled up and started interrogating her on the spot for talking to a man who wasn ' t related to her.
What blew their mind was the first one took place in India , it was the party of a Hindu God.
In other words , good Hindus and good Jews don ' t act this way.
This is one of my sons , Rayan , who ' s a Scooby Doo addict.
Last summer when we were in our home in New York , he was out in the yard playing in his playhouse . And I was in my office working , and he came in ,  " Baba , I want you to come with me . I want my toy. " 
I have work to do. " 
And when I see pictures like this , of parents or uncles who think it ' s cute to have a little child holding a Koran and having a suicide bomber belt around them to protest something , the hope is by linking enough positive things to the Koran , that one day we can move this child from being proud in the way they ' re proud there , to that.
And no two people could disagree about what the word free was and what the word falafel was , behind us ,  " free falafel. "  You know.
Just today , D.C . Comics announced the cover of our upcoming crossover.
In a world like that , they ' ll always be a job for Superman and The 99.

So , visualizing information , so that we can see the patterns and connections that matter and then designing that information so it makes more sense , or it tells a story , or allows us to focus only on the information that ' s important.
That is , they ' re meaningless without context : 500 billion for this pipeline , 20 billion for this war.
So purple is  " fighting, "  and red is  " giving money away, "  and green is  " profiteering. " 
Let me point out some that I really like.
Then of course , the Iraq War , predicted to cost just 60 billion back in 2003.
How much of this diagram do you think might be taken up by the debt that Africa owes to the West ? 
What has that cost the world ?  Let ' s take a look at that.
So I want to show you another landscape now.
So , I ' ll label this for you in a second.
Bird flu.
And in summer , here , killer wasps.
Let me highlight it for you.
Why ? 
Well , in April 1999 was the Columbine shooting , and since then , that fear has been remembered by the media and echoes through the group mind gradually through the year.
Why is there a gap there ? 
It ' s not a particularly great metaphor in these times , especially if you live around the Gulf of Mexico , but I would , perhaps , adapt this metaphor slightly , and I would say that data is the new soil.
But it ' s a really fertile medium , and it feels like visualizations , infographics , data visualizations , they feel like flowers blooming from this medium.
Can you guess what this data set is ? 
You might want to get some chocolate in.
DM : Sick leave . Yeah , you ' ll definitely want to take some time off.
So there ' s a titanic amount of data out there now , unprecedented.
And here ' s my visual C.V.
I started as a programmer , and then I worked as a writer for many years , about 20 years , in print , online and then in advertising , and only recently have I started designing.
And when I started designing , I discovered an odd thing about myself.
I feel that everyday , all of us now are being blasted by information design.
And if you ' re navigating a dense information jungle , coming across a beautiful graphic or a lovely data visualization , it ' s a relief , it ' s like coming across a clearing in the jungle.
It has the same bandwidth as a computer network.
And that little square in the corner , a naught .7 percent , that ' s the amount we ' re actually aware of.
It loves them , and it calls them beautiful.
And that whole thing -- it ' s two languages both working at the same time.
Massive . 609 billion in 2008 -- 607 , rather.
So that might well chime with your view that America is a sort of warmongering military machine , out to overpower the world with its huge industrial-military complex.
So its military budget is bound to be enormous.
That changes the picture considerably.
Of course , 2.1 million.
China drops to 124th.
We need relative figures that are connected to other data so that we can see a fuller picture , and then that can lead to us changing our perspective.
I ' m a bit of a health nut.
This is a visualization of all the evidence for nutritional supplements.
So you can immediately apprehend the relationship between efficacy and popularity , but you can also , if you grade the evidence , do a  " worth it "  line.
And it was incredibly frustrating for me because I had a book of 250 visualizations to do for my book , and I spent a month doing this , and I only filled two pages.
So I converted this into an interactive app , so I can now generate this application online -- this is the visualization online -- and I can say ,  " Yeah , brilliant. " 
So heart is filtered out , so I can see if I ' m curious about that.
So the data is now alive ; this is a living image , and I can update it in a second.
It ' s kind of living.
What I love about this image is it ' s made up of concepts , it explores our worldviews and it helps us -- it helps me anyway -- to see what others think , to see where they ' re coming from.
But not too uncomfortable , because there ' s something unthreatening about seeing a political perspective , versus being told or forced to listen to one.
So , just to wrap up , I wanted to say that it feels to me that design is about solving problems and providing elegant solutions , and information design is about solving information problems.
So , visualizing information can give us a very quick solution to those kinds of problems.
Was it the planes or the volcano , the grounded planes or the volcano ? 
And that is beautiful . Thank you.

Except here it’s been split up in parts by Estée Lauder and by the perfumer who did it , Calice Becker , and I ' m most grateful to them for this.
I will show it to you.
Now what you are smelling is a combination of -- I asked how many molecules there were in there , and nobody would tell me.
You are all smelling pretty much the same thing , OK ? 
Now , while the smell wafts over you , let me tell you the history of an idea.
These are the five atoms from which just about everything that you’re going to smell in real life , from coffee to fragrance , are made of.
It has one double bond , it has an alcohol on the end , so it’s  " ol, "  and that’s why they call it cis-3-hexene-1-ol.
OK , now . Why does this thing smell of cut grass , OK ? 
Enzymes that chew things up , antibodies , it’s all , you know , the fit between a protein and whatever it is grabbing , in this case a smell.
And when I first came across it in the early  ' 90s , I thought my predecessor , Malcolm Dyson and Bob Wright , had really taken leave of their senses , and I’ll explain to you why this was the case.
And the attraction , the forces , between the molecule and the protein cause the motion . This is a shape-based idea.
Working for a fragrance company.
And he puts an exclamation mark , OK ?  This is an awful lot of work.
A theory is something that enables you to do less work.
Now , you will have noticed that vodka never smells of rotten eggs.
Conversely , there is no concentration at which the sulfur compound will smell like vodka.
In fact , molecules are able to vibrate at a set of frequencies which are very specific for each molecule and for the bonds connecting them.
Now , Fact B : nothing in the world has that frequency except S-H.
So I went searching when I started in this game to convince myself that there was any degree of plausibility to this whole crazy story.
Now the good news is , Boranes you can get hold of.
However , I managed to get a hold of a Borane eventually , and here is the beast.
So this fact that Boranes smell of sulfur had been known since 1910 , and utterly forgotten until 1997 , 1998.
And this is the main objection to the theory.
So it’s a joke against myself.
Electrons are fuzzy creatures , and they can jump across gaps , but only at equal energy . If the energy differs , they can’t jump.
This is the basis for the device that these two guys at Ford built.
Of course , it doesn’t matter , because it could also be that they’re not.
You need a computer , a Mac will do it , if you know how to program the thing right , OK ?  So you can try a thousand molecules , you can try ten thousand molecules in a weekend , and then you only tell the chemists to make the right one.
Now , coumarin is a very common thing , a material , in fragrance which is derived from a bean that comes from South America.
So nobody likes particularly to -- you know , aftershave with carcinogens.
And then you start cranking the computer to find other molecules , related or unrelated , that have the same vibrations.
Calculate the vibrations , the purple spectrum is that new fellow , the white one is the old one.
You see , when you’re a scientist , you’re always selling ideas.
And people often ask me , is your theory accepted ? 
OK ?  Now , we’re dealing with people who only want results , and this is the commercial world.
Thank you very much.

What are we going to do about it ?  I define simplicity as a means to achieving clarity , transparency and empathy , building humanity into communications.
So , very quickly , when President Obama said ,  " I don ' t see why we can ' t have a one-page , plain English consumer credit agreement. " 
Now , I went one step further and said ,  " Why do we have to stick with the stodgy lawyers and just have a paper document ?  Let ' s go online. " 
But it ' s going to work . It ' s more effective than just computational aids.
When you put it in plain English , you almost force the institution to give the people a way , a default out of that , and not put themselves at risk.
At such and such a date , IBM has responsibilities , you have responsibilities.
There are 200 million letters that go out.
They have been tested in the laboratory.
There is a lot of discussion now about a consumer financial protection agency , how to mandate simplicity.
There is no way we should do business with companies that have agreements with stealth provisions and that are unintelligible.

Lemn Sissay : A child of the state
Let ' s not talk about breastfeeding.
All of these great fictional characters , all of them who were hurt by their condition , all of them who spawned thousands of other books and other films , all of them were fostered , adopted or orphaned.
And why have we not made the connection , between — How has that happened ?  — between these incredible characters of popular culture and religions , and the fostered , adopted or orphaned child in our midst ?  It ' s not our pity that they need.
My own mother — and I should say this here — she same to this country in the late  ' 60s , and she was , you know , she found herself pregnant , as women did in the late  ' 60s . You know what I mean ? 
You were separated from your family by the state.
It was the primary purpose of the social worker , the aim , to get the woman at her most vulnerable time in her entire life , to sign the adoption papers.
A little break.
What happened then is a direct reflection of what is happening now . Everybody believed themselves to be doing the right thing by God and by the state for the big society , fast-tracking adoption.
If you were black , it was a summer of hate.
His name is Norman. " 
I was a sign from God , they said.
 " God , can I have a bike for Christmas ?  " 
Who knew ? 
Now , in their religiosity , in their naivete , my mom and dad , which I believed them to be forever , as they said they were , my mom and dad conceived that I had the Devil inside of me.
And I said ,  " Yeah , of course I do. "  Because you do.
The theology was perfect , the timing unquestionable , and the answer as honest as a sinner could get.
I didn ' t say goodbye to anybody , not my mother , my father , my sisters , my brothers , my aunts , my uncles , my cousins , my grandparents , nobody.
On the third children ' s home , at 15 , I started to rebel , and what I did was , I got three tins of paint , Airfix paint that you use for models , and I was -- it was a big children ' s home , big Victorian children ' s home -- and I was in a little turret at the top of it , and I poured them , red , yellow and green , the colors of Africa , down the tiles.
I wasn ' t charged for anything . I hadn ' t done anything wrong.
They -- I was put in a dormitory with a confirmed Nazi sympathizer.
That home was full of young boys who were on remand for things like murder.
I slowly became aware that I knew nobody that knew me for longer than a year.
I ' m just saying that you know when your birthday is by virtue of the fact that somebody tells you when your birthday is , a mother , a father , a sister , a brother , an aunt , an uncle , a cousin , a grandparent . It matters to someone , and therefore it matters to you . Understand , I was 14 years old , tucked away in myself , into myself , and I wasn ' t touched either , physically touched.
I ' ve just got to say it to you all : I found all of my family in my adult life . I spent all of my adult life finding them , and I ' ve now got a fully dysfunctional family just like everybody else.

I wrote this next poem for my mother.
She ' s 86 years old . She ' s frail.
Looks like a much prettier version of Margaret Thatcher , but without any of the soft bits in Margaret ' s character.
Never go back . Never go back.
Never succumb to the gorgon ' s stare.
Never retreat to the  ' glorious past. '  Keep to the track , to the beaten track ; Treat every day of your life as your last.
If every commercially minded cosmetic surgeon were tied end to end along a railroad track , that would be me , stoking the train without a qualm in the world.
Stop it.

Count thy sheep and not thy years.
Lady , this is all in vain.
What is foretold in the womb May not be foresworn with gold.
Think you I could cease to care ? 
America , ladies and gentlemen , has done more for me financially than Britain ever has , or ever could have done.
I hope you know that now.
Let me put this bluntly.
Hail to the gods of the dream.
The Brahmins of Capital Hill ? 
The worship of those we hate.
What of the temples of justice , Whose servants enslave us all ? 
Hail to the God of America , Whose power the masses extol -- Convenience rules America ; Convenience owns our soul.
Love came to visit me , shy as a fawn.
The flux of its lava cleared all in its path.
The fruits of my rivals , I shook from the tree.
From 40 to 50 , grown easy and sly , I wined them and dined them , like pigs in a sty.
Um , there are -- I ' ve got far too much money and I have far too much fun in my businesses.
Okay , I had a life-threatening illness , you know.
And from another nurse , I begged a pencil , pen.
But sometimes I try to put myself in an evil man ' s position.
But it ' s interesting to me . I love to write historical verse.
I don ' t know . You can do anything you want.
You think we didn ' t do that ? 
We hunted them down wherever they were.
And they never will.
And at seven o ' clock every night , I took me some more girls , already corrupted.
It was unbelievable.
Twenty-two godchildren I ' ve got.
The love of your son can utterly transform anything he does.
Shoulder to shoulder , Night after night , We hoarded and sold her -- Our Lady in White.
But always we scrabbled to lie with her first.
And there on the table we took her , in turns.
But only just.

Everyone was very excited about this archaeological find , because it meant that they might finally be able to assemble a single dodo skeleton.
If you go look at their website today , they ' ll actually list these specimens , saying , the rest was lost in a fire.
And I thought to myself , wouldn ' t it be great if I had my own dodo skeleton ? 
I had saved a few hundred photos of dodo skeletons into my  " Creative Projects "  folder -- it ' s a repository for my brain , everything that I could possibly be interested in.
Storm trooper costumes . Maps of Middle Earth -- that ' s one I hand-drew myself . There ' s the dodo skeleton folder.
And I looked down at this Sculpey , and I thought , maybe , yeah , maybe I could make my own dodo skull.
But you give me something like this -- my friend Mike Murnane sculpted this ; it ' s a maquette for  " Star Wars , Episode Two "  -- this is not my thing -- this is something other people do -- dragons , soft things.
This is someone selling this on eBay ; it was clearly a woman’s hand , hopefully a woman ' s hand.
I wasn ' t thinking about a dodo skeleton ; I just noticed that as I finished this skull , the armature wire that I had been used to holding it up was sticking out of the back just where a spine would be.
And actually , by the end of the day , I had a reasonable skull , a moderately good vertebrae and half of a pelvis.
And after about six weeks , I finished , painted , mounted my own dodo skeleton.
And this actually represented kind of a sea change to me.
And so I went back and looked through my  " Creative Projects "  folder , and I happened across the Maltese Falcon.
First of all , there ' s the object in the world.
Built out of words , it is the engine that drives the plot of his book and also the movie , in which another object is created : a prop that has to represent the thing that Hammett created out of words , inspired by the Kniphausen Hawk , and this represents the falcon in the movie.
I ' d bought a replica , a really crappy replica , of the Maltese Falcon on eBay , and had downloaded enough pictures to actually have some reasonable reference.
It was made out of resin , which wasn ' t a common material for movie props about the time the movie was made.
What do they do , how do you start something like that ?  I really don ' t know.
As I moved through , I achieved a very reasonable facsimile of the Maltese Falcon.
My preference is about 70 coats of this -- matte black auto primer.
So I was able to actually screen-shot and freeze-frame to make sure.
This is where it gets weird.
I ' ll go you one stranger than that : In 1974 , during the production of a weird comedy sequel to  " The Maltese Falcon, "  called  " The Black Bird, "  starring George Segal , the Los Angeles County Museum of Art had a plaster original of the Maltese Falcon -- one of the original six plasters , I think , made for the movie -- stolen out of the museum . A lot of people thought it was a publicity stunt for the movie.
So here I had this Falcon , and it was lovely . It looked really great , the light worked on it really well , it was better than anything that I could achieve or obtain out in the world.
It ' s a group of prop crazies just like me called the Replica Props Forum , and it ' s people who trade , make and travel in information about movie props.
And this thing , it ' s deeply , deeply satisfying to me.
Yeah , I know!
Now , here ' s the most recent progression of Falcons.
And when I held my bronze one up against my Sculpey one , it was shorter by three-quarters of an inch.
One , I can fire a freaking laser at it , which I have already done , to do a 3D scan -- there ' s a 3D scan of this Falcon.
But really , if we ' re all going to be honest with ourselves , I have to admit that achieving the end of the exercise was never the point of the exercise to begin with , was it.

And essentially we are just an upright-walking , big-brained , super-intelligent ape.
We are one species of about five and a half thousand mammalian species that exist on planet Earth today.
And it ' s important to remember that , because the bonobos are so human , and they share 99 percent of their genes with us.
We have a common past , and we have a common future.
A group of dedicated young men and women walk very slowly out across vast areas of Africa , looking for small fragments of bone , fossil bone , that may be on the surface.
We still really haven ' t got a very complete picture of it.
And we can bring all this information into big GIS packages , today.
And here ' s a very special moment , when my mother and myself were digging up some remains of human ancestors.
I ' d just like to point out , if you look at the map of Africa , it does actually look like a hominid skull in its shape.
It ' s a basin , and rivers flow down from the highlands into the basin , carrying sediment , preserving the bones of animals that lived there.
OK , so it is absolutely surprising that we know as much as we do know today about our ancestors , because it ' s incredibly difficult , A , for these things to become -- to be -- preserved , and secondly , for them to have been brought back up to the surface.
Fossil sites run up and down both lengths of that lake basin , which represents some 20,000 square miles.
And here is a skull of a Homo erectus , which I just pulled off the shelf there.
That ' s what we ' re still trying to find answers to , and it is important to realize that there is diversity in all different species , and our ancestors are no exception.
And we dug up giant tortoises , and elephants and things like that.
His brothers certainly were able to run long distances chasing prey , probably sweating heavily as they did so.
Unfortunately for him , he fell into a swamp and couldn ' t get out.
Well , an excavation was begun immediately , and more and more little bits of skull started to be extracted from the sediment.
He had a body very similar to our own , and he was on the threshold of becoming human.
But also , surprising finds recently announced from the Island of Flores in Indonesia , where a group of these human ancestors have been isolated , and have become dwarfed , and they ' re only about a meter in height.
Again , at about 200,000 years as a fully-fledged us.
We ' re certainly a polluting , wasteful , aggressive species , with a few nice things thrown in , perhaps.
And what is it that really makes us us ? 
And we ' ve also managed to communicate with people all over the world , from extraordinary places.
We ' ve only been around for the past 200,000 years as a species , yet we ' ve reached a population of more than six and a half billion people.
But what ' s happened is our technology has removed the checks and balances on our population growth.
Can we hold it together ? 
Evolutionarily speaking , we ' re just a blip.
Well , to end on a very positive note , I think evolutionarily speaking , this is probably a fairly good thing , in the end.
health,health care,storytelling
That ' s what defined me . That was my bliss.
We ' d been on our bikes for around five and half hours when we got to the part of the ride that I loved , and that was the hills , because I loved the hills.
My body was consumed by pain.
I ' d broken my neck and my back in six places.
My whole right side was ripped open , filled with gravel.
By the time the helicopter arrived at Prince Henry Hospital in Sydney , my blood pressure was 40 over nothing.
Why would I want to go back to a body that was so broken ? 
 " No . That body is broken . It can no longer serve me. " 
It was the fight of my life.
The vertebra at L1 was like you ' d dropped a peanut , stepped on it , smashed it into thousands of pieces.
They took out two of my broken ribs , and they rebuilt my back , L1 , they rebuilt it , they took out another broken rib , they fused T12 , L1 and L2 together.
But then the doctor came over to me , and she said ,  " Janine , the operation was a success , and we ' ve picked as much bone out of your spinal cord as we could , but the damage is permanent.
You ' ll have internal injuries for the rest of your life.
I tried to grasp what she was saying.
They moved me from intensive care to acute spinal.
I had a neck brace and sandbags on either side of my head and I saw my world through a mirror that was suspended above my head.
I remember one night , one of the nurses came in , Jonathan , with a whole lot of plastic straws.
And we did . And he said ,  " Right . Now we ' re all connected. " 
After six months , it was time to go home.
But before I left the hospital , the head nurse had said to me ,  " Janine , I want you to be ready , because when you get home , something ' s going to happen. " 
In the spinal ward , that ' s normal.
I realized Sister Sam was right.
And I wanted to give up.
And I thought ,  " How could it ?  Because I ' ve lost everything that I valued , everything that I ' d worked towards.
Maria was in a car accident , and she woke up on her 16th birthday to the news that she was a complete quadriplegic , had no movement from the neck down , had damage to her vocal chords , and she couldn ' t talk.
She was always happy , and even when she began to talk again , albeit difficult to understand , she never complained , not once.
It was everybody ' s pain . And then I knew , just like before , that I had a choice . I could keep fighting this or I could let go and accept not only my body but the circumstances of my life.
I had never before thought of myself as a creative person.
I was no longer tied to a set path.
If I can ' t walk , then I might as well fly. " 
She passed me the phone book , I rang up the flying school , I made a booking , said I ' d like to make a booking to come out for a flight.
I made a booking , and weeks later my friend Chris and my mom drove me out to the airport , all 80 pounds of me covered in a plaster body cast in a baggy pair of overalls.
And they took one look and ran out the back to draw short straws.
It was beautiful . They lifted me into the cockpit.
Andrew the instructor got in the front , started the airplane up.
He went ,  " Oh. " 
And Andrew said to me , as we got over the training area ,  " You see that mountain over there ?  " 
And I took the controls , and I was flying.
So I went home , I got a training diary out , and I had a plan.
So while the doctors continued to operate and put my body back together again , I went on with my theory study , and then eventually , and amazingly , I passed my pilot ' s medical , and that was my green light to fly.
And little goals kept me going along the way , and eventually I got my private pilot ' s license , and then I learned to navigate , and I flew my friends around Australia.
And then I got my instructor rating.
And I did , and I learned to fly upside down and became an aerobatics flying instructor.
I now know that it wasn ' t until I let go of who I thought I was that I was able to create a completely new life.
I know that I ' m not my body , and I also know that you ' re not yours.
So raise your straws if you ' ll join me.

And my little idea that will do that is sleep.
Two-and-a-half years ago , I fainted from exhaustion.
And we women are going to lead the way in this new revolution , this new feminist issue.
And I felt like saying to him -- but I didn ' t say it -- I felt like saying ,  " You know what ? 
they ' re likely to tell you ,  " Eight o ' clock is too late for me , but that ' s okay , I can get a game of tennis in and do a few conference calls and meet you at eight. " 
And we ' ve had far too many icebergs hitting our Titanics.
So I urge you to shut your eyes and discover the great ideas that lie inside us , to shut your engines and discover the power of sleep.

It was actually developed for use by the offshore oil industry for diving on oil rigs down to a depth of 2,000 feet.
I went down to a depth of 880 feet and turned out the lights.
It was breathtaking.
If I go out in the open ocean environment , virtually anywhere in the world , and I drag a net from 3,000 feet to the surface , most of the animals -- in fact , in many places , 80 to 90 percent of the animals that I bring up in that net -- make light.
So , mounted in front of the observation sphere , there ' s a a three-foot diameter hoop with a screen stretched across it.
You don ' t see luminescence until the submersible begins to move forward through the water , but as it does , animals bumping into the screen are stimulated to bioluminesce.
And so , here , in the Gulf of Maine at 740 feet , I can name pretty much everything you ' re seeing there to the species level.
And we can then do the kinds of things that ecologists do on land , and do nearest neighbor distances.
And this isn ' t someplace exotic like one of the bioluminescent bays in Puerto Rico , this was actually shot in San Diego Harbor.
Well , that was the question that 19th century French physiologist Raphael Dubois , asked about this bioluminescent clam.
In 2008 , the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded for work done on a molecule called green fluorescent protein that was isolated from the bioluminescent chemistry of a jellyfish , and it ' s been equated to the invention of the microscope , in terms of the impact that it has had on cell biology and genetic engineering.
So , for example , this fish has a built-in headlight behind its eye that it can use for finding food or attracting a mate.
Now , this one is blue , and that ' s the color of most bioluminescence in the ocean because evolution has selected for the color that travels farthest through seawater in order to optimize communication.
It ' s also got a little chin barbel here with a blue luminescent lure on it that it can use to attract prey from a long way off.
The teeth on this fish are so long that if they closed inside the mouth of the fish , it would actually impale its own brain.
It ' s got these jewel-like light organs on its belly that it uses for a type of camouflage that obliterates its shadow , so when it ' s swimming around and there ' s a predator looking up from below , it makes itself disappear.
These are the eyes of a living anglerfish.
So , now we believe that the different shape of the lure is how the male recognizes the female in the anglerfish world , because many of these males are what are known as dwarf males.
He ' s got to find himself a babe and then he ' s got to latch on for life.
Well , this is a deep-sea version of Women ' s Lib.
A lot of them can release their luciferin or luferase in the water just the way a squid or an octopus will release an ink cloud.
And I was luck enough to capture one of these when we were on a trawling expedition off the northwest coast of Africa for  " Blue Planet, "  for the deep portion of  " Blue Planet. " 
But to me , what ' s shocking is not just the amount of light , but the fact that it ' s not just luciferin and luciferase.
This jellyfish , for example , has a spectacular bioluminescent display.
And then to generate the display you ' re about to see , all I did was touch it once per second on its nerve ring with a sharp pick that ' s sort of like the sharp tooth of a fish.
And I thought ,  " You know , that might actually make a pretty good lure. " 
The other primary way is we go down with submersibles and remote-operated vehicles.
And so , sometime ago , I got this idea for a camera system.
We use far-red light , but even that ' s a problem because it gets absorbed so quickly.
So I kluged this together , I got the Harvey Mudd Engineering Clinic to actually do it as an undergraduate student project initially , and then I kluged funding from a whole bunch of different sources.
But there came a moment when it all came together , and everything worked.
And we were very , very happy.
And I know this footage isn ' t going to look like anything to you -- we had a crummy camera at the time -- but I was ecstatic.
I , for the first time , could see what animals were doing down there when we weren ' t down there disturbing them in some way.
And based on this , I went back to the National Science Foundation and said ,  " This is what we will discover. " 
So if you ever , ever get an opportunity to take a dive in a submersible , say yes -- a thousand times , yes -- and please turn out the lights.
DNA,arts,biology,creativity,design,industrial design,invention,nature,product design,transportation
They are first cousins , and you know what happens when , you know -- so there ' s a terribly weird freaky side to me , which I ' m fighting with all the time . So to try and get through today , I ' ve kind of disciplined myself with an 18-minute talk.
But today what I ' d like to talk to you about is that love of form and how form can touch people ' s soul and emotion.
These -- this artificially induced consumerism -- I think it ' s atrocious.
So I am a 21st-century translator of technology into products that we use everyday and relate beautifully and naturally with.
DNA : Design , Nature , Art . These are the three things that condition my world.
People like Leonardo -- there have not been many -- had this amazingly instinctive curiosity.
Impressionism being the most valuable art form on the planet as we know it : 100 million dollars , easily , for a Monet.
Here you see the machining , the milling of a block of acrylic.
So we go . We look at the tooling . We look at how that is produced.
It is more valuable than the product in my eyes . I don ' t have one.
It was when I put the water in that I realized that I ' d put a skin on water itself.
It fits arthritic hands . It fits children ' s hands.
Biopolymers , these new ideas for materials , will come into play in probably a decade.
I took this video in Cape Town last year.
When I look at these things , they look pretty normal to me.
It comes back to instinct.
This is a scan through the human forearm . It ' s then blown up through rapid prototyping to reveal the cellular structure . I have these in my office.
This is made -- bone is made from a mixture of inorganic minerals and polymers.
A meringue is made exactly the same way , in my estimation , as a bone.
Not a bad idea . I don ' t know . I need to talk to Janine and a few other people about that , but I believe instinctively that that meringue can become something , a car -- I don ' t know.
It shows this interlocution of elements and the beauty of kind of engineering and biological thinking , shown pretty much as a bone structure.
It went into Time magazine in 2001 as the new language of the 21st century.
It ' s a godly way of working.
This is an idea for a gas-injected , one-piece polymer chair.
I don ' t -- and they look funky too -- but I don ' t set out to make funky things because I think that ' s an absolute disgrace.
This is what exists in nature . Observation now allows us to bring that natural process into the design process every day . That ' s what I do.
If he was a car designer , phew , we ' d all be driving one.
This is my artwork . This is all my process.
I ' ll tell you about that later.
Coral , all these natural forces , take away what they don ' t need and they deliver maximum beauty.
It ' s a gas-injected polymer chair.
If you see the shadows that come through that , they ' re actually probably more important than the product , but it ' s the minimum it takes.
I ' m looking at single-surface structures and how they flow -- how they stretch and flow . It ' s based on furniture typologies , but that ' s not the end motivation . It ' s made from aluminum , as opposed to aluminium , and it ' s grown.
I have a big show with Phillips Auctioneers.
So I try to create this energy of invention every day in my studio.
I would love to build this one day , and perhaps I ' d like to build it also out of flour , sugar , polymer , wood chips -- I don ' t know , human hair . I don ' t know . I ' d love a go at that.
What is our dream ?  How do we beat Apple ?  " 
No , it ' s true . Fuck  ' em . Fuck  ' em . You know , I mean.
That ' s the car of the future . It ' s a water droplet.
They laughed everywhere over the world I showed this.
It ' s got a vacuum-formed , carbon-nylon pan . Everything ' s holistically integrated.
You plug them in . Off you jolly well go.
There ' s a hole at the front , and there ' s a reason for that.
That ' s what happens if you get inspired by the street lamp first , and then do the car second . These bubbles -- I can see these bubbles with these hydrogen packages , floating around on the ground driven by AI.
And that ' s what I do with my furniture.
I ' m trying to build transportation systems.
I built this thing for my studio.
Took about two years , because I ' m looking for fat-free design.
This is a shot in the studio.
Who cares ? 
It ' s next to David Hockney ' s original studio.
I bought that last year . They ' re very difficult to find.
You never see architects or designers showing you their real world.
We should all be riding one of these.
I ' m a contaminator for all those children of investment bankers -- wankers.
Lots of stuff . There ' s a little leaf chair -- that golden looking thing is called  " Leaf. " 
[Unclear] , working at three o ' clock in the morning -- and I don ' t pay overtime.
And when I see Ed ' s photographs I think , why the hell am I going to China ?  It ' s true.
If all the people who were talking over this period worked on a car together , it would be a joy , absolute joy.
A copper jelly mold.
Thank you very much.

Back in 1995 , we got a new wing next to the museum.
The only thing I had to do was go out , pick them up , and have them stuffed for the collection.
This is the dead duck . It flew against the window.
And then this happened.
One is dead , one is alive . That must be necrophilia.
After 75 minutes — — I had seen enough , and I got hungry , and I wanted to go home.
[The first case of homosexual necrophilia in the mallard Anas platyrhynchos ] I knew I ' d seen something special , but it took me six years to decide to publish it.
And here ' s the situation again.
But then something good happened.
I went -- let me remind you that Marc Abrahams didn ' t call me from Stockholm.
That ' s the first thing.
Dan , where are you ?  Dan Ariely ? 
This is its first time on the U.S . West Coast.
Please note it ' s a museum specimen , but there ' s no chance you ' ll get the avian flu.
This is a moose.
This is the Netherlands , 2011.
It ' s remarkable : the position.
This is a turkey in Wisconsin on the premises of the Ethan Allen juvenile correctional institution.
Well , what I concluded from reviewing all these cases is that it is important that this happens only when death is instant and in a dramatic way and in the right position for copulation.
So there goes my theory of necrophilia.
Here he goes , and here ' s a short video.
It ' s not . I show you here some slides , some frames from the video , and at the last moment before he hits the glass , he puts his feet in front , and then he bangs against the glass.
And as you know , or as you may not know , this is one of the major causes of death for birds in the world.
Oh , sorry.
Artist Neil Harbisson was born completely color blind , but these days a device attached to his head turns color into audible frequencies . Instead of seeing a world in grayscale , Harbisson can <em>hear</em> a symphony of color -- and yes , even listen to faces and paintings.
Well , I was born with a rare visual condition called achromatopsia , which is total color blindness , so I ' ve never seen color , and I don ' t know what color looks like , because I come from a grayscale world.
It ' s a color sensor that detects the color frequency in front of me — — and sends this frequency to a chip installed at the back of my head , and I hear the color in front of me through the bone , through bone conduction.
This is the sound of a dirty sock.
I didn ' t have to think about the notes.
It ' s when I started to feel that the cybernetic device was no longer a device.
So , life has changed dramatically since I hear color , because color is almost everywhere , so the biggest change for example is going to an art gallery , I can listen to a Picasso , for example . So it ' s like I ' m going to a concert hall , because I can listen to the paintings.
Especially the aisle with cleaning products.
Now I dress in a way that it sounds good.
So depending on how I display it , I can hear and I can compose music with food.
And it might happen the opposite , the other way around . So I really enjoy creating , like , sound portraits of people.
Some people , I would never relate , but they sound similar.
So I connect the eye , and then I play the audience ' s faces.
The BBC beeps , they sound turquoise , and listening to Mozart became a yellow experience , so I started to paint music and paint people ' s voices , because people ' s voices have frequencies that I relate to color.
And this is a completely different song.
One of them is Martin Luther King ' s  " I Have A Dream, "  and the other one is Hitler.
I was able to differentiate all the degrees of the color wheel.
For example , perceiving infrared is good because you can actually detect if there ' s movement detectors in a room.
We should all think that knowledge comes from our senses , so if we extend our senses , we will consequently extend our knowledge.
I would encourage you to become a cyborg.

If you build a wide road out to the outskirts of town , people will move there.
If you run a business , it ' s hard to do much of anything without calling your general counsel.
But it ' s not just business that ' s affected by this , it ' s actually pressed down into the daily activities of ordinary people.
She was wholly unconcerned about the bears , but she was terrified of lawyers.
So , she had to go to meeting after meeting , same arguments made over and over again.
You have to go in a school bus. " 
At the end of this day I could have filled a book just with stories about law from this one teacher.
It ' s changed the way we talk . I was talking to a pediatrician friend in North Carolina . He said ,  " Well you know , I don ' t deal with patients the same way anymore.
Now for 20 years , tort reformers have been sounding the alarm that lawsuits are out of control.
And the total of direct tort cost in this country is about two percent , which is twice as much as in other countries but , as taxes go , hardly crippling.
So , what do we do about it ? 
We ' ve been trained to think that the way to look at every dispute , every issue , is a matter of kind of individual rights.
And of course the hindsight bias is perfect.
It ' s not the basis of the rule of law , it ' s not the basis of a free society.
Is it working ? 
Doctors can make more on ordering tests sometimes , and also they no longer even know what ' s right or wrong.
Well that ' s been studied too , by the Institute of Medicine and others . Turns out that ' s not the case.
As we saw with the teacher in Cody , Wyoming , she seems to be affected by the law.
Tens of thousands of discreet rules , 60 steps to suspend a student from school : It ' s a formula for paralysis.
That means those students are getting half the learning they ' re supposed to , because if one child is disrupting the class no one can learn.
It ' s not that they usually sue , it ' s not that they would win , but it ' s an indication of the corrosion of authority.
The other day at the State of the Union speech , President Obama said , and I think we could all agree with this goal ,  " From the first railroads to the interstate highway system , our nation has always been the first to compete.
Idiots . A couple of years ago , Broward County , Florida , banned running at recess.
 " Caution : Contents are hot, "  on billions of coffee cups.
My favorite warning was one on a five-inch fishing lure.
And why not ?  They don ' t trust the law . Why don ' t they trust the law ? 
But the challenge here is not one of just amending the law , because the hurdle for success is trust.
But law is different than other kinds of uncertainties , because it carries with it the power of state.
It drives people from the smart part of the brain -- that dark , deep well of the subconscious , where instincts and experience , and all the other factors of creativity and good judgment are -- it drives us to the thin veneer of conscious logic.
If you tell the pianist to think about how she ' s hitting the notes when she ' s playing the piece , she can ' t play the piece.
Tweaking the law ' s clearly not good enough , and tort reform , which is a great idea , lowers your cost if you ' re a businessperson , but it ' s like a Band-Aid on this gaping wound of distrust.
And it is this : Law sets boundaries , and on one side of those boundaries are all the things you can ' t do or must do -- you can ' t steal , you ' ve got to pay your taxes -- but those same boundaries are supposed to define and protect a dry ground of freedom.
So , what ' s needed now is to rebuild these boundaries.
Because no one will want to take the risk of a lawsuit.
Life is too complex for a software program.
And there are two essential elements of it : We have to simplify the law.
Law has to be simple enough so that people can internalize it in their daily choices.
We have to rehumanize the law.
This is the hardest hurdle.
Takes five minutes . That ' s it , it ' s not that hard.
They ' re still bounded by legal goals and principles : The teacher is accountable to the principal , the judge is accountable to an appellate court , the president is accountable to voters.
We can pull the plug on a lot of this stuff if we shift our philosophy.
If teachers don ' t have authority to run the classroom , to maintain order , everybody ' s learning suffers.
That ' s what ' s happened to America . Look around.
In an intimate talk , Barry Schwartz dives into the question  " How do we do the right thing ?  "  With help from collaborator Kenneth Sharpe , he shares stories that illustrate the difference between following the rules and truly choosing wisely.
The first thing I want to do is say thank you to all of you.
So there is among many people -- certainly me and most of the people I talk to -- a kind of collective dissatisfaction with the way things are working , with the way our institutions run.
They almost brought the entire financial system down.
They don ' t understand us.
Give teachers scripts to follow in the classroom , so even if they don ' t know what they ' re doing and don ' t care about the welfare of our kids , as long as they follow the scripts , our kids will get educated.
More and more rules to protect us against an indifferent , uncaring set of institutions we have to deal with.
We passed a bunch of rules to regulate the financial industry in response to the recent collapse.
In addition , we are struggling to find some way to create incentives for people in the financial services industry that will have them more interested in serving the long-term interests even of their own companies , rather than securing short-term profits.
But what we believe , and what we argue in the book , is that there is no set of rules , no matter how detailed , no matter how specific , no matter how carefully monitored and enforced , there is no set of rules that will get us what we need.
It is naive beyond description to think that having blocked this source of financial collapse , you have blocked all possible sources of financial collapse.
We need people who want to do the right thing.
And he was impressed at how they would improvise novel solutions to novel problems -- problems that they hadn ' t anticipated.
They fashion a novel solution to the problem.
Dealing with other people demands a kind of flexibility that no set of rules can encompass.
The rules are like the notes on the page , and that gets you started , but then you dance around the notes on the page , coming up with just the right combination for this particular moment with this particular set of fellow players.
A wise person knows when to improvise.
And so the will to do the right thing is just as important as the moral skill of improvisation and exception-finding.
Michael ' s a young guy.
He panicked about being able to support his family.
He got caught . He got tried.
He had never committed a crime before.
And so she improvised a sentence -- 11 months , and not only that , but release every day to go to work.
And the family was united.
He did after all have a toy gun.
Judge Forer had to follow the law.
So that is an example , both of wisdom in practice and the subversion of wisdom by rules that are meant , of course , to make things better.
All these schools in Texas compete with one another to achieve these milestones , and there are bonuses and various other treats that come if you beat the other schools.
Focus all of your time and attention on the kids who are on the bubble , the so-called  " bubble kids "  -- kids where your intervention can get them just maybe over the line from failing to passing.
Now Ken and I are not naive , and we understand that you need to have rules.
First , they demoralize the people who are engaged in the activity.
It creates people -- when you manipulate incentives to get people to do the right thing -- it creates people who are addicted to incentives.
We know that if you reward kids for drawing pictures , they stop caring about the drawing and care only about the reward.
If instead you reward doctors for doing fewer procedures , they will do fewer.
We think , Ken and I , that there are real sources of hope.
And so what they do is they follow the scripts , but they follow the scripts at double-time and squirrel away little bits of extra time during which they teach in the way that they actually know is effective.
These are people who are looking not to dodge the system ' s rules and regulations , but to transform the system , and we talk about several.
He was married , he had a third kid on the way , he suffered from PTSD , in addition to the bad back , and recurrent nightmares , and he had started using marijuana to ease some of the symptoms.
His family was kicked out of their apartment , and the welfare system was threatening to take away his kids.
He was in a court called the Veterans '  Court.
And he had created it exactly because mandatory sentencing laws were taking the judgment out of judging.
Stayed with them , followed up on them , made sure that they were sticking to whatever plan had been jointly developed to get them over the hump.
None . None.
The bank helped finance the rebuilding of what was otherwise a dying community.
They didn ' t make loans and then sell the loans.
Even Goldman Sachs once used to serve clients , before it turned into an institution that serves only itself.
So the patients are not organ systems , and they ' re not diseases ; they ' re people , people with lives.
So there are lots of examples like this that we talk about.
They want to have permission to do the right thing.
Love : managing successfully relations with the people who are close to you and with the communities of which you are a part.
Rules and incentives don ' t tell you how to be a good friend , how to be a good parent , how to be a good spouse , or how to be a good doctor or a good lawyer or a good teacher.
In giving us the will and the skill to do the right thing -- to do right by others -- practical wisdom also gives us the will and the skill to do right by ourselves.
global issues,history,medicine,technology,war
Now , there ' s a bigger question that ' s probably actually more important than that , is the notion of permanently eliminating the possibility of a nuclear attack , eliminating the threat altogether.
And in 1945 , we were the only nuclear power.
And from 1949 to 1985 was an extraordinary time of a buildup of a nuclear arsenal that no one could possibly have imagined back in the 1940s.
After 1985 , and before the break up of the Soviet Union , we began to disarm from a nuclear point of view.
But we also , in that period of time , added two more members to the nuclear club : Pakistan and North Korea.
It was characterized by a nation-versus-nation , very fragile standoff.
It stands for mutually assured destruction.
During this chapter one , there was a high level of public awareness about the potential of nuclear catastrophe , and an indelible image was implanted in our collective minds that , in fact , a nuclear holocaust would be absolutely globally destructive and could , in some ways , mean the end of civilization as we know it.
So premise one is we ' d be destroying the world , and then premise two is , why don ' t we get prepared for it ? 
This was basically an attempt to teach our schoolchildren that if we did get engaged in a nuclear confrontation and atomic war , then we wanted our school children to kind of basically duck and cover.
Maybe it would be a study when we weren ' t having an atomic war , or you could use it as a TV room , or , as many teenagers found out , a very , very safe place for a little privacy with your girlfriend.
Yet , what percentage of Americans do you think ever had a bomb shelter in their house ? 
And one of the greatest governmental delusions of all time was something that happened in the early days of the Federal Emergency Management Agency , FEMA , as we now know , and are well aware of their behaviors from Katrina.
We would move people out of the target cities into the countryside.
The idea was that we would force the Soviets to re-target their nuclear weapons -- very expensive -- and potentially double their arsenal , to not only take out the original site , but take out sites where people were going.
The civil defense programs were disconnected from the reality of what we ' d see in all-out nuclear war.
So no possibility of medical response to , or meaningful preparedness for all-out nuclear war.
Chapter two starts in 1991.
Although the scenario has changed very considerably , the fact is that we haven ' t changed our mental image of what a nuclear war means.
First thing is that the global nuclear weapons , in the stockpiles that I showed you in those original maps , happen to be not uniformly secure.
They ' re acquirable , let me put it that way.
How much of that do you think it would take to actually build a 10-kiloton bomb ? 
This is what you would need to steal or buy out of that 100-metric-ton stockpile that ' s relatively insecure to create the type of bomb that was used in Hiroshima.
Now this situation , already I -- you know , I don ' t really like thinking about this , although somehow I got myself a job where I have to think about it . So the point is that we ' re very , very insecure in terms of developing this material.
There ' s an unbelievable amount of know-how out there.
All of this information is relatively available.
They are very dedicated and committed.
Since there is no real retribution possible that would make any difference , since there are people willing to actually give up their lives in order to do a lot of damage to us , it becomes apparent that the whole notion of this mutually assured destruction would not work.
McVeigh and Nichols , and the Oklahoma City attack in the 1990s was a good example of homegrown terrorists.
What you saw after Katrina is a very good indicator of how little prepared the United States is for any kind of major attack.
And Lebed came to the United States and told us that many , many -- more than 80 of the suitcase bombs were actually not accountable.
The suitcase can be conveniently dropped in your trunk of your car.
It was 9.8 feet long , weighed 8,800 pounds . You go down to your local rent-a-truck and for 50 bucks or so , you rent a truck that ' s got the right capacity , and you take your bomb , you put it in the truck and you ' re ready to go.
I think there ' s a lot of people in the intelligence community -- a lot of people who deal with this work in general think it ' s almost inevitable , unless we do certain things to really try to defuse the risk , like better interdiction , better prevention , better fixing , you know , better screening of cargo containers that are coming into the country and so forth.
There ' s still enough nuclear weapons in the arsenals of the superpowers to destroy the Earth many , many times over.
I ' m back in my truck , and we drove over the Brooklyn Bridge.
This is the ultimate.
Two-mile radius , you have a 50 percent chance of being killed , and up to about eight miles away -- now I ' m talking about killed instantly -- somewhere between a 10 and 20 percent chance of getting killed.
Well , if we ' re talking about the old days of an all-out nuclear attack , you , up here , are as dead as the people here . So it was a moot point.
So if there ' s any way that you can avoid , like , avert your eyes , that would be a good thing.
And if you ' re in this vicinity , you ' ve got to get away.
If you can ' t get out of there , we want you to go into a shelter and stay there.
Over the next few days to a week , there will be a radiation cloud , again , going with the wind , and settling down for another 15 or 20 miles out -- in this case , over Long Island.
But in 2008 , there isn ' t one single American city that has done effective plans to deal with a nuclear detonation disaster.
And we ' re trying to tell them ,  " It ' s not futile.
The key to surviving a nuclear blast is getting out , and not going into harm ' s way.
So here ' s what you do . First of all , as I said , don ' t stare at the light flash , if you can . I don ' t know you could possibly resist doing that.
And you want to get under something so that you ' re not injured or killed by objects , if that ' s at all possible.
Once you ' re out and evacuating , you want to keep as much of your skin , your mouth and nose covered , as long as that covering doesn ' t impede you moving and getting out of there.
In conclusion , nuclear war is less likely than before , but by no means out of the question , and it ' s not survivable.
And you want something to work on once you ' ve fixed global warming , I urge you to think about the fact that we have to do something about this unacceptable , inhumane reality of nuclear weapons in our world.
http://www.ted.com/talks/christophe_adami_finding_life_we_can_t_imagine.html
Christoph Adami : Finding life we can ' t imagine
And I was thinking about quarks and gluons and heavy ion collisions , and I was only 14 years old.
But I ' m going to tell you about something else today.
But it was an exciting experience.
I said ,  " I have no idea. " 
And I said ,  " Really ? 
And then I thought about it a little bit , and I said ,  " Well , is it really that easy ? 
Except , if you think life is also defined by things that die , you ' re not in luck with this thing , because that ' s actually a very strange organism.
And he was like ,  " My God , what kind of a life form is that ?  " 
Except , if you look a little bit closer , you see , in fact , that this thing is way too small to be anything like that.
If you take the lesson of all these pictures , then you realize , well actually maybe it ' s not that easy.
Well of course , you ' d go to Encyclopedia Britannica and open at L.
And then you might come up with something like this.
So I ' m highlighting just a few words and saying definitions like that rely on things that are not based on amino acids or leaves or anything that we are used to , but in fact on processes only.
And so if you go and ask yourself ,  " What on Earth is artificial life ?  "  , let me give you a whirlwind tour of how all this stuff came about.
And it is in fact due to this arms race between hackers and operating system designers that things go back and forth.
In fact , they have hackers writing them.
But there was another scientist who had been watching this , an ecologist.
And I decided to create a system that has all the properties that are necessary to see the evolution of complexity , more and more complex problems constantly evolving.
They are now actually respectable professors at Michigan State University , but I can assure you , back in the day , we were not a respectable team.
But what I wanted to focus on is this type of population structure.
Any time there is a program that ' s better at surviving in this world , due to whatever mutation it has acquired , it is going to spread over the others and drive the others to extinction.
And we put them in , and what you see immediately is that there are waves and waves of innovation.
So you see waves of new types taking over the other types.
So what we see here is a system that lives in very much the way we ' re used to life [going.] But what the NASA people had asked me really was ,  " Do these guys have a biosignature ? 
In fact , it should perhaps make use of the concepts that I developed just in order to sort of capture what a simple living system might be. " 
As long as I know that there ' s some sort of alphabet.
And I ' m telling you , this is very robust across English texts.
It doesn ' t matter whether it ' s a poem or whether it ' s a mathematical text.
But first I have to ask : what are these building blocks , like the alphabet , elements that I showed you ? 
So that we actually , to test this idea , first took a look at amino acids and some other carboxylic acids.
That is also very robust -- what you find in systems like Earth where there are amino acids , but there is no life.
So this also turns out to be extremely robust.
Now you could ask : well , what about these Avidians ? 
And if you have a system where they ' re being replaced one by the other , it ' s like the monkeys writing on a typewriter.
And there ' s actually some instructions that you only use once , if ever.
I can tell you indeed it is , because this type of spectrum , just like what you ' ve seen in books , and just like what you ' ve seen in amino acids , it doesn ' t really matter how you change the environment , it ' s very robust ; it ' s going to reflect the environment.
And below there , I show , in fact , the mutation rate in the environment.
And indeed , we ' re going to be dropping these guys into that soup all the time.
Now the viability threshold is reached , and the frequency distribution has dramatically changed and , in fact , stabilizes.
You hit the viability threshold.
What do we learn from that ? 
And if you can do that , then you have life.
Granted , it ' s limited , but we have learned what it takes in order to actually construct it.
And so that ' s really the only take-home message that I have for you.
And thank you very much.
723
And on the other side there was a rising sun.
We learn , maybe not the famous TED audience , but so many other people learn , that the unknown , the doubts , the question marks are dangerous.
And in that sense , ballooning is a beautiful metaphor.
How do we steer a balloon ? 
But how do we do that ? 
And when we drop the ballast overboard we climb.
It ' s not true.
Habits , certainties , convictions , exclamation marks , paradigms , dogmas.
And pioneering spirit will be each time we allow ourselves to explore this vertical axis.
This can be in politics.
Because we will throw away these political dogmas.
Well , these basically are things I believed in such a long time.
But sometimes it ' s very paradoxical.
And I was so proud to have found that jetstream that I called the weather man , and I told him ,  " Hey , guy , don ' t you think we ' re good pilots up there ? 
We don ' t have enough gas to fly so slow. " 
And this is why you need weathermen.
So , we went down actually.
When we were flying over the Sahara and India it was nice holidays.
That ' s the moment when you have to wake up from the automatic way of thinking.
We changed completely our strategy.
We took off with 3.7 tons of liquid propane.
I had no idea how it was possible.
It allowed to do all those things there.
So how can we perpetuate this pioneering spirit with something that will be independent from fossil energy ? 
Not to conquer the planet or space , not anymore , it has been done , but rather to improve the quality of life.
So , the idea is that if we fly around the world in a solar powered airplane , using absolutely no fuel , nobody ever could say in the future that it ' s impossible to do it for cars , for heating systems , for computers , and so on and so on.
If we want to show the potential , we have to fly day and night.
I think you need a pilot in the plane that can talk to the universities , that can talk to students , talk to politicians during the flight , and really make it a human adventure.
Why that ?  Because fuel is not easy to replace.
So the question is , how can you carry a pilot around the world with an airplane that uses the same amount of energy as a big Christmas tree ? 
We have gone through the stages of simulation , design , computing , preparing the construction of the first prototype.
It ' s not designed by an artist , but it could be.
And one month ago we have unveiled it.
The goal is to take off , end of this year for the first test , but mainly next year , spring or summer , take off , on our own power , without additional help , without being towed , climb to 9,000 meters altitude.
If our airplane is too heavy , if the pilot wastes energy , we ' ll never make it through the night.
But when Lindbergh crossed the Atlantic , the payload was also just sufficient for one person and some fuel.
This is a painting from Magritte , in the museum in Holland that I love so much.
What pleases me very much is that in the beginning I thought that we would have to fly around the world with no fuel in order to have our message been understood.
No , the success will come if enough people are motivated to do exactly the same in their daily life , save energy , go to renewables.
This is why all the people who believe in this type of spirit are welcome to be on that team.
So , you see , this is what we ' re doing on our side.
Because the most renewable energy we have is our own potential , and our own passion.
art,book,language,music,poetry,writing
We utter about six metaphors a minute.
I am , of course , referring to none other than Elvis Presley.
Lips are not lips , but volcanoes.
This is the mathematics of metaphor.
Elvis uses it , but so does Shakespeare in this famous line from  " Romeo and Juliet: "  Juliet is the sun.
And metaphor gives us a much more vivid understanding of Juliet than if Shakespeare had literally described what she looks like.
Look at this image . What do you see ? 
Second step , conceptual synesthesia.
This is the Bouba/Kiki test.
Does that correspond ? 
And many of the metaphors we use everyday are synesthetic.
Sexually unattractive people leave us cold.
What you need to do here is identify as quickly as possible the color of the ink in which these words are printed.
Stroop tests have been done with metaphor as well.
One of the sentences was ,  " Some jobs are jails. " 
Metaphor matters because it ' s around us every day , all the time.
Object metaphors describe price movements as non-living things , as in ,  " The Dow fell like a brick. " 
If , for example , house prices are routinely described as climbing and climbing , higher and higher , people might naturally assume that that rise is unstoppable.
Metaphor also matters because it influences decisions by activating analogies.
Intervene , appeal to the U.N. , or do nothing ? 
Just as we cannot ignore the literal meaning of words , we cannot ignore the analogies that are triggered by metaphor.
Einstein described his scientific method as combinatory play.
But you just have to look at the words around you and you ' ll find it.
Take the three most famous words in all of Western philosophy :  " Cogito ergo sum. " 
So , the original meaning of  " cogito "  is to shake together.
And metaphor keeps the mind shaking , rattling and rolling , long after Elvis has left the building.

I just really want to thank you very much.
My lower half is appearing at a different conference in a different country.
And though I ' m a rock star , I just want to assure you that none of my wishes will include a hot tub.
What turns me on about the digital age , what excites me personally , is that you have closed the gap between dreaming and doing.
Now , you need a camera that fits in your palm , and a couple of bucks for a blank DVD.
What I would like to see is idealism decoupled from all constraints.
And that ' s actually what I ' d like to talk about today.
Band Aid , Live Aid.
We went on the quiet to see for ourselves what was going on.
Don ' t ask.
Anybody who ever gave anything to Africa got a lot more back.
It was the middle of that awful famine.
And in that moment , I started this journey.
That ' s not a cause . That ' s an emergency.
The right to live like a human.
Because this is not all about charity.
And that ' s too bad , because we ' re very good at charity.
Look at the response to the tsunami -- it ' s inspiring.
It mocks our pieties . It doubts our concern.
Not here , not in America , not in Europe.
And deep down , if we really accepted that Africans were equal to us , we would all do more to put the fire out.
Does stuff have to look like an action movie these days to exist in the front of our brain ? 
Anyway , I believe that that kind of thinking offends the intellectual rigor in this room.
They ' re attempting to bring order to chaos.
In turbulent times , isn ' t it cheaper , and smarter , to make friends out of potential enemies than to defend yourself against them later ? 
There ' s an opportunity here , and it ' s real.
And that might be smart in these nervous , dangerous times.
In certain quarters of the world , brand EU , brand USA , is not at its shiniest.
Never before have we in the west been so scrutinized.
Brand USA could use some polishing.
More anti-retrovirals make sense.
What on earth can we all do about this ? 
This is the straight truth , the righteous truth.
And let me say this without a trace of irony -- before I back it up to a bunch of ex-hippies.
Look at the Gates Foundation.
I ' m sorry to laugh here , but you do look so different than you did in Haight-Ashbury in the  ' 60s.
This is what excites me.
Well , now , actually because of you , it is possible to change the physical world.
Probably because when we admit we can do something about it , we ' ve got to do something about it.
Do we have the will ? 
Actually , I come from punk rock.
You see , idealism detached from action is just a dream.
We ' re calling it the ONE Campaign.
We believe this is one.
Lurching a little , but it ' s building.
They made some really great promises , and actually have fulfilled a lot of them.
I understand that.
Not only in lives saved , but in goodwill , stability and security that we ' ll gain.
That ' s really what I would like you to do.
Together you have changed the zeitgeist from analog to digital , and pushed the boundaries.
There ' s the continent Africa.
Artists , politicians , pop stars , priests , CEOs , NGOs , mothers '  unions , student unions.
When the history books get written , I think our age will be remembered for three things.
And what we did or did not do to put out the fires in Africa.
The ones that TED has offered to grant.
This business , it gets to be addictive , you know what I mean , when somebody else is picking up the tab.
I believe it ' s possible.
We know there ' s more than enough energy to power this movement.
I do believe if we build a movement that ' s one million Americans strong , we ' re not going to be denied.
Anyway , so I ' d like your help in getting that signed up.
That ' s one billion media hits.
Actually we ' re talking to ABC today about the Oscars.
I really believe that old Truman line , that if you give the American people the facts , they ' ll do the right thing.
The problem is enormous.
We can beat extreme poverty , starvation , AIDS.
Americans have an unprecedented opportunity.
Please visit ONE at this address.
I believe we can connect every school in Ethiopia , every health clinic , every hospital -- we can connect to the Internet.
And that would be a mind-blowing wish to come true.
But it didn ' t start out that way.
The average waiting time to get a landline in Ethiopia is actually about seven or eight years.
Nurses getting better training , pharmacists being able to order supplies , doctors sharing their expertise in all aspects of medicine.

Nadia Al-Sakkaf : See Yemen through my eyes
And I would like to share with you all some of the pictures that are happening today in Yemen.
The intensity of the upspring.
I just wanted to show that over 60 percent of the Yemeni population are 15 years and below.
Yemenis are using cartoons and art , paintings , comics , to tell the world and each other about what ' s going on.
And finally , lots of people are saying that Yemen ' s revolution is going to break the country.
PM : Thank you for those images , Nadia.
Your father is murdered.
I ' ve guessed you ' ve already noticed this by now.
I wish you could see Yemen through my eyes.
And he was such an extraordinary man.
And I went back home and I said ,  " Daddy , I don ' t know who I am.
So since then I ' ve been the bridge , and a lot of people have walked over me.
 " What ' s this young girl coming in and showing off because it ' s her family business, "  or something.
It was very hard , you know , to impose my authority.
Brought in younger men.
And I don ' t know if I ' m going to be boasting now , but in 2006 alone , we won three international awards.
If you could please stand up , [unclear].
And so along with changing who worked there , you must have come up against another positioning that we always run into , in particular with women , and it has to do with outside image , dress , the veiled woman.
And a lot of it is because women are not able , are not free , to show their face to their self.
So the other face of Yemen is actually one that lies behind the veil , and it ' s economic empowerment mostly that allows the woman to just uncover it.
And then after that , you can take it off on assignments.
A lot of young girls look up to me.
NA : Well the Yemen Times , across 20 years , has been through so much.
And very , very difficult times.
Today , we are in a much better situation.
And this is probably something I ' m going to share with you in Western media probably -- and how there ' s a lot of stereotypes -- thinking of Yemen in one single frame : this is what Yemen is all about.
And I just wanted to share with you : there ' s one reporter that came.
Yeah , break dancing.
Actually , that ' s a documentary that ' s available online ; the video ' s online.
And it definitely does give a different image of Yemen.
So it ' s about the lack of research , basically.
I am an example , and there are others like me.
But after the two years , which is a price we are willing to pay , we are going to stand up again on our feet , but in the new Yemen with a younger and more empowered people -- democratic.

You ' ll never sing again , said her doctor . But in a story from the very edge of medical possibility , operatic soprano Charity Tillemann-Dick tells a double story of survival -- of her body , from a double lung transplant , and of her spirit , fueled by an unwavering will to sing . A powerful story from TEDMED 2010.
You may not know this , but you are celebrating an anniversary with me.
It happens when there ' s a thickening in the pulmonary veins , making the right side of the heart work overtime , and causing what I call the reverse-Grinch effect.
She said ,  " Those high notes are going to kill you. " 
And just because of someone ' s hunch , I wasn ' t going to give it up.
It ' s a mile high , and I grew up there with my 10 brothers and sisters and two adoring parents.
And I gave up salt , I went vegan , and I started taking huge doses of sildenafil , also known as Viagra.
Mine was 146.
This is a list of the side effects : if you eat too much salt , like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich , you ' ll probably end up in the ICU.
No one wants to go on Flolan.
The pump was a little bit problematic when performing , so I ' d attach it to my inner thigh with the help of the girdle and an ACE bandage.
A few days after arriving , I met this wonderful , old conductor who started casting me in all of these roles.
He was a big figure in all of our lives , and we loved him very much.
At 24 , my death would have been entirely expected.
But soon I was showing signs of right-heart failure , and I had to return to sea level , doing so knowing that I probably would never see my home again.
My fingers started turning blue , and I was like ,  " What is going on here ?  " 
I was dying , and if I didn ' t mix that stuff up fast , I would never leave that apartment alive.
Thankfully , in a few minutes , I saw the signature hive-like rash appear on my legs , which is a side effect of the medication , and I knew I ' d be okay.
My doctor wanted me to get on the list for a lung transplant.
I wanted to live.
He said ,  " Be happy.
And it was right-heart failure.
It was my doctor in Cleveland , Marie Budev.
And everybody was really happy for me , but me.
The last thing I remember was lying on a white blanket , telling my surgeon that I needed to see my mother again , and to please try and save my voice.
They left my chest open for two weeks.
I had hoped my voice would be saved , but my doctors knew that the breathing tubes going down my throat might have already destroyed it.
So my own surgeon performed the procedure in a last-ditch attempt to save my voice.
I was 95 lbs.
But life isn ' t really just about avoiding death , is it ? 
My parents were totally stressed out about me going and auditioning and traveling and performing all over the place , but they knew that it was much better for me to do that than be preoccupied with my own mortality all of the time.
When we do , we will find that patients don ' t just survive ; we thrive.
Thank you so much.

It ' s interesting , because it was six years ago when I was pregnant with my first child that I discovered that the most commonly used preservative in baby care products mimics estrogen when it gets into the human body.
And it doesn ' t take much time to discover some really astonishing statistics with this issue.
So for example , in the United Kingdom , the incidence of childhood leukemia has risen by 20 percent just in a generation.
Again , similar story around the world.
Interestingly , one of those birth defects has seen a 200 percent increase in the U.S.
Frogs.
In 2003 , after my studies , it was banned in the European Union , but in that same year , the United States EPA re-registered the compound.
In some cases , another species like the North American Leopard Frog showed that males exposed to atrazine grew eggs in their testes.
So these are actually two brothers consummating a relationship.
But what atrazine does is it turns on an enzyme , the machinery if you will , aromatase , that converts testosterone into estrogen.
So when you develop a cancerous cell in your breast , aromatase converts androgens into estrogens , and that estrogen turns on or promotes the growth of that cancer so that it turns into a tumor and spreads.
And so I find it interesting that instead of treating this disease by preventing exposure to the chemicals that promote it , we simply respond by putting more chemicals into the environment.
And what ' s interesting about BPA is that it ' s such a potent estrogen that it was actually once considered for use as a synthetic estrogen in hormone placement therapy.
And for those of you who are not parents , sippy cups are those little plastic things that your child graduates to after using bottles.
The baby bottle scenario proves that we can prevent unnecessary exposure.
Scientists agree now.
In part , amphibians are good indicators and more sensitive because they don ' t have protection from contaminants in the water -- no eggshells , no membranes and no placenta.
The evidence of that is that studies in rats , again with atrazine , show that the hormone imbalance atrazine generates causes abortion.
And as a result , when those rats grow up , their pups experience retarded growth and development because they can ' t make enough milk to nourish their pups.
In addition to that , after the baby ' s born , our other unique invention as mammals is that we nourish our offspring after they ' re born.
And it ' s interesting when you make a film like this , because you ' re stuck trying to visualize science that there ' s no visualization for.
Oh what ? 
Never heard of it.
Child : Today , I had some octyphenols , some artificial musks and some bisphenol A.
We are in effect polluting our children.
And so when Tyrone talks about the fetus being trapped in a contaminated environment , this is my contaminated environment.
And perhaps it ' s the connection to our next generation -- like my wife and my beautiful daughter here about 13 years ago -- perhaps it ' s that connection that makes women activists in this particular area.
And of course , we don ' t do these experiments in humans , but just by coincidence , my colleague has shown that men who have low sperm count , low semen quality have significantly more atrazine in their urine.
Of course , most of them , 90 percent are Mexican , Mexican-American.
It shouldn ' t come to any surprise that the things that happen in wildlife are also a warning to us , just like Rachel Carson and others have warned.
The problem is , in my village , Oakland , in most of our villages , we don ' t see that connection.
We know so much about global warming and climate change , and yet , we have no concept of what I ' ve been calling internal environmentalism.
http://www.ted.com/talks/capt_charles_moore_on_the_seas_of_plastic.html
Capt . Charles Moore on the seas of plastic
Life Magazine helped in this effort by announcing the introduction of throwaways that would liberate the housewife from the drudgery of doing dishes.
A teacher told me how to express the under-five-percent of plastics recovered in our waste stream.
Plastic is not purified by the re-melting process like glass and metal.
Here is the accumulation at Biona Creek next to the L.A . airport.
Here is a remote island repository for bottles off the coast of Baja California.
Also , the caps are produced in separate factories from a different plastic , polypropylene.
After ten years , a lot of the Japanese caps are in what we call the Eastern Garbage Patch , while ours litter the Philippines.
Hundreds of thousands of the goose-sized chicks are dying with stomachs full of bottle caps and other rubbish , like cigarette lighters ...
This is Mae West , still alive at a zookeeper ' s home in New Orleans.
I got plenty of takers.
I separated them by color and put them on display the next Earth Day at Cabrillo Marine Aquarium in San Pedro.
Here ' s what our trawl samples from the plastic soup our ocean has become look like.
And this particular beach is Kailua Beach , the beach where our president and his family vacationed before moving to Washington.
We wanted to see if the most common fish in the deep ocean , at the base of the food chain , was ingesting these poison pills.
But no fishmonger on Earth can sell you a certified organic wild-caught fish.
We have to throw it away.
Narrator  : The levels are increasing , the amount of packaging is increasing , the  " throwaway "  concept of living is proliferating , and it ' s showing up in the ocean.
And in a plastic-wrapped and packaged world , he doesn ' t hold out much hope for that , either.
By the end of this talk , there will be 864 more hours of video on YouTube and 2.5 million more photos on Facebook and Instagram . So how do we sort through the deluge ?  At the TEDSalon in London , Markham Nolan shares the investigative techniques he and his team use to verify information in real-time , to let you know if that Statue of Liberty image has been doctored or if that video leaked from Syria is legitimate.
I ' ve been a journalist now since I was about 17 , and it ' s an interesting industry to be in at the moment , because as you all know , there ' s a huge amount of upheaval going on in media , and most of you probably know this from the business angle , which is that the business model is pretty screwed , and as my grandfather would say , the profits have all been gobbled up by Google.
And the audience for such a long time was in a position where they didn ' t have any way of affecting news or making any change . They couldn ' t really connect.
So I wrote a letter.
And that ' s changed now because , as journalists , we interact in real time . We ' re not in a position where the audience is reacting to news.
To give an example of how we rely on the audience , on the 5th of September in Costa Rica , an earthquake hit.
Thirty seconds later , the first message went onto Twitter , and this was someone saying  " temblor, "  which means earthquake.
And what that means is just constant , huge volumes of data going up.
More than three and a half thousand photos go up onto Facebook.
And that goes for every single person in this room.
We had to deal with composite images that were merging photos from previous storms.
They weren ' t really sure . It was filtered in Instagram.
They were well respected . They were known.
And finding the source becomes more and more important -- finding the good source -- and Twitter is where most journalists now go.
And how do you build a list like that from scratch ? 
And it ' s an amazing way of visualizing the conversation , but what you get is hints at who is more interesting and who is worth investigating.
Let ' s see who they are. " 
You don ' t know if it ' s a scrape . You don ' t know if it ' s a re-upload.
Oh , shit!
So we set about going to work on this video , and the only thing that we had to go on was the username on the YouTube account.
The first one was called Spokeo , which allowed us to look for Rita Krills.
And we found a house with a swimming pool that looked remarkably like Rita ' s . So we went back to the video , and we had to look for clues that we could cross-reference.
So we were able to call Rita , clear the video , make sure that it had been shot , and then our clients were delighted because they were able to run it without being worried.
This is from Hama.
Three different sources said three different things about the bridge.
So that was the only one that gave us a clue.
It had black-and-white curbs.
So onto Google Maps we go , and we start looking through literally every single bridge.
So we go a bit further . We switch to the satellite view , and we find another bridge , and everything starts to line up.
And it ' s got the black-and-white curbs that we saw in the video , and as we click through it , you can see someone ' s uploaded photos to go with the map , which is very handy , so we click into the photos . And the photos start showing us more detail that we can cross-reference with the video.
So what does that tell me ?  I ' ve got to go back now to my three sources and look at what they told me : the one who said the bridge didn ' t exist , the one who said the bridge wasn ' t in Hama , and the one guy who said ,  " Yes , the bridge does exist , but I ' m not sure about the water levels. " 
But what it tells me is that , at a time when there ' s more -- there ' s a greater abundance of information than there ever has been , it ' s harder to filter , we have greater tools.
They ' re yes or no , they ' re black or white.
Thanks very much.

Its species name is Sequoia sempervirens.
These are trees that would stand out in midtown Manhattan.
The largest individuals of this species , the dreadnoughts of their kind , live just on the north coast of California , where the rain is really intense.
Redwood rainforest is incredibly difficult to move through , and even today , individual trees are being discovered that have never been seen before , including , in the summer of 2006 , Hyperion , the world ' s tallest tree.
It ' s a kind loaner from TED.
Chris , could you extend your arm out that way ?  There we go . OK.
The Redwood species seems to exist in another kind of time : not human time , but what we might call Redwood time.
It dwells in the Grove of Titans on the north coast , and was discovered in 1998.
Steve Sillett and Marie Antoine are the principal explorers of the Redwood forest canopy . They ' re world-class athletes , and they also are world-class forest ecology scientists.
He climbed up a small tree next to this giant Redwood , and then he leaped through space and grabbed a branch with his hands , and ended up hanging , like catching a bar of a trapeze.
And when Marwood made the jump , he was covered with wasps stinging him in the face and eyes . He nearly let go.
After three books on this , it got to be a bit much , in a way.
That ' s my son , Oliver.
All other primates , when they ' re scared , they run up a tree , where they feel safe.
Looking out of a tree boat in the morning and hearing birdsong coming in three dimensions around us.
When Steve Sillett gets up into a big Redwood , he fires an arrow , which trails a fishing line , which gets over a branch in the tree , and then you ascend up a rope which has been dragged into the tree by the line.
You do feel a sense of exposure.
And all of a sudden , you lose sight of the ground , and you also lose sight of the sky , and you ' re in a three-dimensional labyrinth in the air filled with hanging gardens of ferns growing out of soil , which is populated with all kinds of small organisms.
When you get near the top of the tree , you feel like you can ' t fall -- in fact , it ' s difficult to move.
Maria ' s sitting on one of them.
Redwoods have an enormous surface area that extends upward into space because they have a propensity to do something called reiteration.
This buttress is less than halfway up the tree.
This three-dimensional map of the crown structure of a Redwood named Iluvatar , made by Steve Sillett , Marie Antoine and their colleagues , gives you an idea.
I ' ve wanted to ask Craig Venter if it would be possible to insert a synthetic chromosome into a human so that we could reiterate ourselves if we wanted to.
To reiterate the point , let ' s go closer into Iluvatar.
There are four humans in this shot -- one , two , three , four.
Flying buttresses , just as in a cathedral , help strengthen the crown of the tree and help the tree exist longer through time.
They also have the ability to put roots anywhere in the tree itself.
This is an unnamed species of copepod . A copepod is a crustacean.
But as you go and you look closer at a tree , what you see is , you see increasing complexity.
As you look at a tree , it takes a magnifying glass to see a giant tree.
In the 1950s , a small organism appeared in Richmond , Virginia , called the Hemlock woolly adelgid.
I hadn ' t even known that there were rainforests in the east , but in Great Smoky Mountains National Park it can rain up to 100 inches of rain a year.
It ' s absolutely heartbreaking to see.
The flickering , transitory quality of human time and the brevity of human life -- the necessity to love.
Exploring with them the forest canopy has been one of the most lovely things of my existence on Earth.
Richard Preston : Yes , that is correct . I mentioned Hyperion , the world ' s tallest tree.
And in subsequent climbs they could never find that ant again , and so no specimens have ever been collected.
It ' s an amazing sense of wonder you ' ve given me , and a sense of just how fragile this whole thing is.
You can think of the Earth ' s biosphere as a palace , and the continents are rooms in the palace , and the islands are small rooms.
http://www.ted.com/talks/mikko_hypponen_fighting_viruses_defending_the_net.html
Mikko Hypponen : Fighting viruses , defending the net
Think about all the services we use , all the connectivity , all the entertainment , all the business , all the commerce.
I ' ve spent my career fighting these problems.
It ' s the first virus we ever found for PC computers.
All right.
In fact , there ' s a phone number and an address in Pakistan.
The PC virus problem is 25 years old now.
Here ' s a typical street view.
Basit and Amjad ; they are still there.
Now of course , we had a very interesting discussion.
So there is some sort of justice in the world after all.
So let me just mount some drives . Go over there.
And you can see at the top of the screen , there ' s a centipede scrolling across your computer when you get infected by this one.
And the last example , guess what the Walker virus does ? 
Today , viruses are a global problem.
Here ' s the latest virus we ' ve found , in a file called Server.exe.
And that ' s the last 20 minutes of malware every single day.
This is a website operating in Moscow where these guys are buying infected computers.
Well there ' s multiple different ways , such as banking trojans , which will steal money from your online banking accounts when you do online banking , or keyloggers.
Every single email you write is saved and sent to the criminals.
And here ' s an example of a file we found from a server a couple of weeks ago.
We now have a whole underground marketplace and business ecosystem built around online crime.
They are both right now on the run.
And that means that the online criminals can actually afford to invest into their attacks.
I mean , the Internet is international.
So you just can ' t shut these guys down.
So how do you actually go around finding online criminals ? 
Here , I ' m looking at the Hex dump of an image file , which contains an exploit.
It has been encrypted with XOR function 97.
And I know , it doesn ' t really look much different from the original.
But even more interestingly , if we continue decrypting , we ' ll find this mysterious string , which says O600KO78RUS.
So obviously I Googled for it.
And 78 is the city code for the city of St . Petersburg.
And on this blog , he blogs about his life , about his life in St . Petersburg -- he ' s in his early 20s -- about his cat , about his girlfriend.
How do I know about this car ? 
And he put blogged images about the car accident -- that ' s his Mercedes -- right here is the Lada Samara he crashed into.
So what happens when online criminals are caught ? 
The local police don ' t act , or if they do , there ' s not enough evidence , or for some reason we can ' t take them down.
So if you look at what Stuxnet did is that it infected these.
PLC ' s , these small boxes which have no display , no keyboard , which are programmed , are put in place , and they do their job.
I mean , we have critical infrastructure.
We have become very reliant on Internet , on basic things like electricity , obviously , on computers working.
It ' s actually very basic stuff -- thinking about continuity , thinking about backups , thinking about the things that actually matter.
I see beauty in the future of the Internet , but I ' m worried that we might not see that.
We have to do this globally , and we have to do it right now.
We have to find the people with the skills , but without the opportunities and give them the opportunities to use their skills for good.
507
And the reason that we need to use science is because then we can reproduce what we ' re doing ; it ' s not just wisdom or guesswork.
There are lots of thing that the approach I take can predict , and there are some that it can ' t.
I actually get phone calls from people who want to know what lottery numbers are going to win.
Now , what is game theory about ? 
And they have beliefs about what other people want , and what other people don ' t want , how much power other people have , how much those people could get in the way of whatever it is that you want.
You know , what if people are rational ? 
I think there are only two exceptions that I ' m aware of -- two-year-olds , they are not rational , they have very fickle preferences , they switch what they think all the time , and schizophrenics are probably not rational , but pretty much everybody else is rational.
And many of you may have noticed that doesn ' t have as big an effect , as perhaps you would like it to have.
That person surrounds himself or herself with advisers.
Each of those people in turn has advisers who advise them , so they can advise the president.
Imagine a problem with just five decision-makers.
And Harry wants to know what each of those people are saying to each other , and so on , and Sally would like to know what Harry thinks those people are saying.
Now you may be surprised to know that smart people can keep 120 things straight in their head.
To 1,200 ?  No.
They can keep this information straight and that means that we can process the information.
This is an assessment by the Central Intelligence Agency of the percentage of time that the model I ' m talking about is right in predicting things whose outcome is not yet known , when the experts who provided the data inputs got it wrong.
We do need to know who has a stake in trying to shape the outcome of a decision.
And how much clout could they bring to bear if they chose to engage on the issue ? 
And so we have to figure out how they balance those two things.
You might notice what we don ' t need to know : there ' s no history in here.
So where are we going to get this information ? 
Let me make three important predictions -- you can check this out , time will tell.
And everybody ' s best friend , Ahmadinejad . How are things going for him ? 
I ' ve taken inputs on positions and so forth , run it through a computer model that had simulated the dynamics of interaction , and these are the simulated dynamics , the predictions about the path of policy.
That ' s where , according to my analyses , the Iranians were at the beginning of this year.
And down at 100 they would build civilian nuclear energy , which is what they say is their objective.
That ' s not going to be happening , but you can see that the line comes down faster if they ' re not put under international pressure , if they ' re allowed to pursue their own devices.
How is this happening ? 
That power disappears completely ; nobody supports that by 2011.
These folks are the moneyed interests in Iran , the bankers , the oil people , the bazaaries.
Here is Mr . Ahmadinejad.
Everything is not predictable : the stock market is , at least for me , not predictable , but most complicated negotiations are predictable.
I would like to leave you with one thought , which is for me , the dominant theme of this gathering , and is the dominant theme of this way of thinking about the world.
I love that you put it out there.
It would be a good thing if people paid more attention , took seriously , and engaged in the same sorts of calculations , because it would change things . But it would change things in two beneficial ways.
CA : So you ' re kind of trying to say ,  " People of Iran , this is your destiny , lets go there. " 
http://www.ted.com/talks/tony_robbins_asks_why_we_do_what_we_do.html
Tony Robbins asks why we do what we do
I ' m not exaggerating . I do weekends , and what I do -- I do even more than that , obviously , coach people -- but I ' m into immersion . Because how did you learn language ? 
And I say ,  " Well , that ' s interesting . That ' s not what I do. " 
Or are you running the same pattern ?  Because I believe that the invisible force of internal drive , activated , is the most important thing in the world.
I don ' t know about another category , but we all know how to think.
You don ' t work in your self-interest all the time , because when emotion comes into it , the wiring changes in the way it functions.
They ' re only going to get magnified by the very technology that ' s connecting us , because it ' s making us intersect . And that intersection doesn ' t always create the view of  " everybody now understands everybody , and everybody appreciates everybody. " 
I ' ve got to produce the result now.
So , when I get those calls about performance , that ' s one thing.
That ' s  " How do you take the invisible and make it visible, "  right ? 
Because science is easy , right ? 
So , I ' ve had an interesting laboratory to try to answer the question of the real question , which is what ' s the difference in somebody ' s life if you look at somebody like those people that you ' ve given everything to ?  Like all the resources they say they need . You gave them not a 100-dollar computer ; you gave them the best computer . You gave them love ; you gave them joy . You were there to comfort them.
What is it that shapes us ?  And we live in a therapy culture.
The past equals the future . And of course it does if you live there.
How many have ever failed to achieve something significant in your life ?  Say ,  " Aye. " 
Somebody who ' s working for you , you know , or a partner , or even yourself . When you fail to achieve a goal , what ' s the reason people say they fail to achieve ? 
TR : And -- and -- -- what do all those , including the Supreme Court , have in common ? 
The defining factor is never resources ; it ' s resourcefulness.
And the way that it came across to some people on that day -- because I know people that wanted to vote in your direction and didn ' t , and I was upset . But there was emotion that was there.
Audience : Yes.
They tell us we don ' t have the resources , but ultimately , if you take a look here -- flip it up , if you would -- they say , what are all the reasons they haven ' t accomplished that ? 
Right now , you have to decide what you ' re going to focus on.
So , think about your own life , the decisions that have shaped your destiny.
TR : So the bottom line is , maybe it was where to go to work , and you met the love of your life there.
When a woman stands up and says ,  " No , I won ' t go to the back of the bus, "  she didn ' t just affect her life . That decision shaped our culture.
Different than most people . What did it mean ? 
You see that South America and Africa may be connected in a certain way , right ?  Other people say ,  " Oh , that sounds ridiculous. "  It ' s simple . So , what shaped Lance ? 
Say ,  " Aye. " 
Your model of the world is the filter . That ' s what ' s shaping us.
First , what ' s your target ?  What are you after ? 
TR : So , it ' s needs we have . I believe there are six human needs.
Let me tell you what they are . First one : certainty.
And if you got totally certain , ironically , even though we all need that -- like if you ' re not certain about your health , or your children , or money , you don ' t think about much.
Bored out of your minds . So , God , in Her infinite wisdom , gave us a second human need , which is uncertainty.
The ones you don ' t want you call problems , but you need them.
You can do it by being more spiritual.
Who knows what ' s going to happen next ?  Kind of exciting.
Now , you can get significance a million ways , but to be significant , you ' ve got to be unique and different.
If you don ' t raise your hand , you ' ll have had other shit too , come on.
If nothing else works for you , get a dog . Don ' t get a cat . Get a dog , because if you leave for two minutes , it ' s like you ' ve been gone for six months when you show back up again five minutes later , right ? 
And this is where fulfillment comes . You won ' t get fulfillment from the first four . You ' ll figure a way -- smoke , drink , do whatever -- to meet the first four , but the last two -- number five : you must grow . We all know the answer here.
And it ' s exciting . When you see Nicholas up here talking about his $100 computer , the most passionate exciting thing is : here ' s a genius , but he ' s got a calling now.
What does it mean ?  I ' m worthless . What ' ve I got to do ? 
I don ' t even know who it is. "  My father always said ,  " No one gives a shit. "  And all of a sudden , somebody I don ' t know , they ' re not asking for anything , they ' re just giving our family food , looking out for us . It made me believe this :  " What does it mean that strangers care ?  "  And what that made me decide is , if strangers care about me and my family , I care about them.
Next year eight . I wasn ' t doing it for brownie points , but after eight , I thought , shit , I could use some help.
It ' s been fantastic.
And as you move in a direction , you have a destination or destiny.
And the last one I ' ve already mentioned , that fell to you.
Now , here ' s what I ' ll tell you about emotion . There are 6,000 emotions that we all have words for in the English language , which is just a linguistic representation , right , that changes by language . But if your dominant emotions -- if I had more time , I have 20,000 people or 1,000 , and I have them write down all the emotions that they experience in an average week , and I gave them as long as they needed , and on one side they write empowering emotions , the other ' s disempowering -- guess how many emotions people experience ?  Less than 12.
How may know somebody like this ?  Come on.
Her friend , her new boyfriend , wanted to marry her , and she said no.
And she played the recording for us in the room.
10 seconds.
What does this mean and what are we going to do ?  " 
And I took these two men and did what I call an indirect negotiation.
It ' s the only way our world ' s going to change . God bless you.
Talks
The year is 1963.
It ' s a stretch of beach we know so well.
These women are descendants of Polynesian navigators , trained in the old ways by their elders , and now they ' re passing it on to me.
They begin to chant.
 " Baby girl , someday the world will be in trouble.
It will sometimes be a lonely road.
It will take all of you. " 
I ' m on a remote island in Micronesia.
Mau is a palu , a navigator priest.
They could synthesize patterns in nature using the rising and setting of stars , the sequence and direction of waves , the flight patterns of certain birds.
It is the most accurate place to feel the rhythm and sequence and direction of waves.
The palu also had an uncanny ability to forecast weather conditions days in advance.
We are in such a critical moment of our collective history.
This is part of our collective narrative.
Just as the women in Hawaii that raised me predicted , the world is in trouble.
An African shaman said ,  " Your society worships the jester while the king stands in plain clothes. " 
Mau passed away five months ago , but his legacy and lessons live on.
And I realize through a lesson that he shared that we continue to find our way.
This whole notion of every man for himself is completely unsustainable.
It ' s the most important map of all.
art,arts,business,creativity,culture,entertainment,law,technology,video
Whether you ' re an artist , a technologist , a lawyer or a fan , the handling of copyright directly impacts your life.
Two years ago , recording artist Chris Brown released the official video of his single  " Forever. " 
Well , it starts with content owners delivering assets into our database , along with a usage policy that tells us what to do when we find a match.
The system compares every moment of one to the other to see if there ' s a match.
When we find a match , we apply the policy that the rights owner has set down.
It would be like 36,000 people staring at 36,000 monitors each and every day , without so much as a coffee break.
Remember Chris Brown ' s video  " Forever "  ? 
What ' s amazing about this is , if the processional of the wedding was this much fun , can you imagine how much fun the reception must have been ? 
And instead of Sony blocking , they allowed the upload to occur.
And Jill and Kevin , the happy couple , they came back from their honeymoon and found that their video had gone crazy viral.
Because it ' s not just amateurs borrowing from big studios , but sometimes big studios borrowing back.
It ' s because it ' s a big problem , and it ' s complicated and messy.
And each of these can vary by country.
But the system only works through the participation of rights owners.
But it ' s not just about dollars and impressions.
For his first studio album release in decades , musical innovator Thomas Dolby has been composing music in the uniquely inspirational setting of a restored life-boat . Here he premieres a gorgeous , evocative song from that album -- about one night with a legend . He ' s backed by members of the modern string quartet Ethel.
I ' ve been playing TED for nearly a decade , and I ' ve very rarely played any new songs of my own.
And , so now , when the polar ice caps melt , my recording studio will rise up like an ark , and I ' ll float off into the drowned world like a character from a J.G . Ballard novel.
And so I go in there until the early hours of the morning , and I work on new songs.
But I know where she was.
http://www.ted.com/talks/jonathan_harris_tells_the_web_s_secret_stories.html
Jonathan Harris : the Web ' s secret stories
I do this because I think that people actually have a lot in common.
There ' s language gaps , there ' s ethnicity and racial gaps , there ' s age gaps , there ' s gender gaps , there ' s sexuality gaps , there ' s wealth and money gaps , there ' s education gaps , there ' s also religious gaps.
I think this is a very old human desire . It ' s nothing new.
What ' s new is that in the last several years a lot of these very traditional physical human activities , these acts of self-expression , have been moving onto the Internet.
This is a piece that every two or three minutes scans the world ' s newly-posted blog entries for occurrences of the phrases  " I feel "  or  " I am feeling. " 
It ' s been running for about a year and a half.
The color of each particle corresponds to the type of feeling inside -- so that happy , positive feelings are brightly colored.
So it gets pretty hot and steamy sometimes in the world of human emotions.
You can see a few of them are swarming around the cursor right now.
Murmurs causes all of the feelings to fly to the ceiling.
 " I feel gypped out of something awesome here. " 
The next movement is called Montage.
We see ,  " I just feel like I ' m not going to have fun if it ' s not the both of us. "  That was from someone in Michigan.
Mobs provides different statistical breakdowns of the population of the world ' s feelings in the last few hours.
We can do an age breakdown , which gives us a histogram of the world ' s emotional distribution by age.
The rainy ones fall down as if they ' re in a rainstorm , and the snowy ones kind of flutter to the ground.
They ' re feeling  " warm "  at 2.9 times the normal level , and so on.
It ' s a bit different from the others.
And then if I go over here , the list begins to scroll , and there are actually thousands of feelings that have been collected.
For instance , you could find women who feel  " addicted "  in their 20s when it was cloudy in Bangladesh.
 " I need to be in some backwoods redneck town so that I can feel beautiful. " 
 " I feel these weirdoes are actually an asset to college life. " 
And because of that , you end up getting very honest , candid , sincere responses that are often very moving.
And this is a technique that I explored in a different project , the Yahoo! Time Capsule , which was designed to take a fingerprint of the world in 2006.
It ' s a spinning globe , the surface of which is entirely composed of the pictures and words and drawings of people that submitted to the time capsule.
There are two modes to the time capsule.
You can see the orange line leaving the desert floor at about a 45 degree angle there . This was amazing because the first night I looked at all this information and really started seeing the gaps that I talked about earlier -- the differences in age , gender and wealth and so on.
And there was something very moving about all of this human expression being shot off into the night sky.
You know , Orion facing the roaring bull.
And it caused me to wonder about our world today.
And those are the questions that inspired my new project , which is debuting here today at TED.
So , it ' s my great pleasure now to show this to you.
Now , these aren ' t just little points of light , little pixels.
And we see here a photograph with a head.
This is the universe of 2007 , the last two months.
So we can see where it ' s emerging here , like President Ford , Iraq , Bush . And we can actually isolate just the words -- I call them secrets -- and we can cause them to form an alphabetical list . And we see Anna Nicole Smith playing a big role recently.
And the things that relate to Ford enter its orbit and swirl around it.
We can click on this and we see this iconic image of Betty Ford kissing her husband ' s coffin.
So , if we want to , let ' s check out what Bill Clinton ' s universe looks like.
We can pull out his secrets , and we see that it has a lot to do with candidates , Hillary , presidential , Barack Obama.
You can see that this is an important story ; there are a lot of things in its orbit . If we open this up , we get different perspectives on this story.
We can see he ' s been focused in America because he ' s been campaigning , probably , but a little bit of action over here in the Middle East.
So if I put in climate change for all of 2006 , we ' ll see what that universe looks like.
And there are also quotes that you can see , if you ' re interested in reading about quotes on climate change.
This will be online in several days , probably next Tuesday.
So it ' s been a pleasure . Thank you very much.

And this is our beast of burden -- this is a Computer Tomography machine , a CT machine.
So this is a fantastic machine that we can use for improving health care , but as I said , it ' s also a challenge for us.
And let me step back in time.
That would correspond to about 50 megabytes of data , which is small when you think about the data we can handle today just on normal mobile devices.
So we ' re getting the dynamics out of the body as well.
So this is really the enormous challenge that we have.
There is the problem. " 
Imagine that you slice your body in all these directions , and then you try to put the slices back together again into a pile of data , into a block of data.
So what we need to do is to figure out a way of looking at the things we do want to look at and make things transparent that we don ' t want to look at.
Using computers , even though they ' re getting faster and better all the time , it ' s a challenge to deal with gigabytes of data , terabytes of data and extracting the relevant information.
So this is where this little dear comes into play.
She ' s only two years old , and she ' s having a blast.
So what ' s inside of this machine is what enables me to do the things that I ' m doing with the medical data.
I paid about one million dollars for that machine.
So this is really what ' s enabling us to deal with the explosion of data in medicine , together with some really nifty work in terms of algorithms -- compressing data , extracting the relevant information that people are doing research on.
It ' s a woman . You can see the hair.
But fully interactively on standard graphics cards on a normal computer , I can just put in a clip plane.
I can look at the skull structure , and I can see that , okay , this is where they opened up the skull on this woman , and that ' s where they went in.
And one of the applications that we ' ve been working on -- and this has gotten a little bit of traction worldwide -- is the application of virtual autopsies.
And you can see how I ' m gradually peeling off.
So this will be the typical workflow situation.
And then they decide what to do in the real physical autopsy after that.
And again , it ' s fully interactive , so you can rotate and you can look at things in real time on these systems here.
And this women also ended up under the car , so she ' s quite badly beaten up by this injury.
You can also see some of the artifacts from the teeth -- that ' s actually the filling of the teeth -- but because I ' ve set the functions to show me metal and make everything else transparent.
It ' s very interesting for us to be able to look at things like knife stabbings.
Here ' s another case that I think is interesting.
One of the things that I ' m really , really happy to be able to show you here today is our virtual autopsy table.
So we ' ve implemented all the gestures you can do on the table , and you can think of it as an enormous touch interface.
So if you have the opportunity , please try it out.
Okay , now that we ' re talking about touch , let me move on to really  " touching "  data.
It ' s a little mechanical pen that has very , very fast step motors inside of the pen.
I have this pen , and I look at the data , and I move the pen towards the head , and all of a sudden I feel resistance.
And then I can feel the brain inside , and this will be the slushy like this.
So just looking at this heart , I can play back a video here.
Then he can examine how the heart is moving.
So this is really neat.
MRI is using magnetic fields and radio frequencies to scan the brain , or any part of the body.
And you just saw Motts the research engineer , there , going into the MRI system , and he was wearing goggles.
He ' s seeing his own brain.
And this is something that we ' ve been researching for a little while.
And then he ' s going backwards.
You can also see that his visual cortex is activated in the back of the head , because that ' s where he ' s seeing , he ' s seeing his own brain.
So he ' s going like this.
And connecting also with the previous talk here , this is something that we could use as a tool to really understand how the neurons are working , how the brain is working , and we can do this with very , very high visual quality and very fast resolution.
So she came to the center , and they sedated her and then put her straight into the scanner.
I can look inside of it.
We can scan all sorts of things , all sorts of animals.
And the bear is a cuddly , friendly animal.
So with that , I ' d like to thank all the people who have helped me to generate these images.
So thank you very much.

I develop and test models of the Big Bang , using observational data.
And so it was simply astonishing to me to find an organization that actually appreciated both those sides.
Both were very young countries then , and full of hope for the future.
And after that -- there ' s nothing much to say about that.
But the kids were the best part.
And they weren ' t used to that.
He was the son of one of the poorest families in the village.
He said ,  " OK . I measured the height of a brick.
Another one is that I met a miner . He was home on his three-month leave from the mines.
And if Africa is going to get fixed , it ' s by them , not by us.
Well , I ' m not going to explain this equation , but theoretical physics is really an amazing subject.
So it ' s not the final story , but it ' s an incredibly powerful summary of everything we know about nature at the most basic level.
And when I try to explain my work to her , she waved away all the details , and she said ,  " Neil , there ' s only one question that really matters.
The standard explanation is that the universe somehow sprang into existence , full of a strange kind of energy -- inflationary energy -- which blew it up.
The alternative is that the Big Bang wasn ' t the beginning.
It ' s all I can convey . According to these theories , there are extra dimensions of space , not just the three we ' re familiar with , but at every point in the room there are more dimensions.
And a tiny distance away , there ' s another sheet , also three-dimensional , and they ' re separated by a gap.
Well , I got interested in this because it seemed to me that it was an obvious question.
The conventional picture of the Big Bang is a point.
The density of matter is finite , and we have a chance of a consistent set of equations that can describe the whole process.
It involves gravitational waves.
And maybe we live in an endless universe.
And we try to convince ourselves -- we really try to convince ourselves they ' re wrong.
What about Africa ? 
This is very graphically shown by the Worldmapper website and project.
And the next map now shows Africa ' s GDP in 1960 , around the time of independence for many African states.
Then there ' s HIV/AIDS . And then there are deaths from war.
Well , here ' s the number of physicians in Africa.
And this was very eloquently argued at TED Africa : that all of the aid that ' s been given has completely failed to put Africa onto its own two feet.
And while I was busy working -- I was working on these colliding worlds , in the day.
So I had an idea . And the idea was very simple.
And to my astonishment , they backed me 100 percent.
It ' s an 80-room Art Deco hotel from the 1920s.
And those of you who haven ' t been there , you should go.
Even though the Internet is very expensive all over Africa , there are Internet cafes everywhere.
And we got lots of applicants.
So we designed it to have interactive teaching.
The students don ' t usually leave the computer lab till 2 or 3 a.m.
They ' ll publish , be invited to conferences.
And where they are is indicated over here.
But more important , the pan-African student body is a continual source of strength , pride and commitment to Africa.
So here is where we were after the first graduation in 2004.
We had some of the students filmed at home before they came to AIMS.
I will be attending AIMS.
And I ' ll let her take it from there.
Professor : Tendai is working very independently.
NT : Another student in the first year of AIMS was Shehu.
He ' s about to finish his Ph.D. , and he was filmed recently with someone you all know.
So now I ' m going to get to my TED business.
So , we were having a party , as you can see they ' re completely eclipsing me at this point.
This is Lydia . Lydia is the first ever woman to graduate in mathematics in the Central African Republic.
And our wish has two parts : one is a dream and the other ' s a plan . OK.
Well , I said we also have a plan . And our plan is quite simple.
Each will have a pan-African student body , but specialize in a different area of science.
The expanded AIMS will be a coherent pan-African institution , and its graduates will form a powerful network , working together for peace and progress across the continent.
And our partners across Africa are extremely enthusiastic about this.
It won ' t be easy.
And we summarize them this way : the institutes have got to be relevant , innovative , cost-effective and high quality . Why ? 
By unlocking and nurturing their creative potential , we can create a step change in Africa ' s future.
brain,complexity,computers,design,engineering,science,technology,visualizations
You could play games with it . You could program it in BASIC.
And I thought to myself , this CPU really has to work like crazy just to keep all this data moving through the system.
This is a quote , actually , from Alan Turing :  " In 30 years , it will be as easy to ask a computer a question as to ask a person. " 
Let ' s take a look at some numbers.
So that would be really great , if you could add that to the production capacity in Tanzania.
Now , let ' s compare this with the brain.
So that ' s true love , right there.
And it ' s actually as much as your laptop computer : it ' s just 10 watts.
How is the brain able to do this ? 
They are called neurons.
And that ' s basically what ' s going on in your brain right now as you ' re watching this.
The net is doing the work in the brain.
So I ' m not the first to figure this out . This is a quote from Brian Eno :  " the problem with computers is that there is not enough Africa in them. " 
This is -- it ' s actually really this remarkable convergence between the devices that we use to compute in computers , and the devices that our brains use to compute.
And what you have here is , when you actually turn on the gate , you get an increase in the amount of current , and you get a steady flow of current.
In fact , they are starting to behave like the device that neurons use to compute , which is called an ion channel.
And these are individual potassium ions that are flowing through that pore.
So , what you have is that when the pore is open , you get some current sometimes.
And the reason why that ' s happening is that , right now , in 2007 -- the technology that we are using -- a transistor is big enough that several electrons can flow through the channel simultaneously , side by side.
This is what Intel does to keep adding more cores onto the chip.
And you start having the same kind of traffic jams that you have in the ion channel.
And the only kind of thing -- the only thing we know right now that can compute with these kinds of devices are the brain.
And the way they represent information is they break up that data into little pieces that are represented by pulses and different neurons.
What you see here is that there ' s these redundant connections.
What you have here is a system where you store data locally.
And I ' m going to show you a system that we designed to model the retina , which is a piece of brain that lines the inside of your eyeball.
Instead of doing this in software , or doing those kinds of algorithms , we went and talked to neurobiologists who have actually reverse engineered that piece of brain that ' s called the retina.
It will give you the same kind of robust architecture that I described.
Let me explain what you ' re going to see , OK , because it ' s putting out different kinds of information , it ' s not as straightforward as a camera.
This is Kareem ' s dark eyes and that ' s the white background that you see here.
And these four types of information -- your optic nerve has about a million fibers in it , and 900,000 of those fibers send these four types of information.
And this is the same thing you see when people compress video to send : they want to make it very sparse , because that file is smaller . And this is what the retina is doing , and it ' s doing it just with the circuitry , and how this network of neurons that are interacting in there , which we ' ve captured on the chip.
Yes , so that ' s the idea.
There are these cells that detect change and you move your attention to it.
And what I would like us to do is put Africa in the computer , and come up with a new kind of computer that will generate thought , imagination , be creative and things like that.
Kwabena Boahen : Yes , like I said at the beginning , I got my first computer when I was a teenager , growing up in Accra.
I was coming at it from a different perspective , where I was bringing that different perspective to bear on the problem.
I think we can contribute . We can dream like everybody else.

This is the basic question of somebody who ' s interested in finding and studying black holes.
And the reason this is interesting is that it gives us an opportunity to prove whether or not these exotic objects really exist.
Well , in many ways a black hole is an incredibly simple object , because there are only three characteristics that you can describe : the mass , the spin , and the charge.
But today , the way I want you to understand a black hole , for the proof of a black hole , is to think of it as an object whose mass is confined to zero volume.
And that ' s named after the guy who recognized why it was such an important radius.
That means you , your neighbor , your cellphone , the auditorium can become a black hole if you can figure out how to compress it down to the size of the Schwarzschild radius.
And the object is forced to continue to collapse to an infinitely small object.
And it turns out that it ' s actually pretty simple to figure out.
So , if I were to take the sun and compress it down to the scale of the University of Oxford , it would become a black hole.
I need to understand the mass of the object I ' m claiming is a black hole , and what its Schwarzschild radius is.
Okay , so , I ' m going to talk about no ordinary black hole ; I ' m going to talk about supermassive black holes.
And inside that supernova remnant is going to be a little black hole that has a mass roughly three times the mass of the Sun.
And this beautiful picture taken with the Hubble Space Telescope shows you that galaxies come in all shapes and sizes.
And there are a hundred billion stars in that galaxy , just to give you a sense of scale.
I like to call these the prima donna of the galaxy world , because they are kind of show offs.
And yet , what we actually see is light that can ' t be explained by the starlight.
Again , a source of energy that ' s very difficult to explain if you just think that galaxies are composed of stars.
But it ' s a kind of indirect argument.
Because that is the way to suppress the energetic phenomena that we see in active galactic nuclei.
And that is because we live in a galaxy which has a flattened , disk-like structure.
And as you ' ll see in a moment , the ability to see detail is key to this experiment.
Stars will orbit the black hole in the very same way that planets orbit the sun.
So , if I know how fast it goes around , I know the mass.
So , this means that I want to see a lot of detail.
But it turns out these telescopes , or any telescope on the ground has had a little bit of a challenge living up to this campaign promise.
So , to give you a sense of what this is like , it ' s actually like looking at a pebble at the bottom of a stream.
And that buys us about a factor of 20.
So , without this technology you can ' t see the stars.
Now , in the next few slides I ' m just going to focus on that little square there.
So , we ' ve been doing this experiment for 15 years , and we see the stars go all the way around.
And to give you a sense of how short that is , the sun takes 200 million years to go around the center of the galaxy.
But it ' s the key to this experiment . The orbit tells me how much mass is inside a very small radius.
You can see a lot of stars.
To give you a sense of how small that size is , that ' s the size of our solar system.
And the truth is , I ' m not quite there.
So , what I want to tell you , very briefly , is a few examples of the excitement of what we can do today at the center of the galaxy , now that we know that there is , or at least we believe , that there is a supermassive black hole there.
You can ask ,  " What do you expect for the old stars , stars that have been around the center of the galaxy for a long time , they ' ve had plenty of time to interact with the black hole. " 
A black hole does not make a kind neighbor to a stellar nursery.
It strips that gas cloud apart.
So , what do we see ? 
So , you can already see the surprise.
And in fact , today , this is what we ' re trying to figure out , this mystery of how do you get -- how do you resolve this contradiction.
Because , in truth , while I said we ' re correcting for the Earth ' s atmosphere , we actually only correct for half the errors that are introduced.
So , we want to build a 30 meter telescope.
So , in conclusion , I ' m going to show you an animation that basically shows you how these orbits have been moving , in three dimensions.
And last but not least , none of this would have happened without the advent of the tremendous progress that ' s been made on the technology front.
In this epic overview , Michael Tilson Thomas traces the development of classical music through the development of written notation , the record , and the re-mix.
Well when I was asked to do this TEDTalk , I was really chuckled , because , you see , my father ' s name was Ted , and much of my life , especially my musical life , is really a talk that I ' m still having with him , or the part of me that he continues to be.
Because even through the squeaks of his hearing aids , his understanding of music was profound.
But he was tough when it came to music.
Both my parents really loved it.
One day in New York , I was on the street and I saw some kids playing baseball between stoops and cars and fire hydrants.
And he ran around the bases.
Well when it comes to classical music , there ' s an awful lot to pass on , much more than Mozart , Beethoven or Tchiakovsky.
It ' s all the anthems and dance crazes and ballads and marches.
It ' s so simple , so evocative.
And the pitches , the notes , as you know , are just vibrations.
And the way we react to them has changed radically over the centuries , as have our preferences for them.
Now your 21st century ears are quite happy with this last chord , even though a while back it would have puzzled or annoyed you or sent some of you running from the room.
In 200 B.C. , a man named Sekulos wrote this song for his departed wife and inscribed it on her gravestone in the notational system of the Greeks.
And in the 12th century , a line was drawn , like a musical horizon line , to better pinpoint the pitch ' s location.
And from this moment , classical music became what it most essentially is , a dialogue between the two powerful sides of our nature : instinct and intelligence.
Bach was like a great improviser with a mind of a chess master.
So in the first eight centuries or so of this tradition the big  ' what '  was to praise God.
This is the kind of music that Leonardo DaVinci would have known.
Ah , baleful stars!
And the how was harmony , stacking up the pitches to form chords.
It ' s just these two notes in the middle.
So you can see in a system like this there was enormous subtle potential of representing human emotions.
It ' s the time in which the big forms began to arise.
And in these big architectures of time , composers like Beethoven could share the insights of a lifetime.
Now this moment so fascinates me.
What sticks with people in the audience at the end of a performance ? 
It ' s the passing on part . It ' s the  ' why '  part of it.
And technology democratized music by making everything available.
The culture in which we live now is awash with music of improvisation that ' s been sliced , diced , layered and , God knows , distributed and sold.
What sticks with people ? 
He came over to a piano that was there , and he balanced himself and began playing something like this.
The symphony : Isaac Stern , the concerto , I heard it. " 
But now I ' m excited that there ' s more chance than ever before possible of sharing this music.
There ' s just a role here for so many people -- teachers , parents , performers -- to be explorers together.
You don ' t need to worry about knowing anything.
All that  ' what '  , all that  ' how '  is out there waiting for you to discover its  ' why '  , to dive in and pass it on.

And one day , a vessel not unlike this will probably break the world speed record.
So they knew at that stage they could carry large weights.
Then these two fellows came along , and they were flying kites to develop the control systems that would ultimately enable powered human flight.
But unfortunately , it relegated kites once again to be considered children ' s toys.
So turbines grew . And they can now span up to three hundred feet at the hub height , but they can ' t really go a lot higher , and more height is where the more wind is , and more power -- as much as twice as much.
The majority of it is in the higher altitudes , above 300 feet , where we don ' t have a technology as yet to get there.
As you can tell , you need to be a robot to fly this thing for thousands of hours.
And it doesn ' t hurt to do it in a location like this either.
And we ' re working towards megawatt-scale machines that fly at 2000 feet and generate tons of clean electricity.
Your Cessna would be 230 killowatts.
So that is audacious , you say . I agree.
By 1945 , they were making 100,000.
And I think we need to support all of the dreams of the kids out there doing these crazy things.
955
And I ' m also a little nervous about this.
It ' s a phenomenon that I think any organization or individual can tap into.
This kid is known online as Lil Demon.
Here ' s a clue.
It felt like a revolution.
So , this story of the evolution of dance seems strangely familiar.
It ' s not as if J.J . and Jill actually ended their talks saying ,  " Step your game up, "  but they might as well have.
And there are just three things you need for this thing to kick into gear.
The bigger the crowd , the more potential innovators there are.
You need clear , open visibility of what the best people in that crowd are capable of , because that is how you will learn how you will be empowered to participate.
Absent desire , not going to happen.
Best dancer walks tall , gets the best date.
There ' s millions connected.
But the desire element is really dialed way up.
So , this possibility of a new type of global recognition , I think , is driving huge amounts of effort.
So , this is a model that pretty much any organization could use to try and nurture its own cycle of crowd-accelerated innovation.
And , very happily , there ' s one class of people who really can ' t make use of this tool.
And if you can get that wheel to turn , look out.
By opening up our translation program , thousands of heroic volunteers -- some of them watching online right now , and thank you! -- have translated our talks into more than 70 languages , thereby tripling our viewership in non-English-speaking countries.
We ' re getting great talks back from them.
You know , we ' ve heard that this week -- this romantic notion of the lone genius with the  " eureka! "  moment that changes the world is misleading.
It ' s also not news to say that the Internet has accelerated innovation.
And that ' s why what I ' m excited about , and what I think is under-reported , is the significance of the rise of online video.
Suddenly , here we are.
I don ' t think it will be.
He ' s a unicyclist.
And a global community of unicyclists discover each other online , inspire each other to greatness.
But if Rube Goldberg machines and video poetry aren ' t quite your cup of tea , how about this.
Here ' s one such frustrated scientist , Moshe Pritsker , the founder of Jove.
So it ' s not far-fetched to say that , at some point , online video is going to dramatically accelerate scientific advance.
It ' s actually faster to read than to view.
And in that non-verbal portion , there ' s some serious magic.
Face-to-face communication has been fine-tuned by millions of years of evolution.
It ' s probably driven our culture for millennia.
The world ' s ambitious innovators and influencers now could get their ideas to spread far and wide , and so the art of the spoken word pretty much withered on the vine.
that just went global.
For the first time in human history , talented students don ' t have to have their potential and their dreams written out of history by lousy teachers.
Thousands of individuals and organizations are sharing their knowledge and data online.
Our future is many-to-many.
I mean , does it have to be this painful , top-down process ? 
We can ' t stop learning at age 21.
I mean , that would take more teachers than we ' ve ever had.
You ' re the teacher.
I mean , is it crazy to think that this girl , in the back , at the right , in 15 years , might be sharing the idea that keeps the world beautiful for your grandchildren ? 
I ' m one of the organizers of TEDxKibera.
The same spot , it was a crime spot where people were being robbed.
They are using Flip cameras to record , edit , and reporting to their own channel , Kibera TV.
My message to TEDGlobal and the entire world is : Kibera is a hotbed of innovation and ideas.
Right now , Chris and Kevin and Dennis and Dickson and their friends are watching us , in Nairobi , right now.
Pianist and composer Jennifer Lin gives a magical performance , talks about the process of creativity and improvises a moving solo piece based on a random sequence of notes.
Thank you very much.
And the song that I just played was by Józef Hofmann.
It ' s called  " Abegg Variations, "  by Robert Schumann , a German 19th century composer.
So , actually , if you listen carefully , there ' s supposed to be five variations on this Abegg theme.
So , I ' ll talk about musical composition , even though I don ' t know where to start.
And once I choose my main theme I have to decide , out of all the styles in music , what kind of style do I want ? 
They help me plan out the whole piece , and then the hard part is filling it in with musical ideas , because then you have to think.
And once I realized it , there ' s a parallel between creating music and creating art , because for your motive or your little initial idea for your drawing , it ' s your character -- you want to decide who do you want to draw , or if you want to draw an original character.
Am I going to use a two-page spread like a comic book for more grandiose effect , I guess ? 
You can ' t focus on what you ' re supposed to do.
I ' m not going to play my own composition today because , although I did finish it , it ' s way too long.
Nice to meet you.
Oh , D and F -- too familiar.
GH : OK . C , G , B , A and E.
Now , she chose C , G , B , A , E.
The next song , or the encore , that I ' m going to play is called  " Bumble Boogie, "  by Jack Fina.

And it got me wondering : If you took all this data and put it through statistical analysis , could you reverse engineer a TEDTalk ? 
Now , with the topic : There ' s a whole range of topics you can choose , but you should choose wisely , because your topic strongly correlates with how users will react to your talk.
Oh , well.
TED is famous for keeping a very sharp eye on the clock , so they ' re going to hate me for revealing this , because , actually , you should talk as long as they will let you.
Now , while ...
First of all , I must , as a speaker , provide a service to the audience and talk about what I will give you , instead of saying what I can ' t have.
You ' ll all stay with me.
And analysis shows if you want to be among the most favorite TED speakers , you should let your hair grow a little bit longer than average , make sure you wear your glasses and be slightly more dressed-up than the average TED speaker.
Color closely correlates with the ratings that talks get on the website.
So , now it ' s time to put it all together and design the ultimate TEDTalk.
You only have to make one decision , and that is : Are you going to use the white version for very good TEDTalks , about creativity , human genius ? 
I hope you enjoy designing your own ultimate and worst possible TEDTalks.
The leader of Britain ' s Conservative Party says we ' re entering a new era -- where governments themselves have less power and people empowered by technology have more . Tapping into new ideas on behavioral economics , he explores how these trends could be turned into smarter policy.
Someone once said that politics is , of course ,  " showbiz for ugly people. " 
And someone asked, " Why ?  " 
We have vast budget deficits.
So what follows from that is that if you think it ' s all about money -- you can only measure success in public services in health care and education and policing by spending more money , you can only measure progress by spending money -- you ' re going to have a pretty miserable time.
So , starting with the political philosophy.
The first is this : We believe that if you give people more power and control over their lives , if you give people more choice , if you put them in the driving seat , then actually , you can create a stronger and better society.
Now , if you combine this very simple , very conservative thought -- go with the grain of human nature -- with all the advances in behavioral economics , some of which we were just hearing about , again , I think we can achieve a real increase in well-being , in happiness , in a stronger society without necessarily having to spend a whole lot more money.
Local power , central power , now , people power.
You weren ' t in charge of policing , justice , education , health , welfare.
So this was the pre-bureaucratic age.
Suddenly , you have the big , strong , central state.
It was able to do that itself.
So we ' re now living in a post-bureaucratic age , where genuine people power is possible.
That is already happened ; the information and Internet revolution has actually gone all the way through our societies in so many different ways , but it hasn ' t , in every way , yet touched our government.
In the old days , only the government could hold the information , and only a few elected people could try and grab that information and question it and challenge it.
We have only , in government and in politics , started to scratch the surface of what people are doing in the commercial world with the information revolution.
Choice . Now you all shop online , compare online , do everything online , and yet this revolution has hardly touched the surface of public services like education , or health care or policing , and you ' re going to see this change massively.
It is a crime map . This is a crime map from Chicago.
So those three ways -- transparency , accountability and choice -- will make a huge difference.
We ' re being advised by some of these people , as was said , to try and bring all the experience to book.
How do you do it ? 
Look at what this does . This is a simple piece of behavioral economics.
We all know we need to recycle more.
Here are my two favorite U.S . speeches of the last 50 years.
And I think an even more wonderful speech , which I ' m going to read a big chunk of , which sums up what I said at the beginning about believing there is more to life than money , and more that we should try and measure than money.
It measures everything , in short , except that which makes life worthwhile. " 
biology,biotech,community,science,technology
Reading and writing DNA code is getting easier and cheaper.
So who gets to do it ? 
It ' s a movement that -- it advocates making biotechnology accessible to everyone , not just scientists and people in government labs.
So wouldn ' t it be nice if there was a place in your local neighborhood where you could go and learn about this stuff , do it hands-on ? 
None of my previous experience prepared me for what came next . Can you guess ? 
The only thing that got us through that period was that we knew that all over the world , there were other people that were trying to do the same thing that we were.
These are some of the biggest ones , and there are others opening every day.
We work in groups , in big cities — — and in small villages.
We like to build things.
And we make cells dance.
So the United Nations did just that , and they recently issued a report on this whole area , and what they concluded was the power of this technology for positive was much greater than the risk for negative , and they even looked specifically at the DIYbio community , and they noted , not surprisingly , that the press had a tendency to consistently overestimate our capabilities and underestimate our ethics.
We dispose of our waste properly , we follow safety procedures , we don ' t work with pathogens.
Now , it could happen , but I ' m not going to plan my life around it.
There were a lot of risks involved that they talked about during the informed consent portion.
Well , it wasn ' t that long ago we were asking ,  " Well , what would anyone do with a personal computer ?  " 
A biohacker in Germany , a journalist , wanted to know whose dog was leaving little presents on his street ? 
It actually is a Japanese beetle.
You can send weather balloons up into the stratosphere , collect microbes , see what ' s up there.
You can also do an art science project . Some of these are really spectacular , and they look at social , ecological problems from a completely different perspective.
The thing is , there ' s something in these labs that they have to offer society that you can ' t find anywhere else.
It ' s spaces like these that spawned personal computing.

Kent Larson : Brilliant designs to fit more people in every city
You needed easy access to the fields.
That ' s where babies were born and people died.
You had centralized energy production.
You had separated functions , increasingly.
So you have the sprawl of LA , the sprawl of Mexico City.
That means building the entire , the equivalent of the entire built infrastructure of the U.S . in 15 years.
More than half the people now in the world live in cities , and that will just continue to escalate.
Now there ' s some trends that will impact cities.
And increasingly , everything that people buy , every consumer product , in one way or another , can be personalized.
Maybe not the way people dress , but -- You know , the question now is , how can we have all the good things that we identify with cities without all the bad things ? 
So we went back and started looking at the great cities that evolved before the cars.
And if you look at the data , when you have that kind of a structure , you get a very even distribution of the shops and the physicians and the pharmacies and the cafes in Paris.
So we said , we ' ll , let ' s look at new cities , and we ' re involved in a couple of new city projects in China.
This can also be a resilient electrical microgrid , community heating , power , communication networks , etc. , can be concentrated there.
It ' s something of an Internet typology pattern , so you can have a series of these neighborhoods.
This is even a more interesting solution in Seoul , Korea.
I went back a couple of weekends ago , took this photograph of these fabulous new bike lanes that they have installed.
Mobility on demand is something we ' ve been thinking about , so we think we need an ecosystem of these shared-use vehicles connected to mass transit.
We ' ve been developing at the Media Lab this little city car that is optimized for shared use in cities.
You don ' t need reverse . You don ' t need parallel parking.
It ' s not really a problem.
You don ' t know if it ' s going to run you over.
This is an early design for this little three-wheel , it ' s an electronic bike . You have to pedal to operate it in a bike lane , but if you ' re an older person , that ' s a switch . If you ' re a healthy person , you might have to work really hard to go fast.
Mayor Menino in Boston says lack of affordable housing for young people is one of the biggest problems the city faces.
Now , the most interesting implementation of that for us is when you can begin to have robotic walls , so your space can convert from exercise to a workplace , if you run a virtual company.
I mean , architects have been thinking about these ideas for a long time . What we need to do now , develop things that can scale to those 300 million Chinese people that would like to live in the city , and very comfortably.
And so we ' ve been working on a chassis of the wall itself.
If they function as if they ' re twice as big , we can get 28 units in.
That goes down to 10,000 dollars per car , just for the cost of the parking.
Blue light is very efficient , so we have these tunable 24-bit LED lighting fixtures.
We think these little wireless sensors are more effective.
In this case , she picks up her phone , she can map food preparation at the kitchen island to a particular location of sunlight . An algorithm will keep it in that location as long as she ' s engaged in that activity.
This is Starbucks , you know.
At the Cambridge Innovation Center , you can have shared desks . I ' ve spent a lot of time in Finland at the design factory of Aalto University , where the they have a shared shop and shared Fablab , shared quiet spaces , electronics spaces , recreation places.
It ' s a global imperative . We have to get this right.

Some say bigger.
They ' re also harmless plankton-feeding animals.
They were also very important to coast communities going back hundreds of years , especially the around the Claddagh , Duff , Connemara region where subsistence farmers used to sail out on their hookers and open boats sometimes way off shore , sometimes to a place called the Sunfish Bank , which is about 30 miles west of Achill Island , to kill the basking sharks.
You get gallons of oil from their liver.
So they were incredibly important animals.
And sharks used to come into the bay.
Or at times , they would row out in their small currachs and kill it with a lance through the back of the neck.
We ' re often all frightened of sharks thanks to  " Jaws. " 
So I don ' t know what the balance is , but I think sharks have got more right to be fearful of us than we have of them.
Sharks were still killed up into the mid-80s , especially after places like Dunmore East in County Waterford.
Now I don ' t pretend to have any Irish , but in Kerry they were often known as  " Ainmhide na seolta, "  the monster with the sails.
And that ' s a lovely , evocative name.
And this represents their habit of basking on the surface when the sun is out.
And it ' s been suggested that basking sharks would make fantastic indicators of climate change , because they ' re basically continuous plankton recorders swimming around with their mouth open.
They ' re not protected in Ireland.
And we try to guess what they ' re doing from their behavior on the surface.
So what we ' ve been doing a couple of years -- but last year was a big year -- is we started tagging sharks so we could try to get some idea of sight fidelity and movements and things like that.
Go up in your boat and tag the shark.
Half the challenge is to get access , is to be in the right place at the right time.
One is to try and work out the gender of the shark.
A satellite tag only works when the air is clear of the water and can send a signal to the satellite.
What happens is that you set the tag to detach from the shark after a fixed period , in this case it was eight months , and literally to the day the tag popped off , drifted up , said hello to the satellite and sent , not all the data , but enough data for us to use.
And basically it spent all its time , the last eight months , in Irish waters.
That ' s nine and a half thousand kilometers . We never thought that happened.
And we thought that basking sharks were temperate animals and only lived in our latitude.
Now I ' m not a geneticist , so I ' m not going to pretend to understand the genetics.
So when they looked at the genetics of basking sharks , they found that the diversity was incredibly low.
And you see that this work was done in 2006.
And of course , that ' s very important if you want to know what the population size is and the status of the animals.
And it ' s thought maybe it was a bottleneck , a genetic bottleneck thought to be 12,000 years ago , and this has caused a very low diversity.
So even though basking sharks are found throughout the world , you couldn ' t tell the difference genetically from one from the Pacific , the Atlantic , New Zealand , or from Ireland , South Africa.
And I suspect most geneticists don ' t understand it either , but they produce the numbers.
8,000 animals in the world.
But the average of all these studies came out -- the mean is about 5,000 , which I personally don ' t believe , but then I am a skeptic.
In fact , of those 20,000 , 8,000 were thought to be females.
They didn ' t get enough samples to really explore the genetics in enough detail.
Another source would be fisheries bycatch.
This is a shark that was actually landed in Howth just before Christmas , illegally , because you ' re not allowed to do that under E.U . law , and was actually sold for eight euros a kilo as shark steak.
So it ' s very important work , and they can ask some really good questions , and they can tell us about population size and subpopulations and structure , but they ' re constrained by lack of samples.
And then when myself and Emmett got back to Malin Head , to the pier , I noticed some black slime on the front of the boat.
And we would use conventional methods -- I have a crossbow , you see the crossbow in my hand there , which we use to sample whales and dolphins for genetic studies as well.
So that wasn ' t going to work.
So I scraped the slime off and I sent it off to Aberdeen.
But I kept emailing , saying ,  " Have you had a chance to look at my slime yet ?  " 
And they amplified it and they tested it and they found , yes , this was actually basking shark DNA , which was got from the slime.
So we thought , okay , we ' re going to try to get out and get some slime.
And you rarely see them.
So by just rubbing the mop handle down the shark as it swam under the boat -- you see , here ' s a shark that ' s running under the boat here -- we managed to collect slime.
I ' ve been working on whales and dolphins in Ireland for 20 years now , and they ' re kind of a bit more dramatic.
But hey , sometimes these things are sent to you and you just have to take them when they come.
And what you ' re trying to look at is the males have claspers , which kind of dangle out behind the back of the shark.
And being able to tell the gender of a shark has got very important for things like policing the trade in basking shark and other species through societies , because it is illegal to trade any sharks.
They ' re often quite brief . They ' re often very seasonally constrained.
I ' ll take that as my scientific legacy.
If you ' re more interested , we have a basking shark website now just set up.
children,crime,culture,education,evil,global issues,heroism,peace,prison,psychology,war
Interestingly , I asked this question when I was a little kid.
Some got killed , and some did it without drug assistance.
Good people could be seduced across that line , and under good and some rare circumstances , bad kids could recover with help , with reform , with rehabilitation.
And that tells us several things.
It also means  " the morning star, "  in some scripture.
Paradoxically , it was God who created hell as a place to store evil.
And that ' s the key : it ' s about power.
And these were men and women who were putting prisoners through unbelievable humiliation.
 " Don ' t blame us . It ' s not the system . It ' s the few bad apples , the few rogue soldiers. " 
I became an expert witness for one of the guards , Sergeant Chip Frederick , and in that position , I had access to the dozen investigative reports.
All of them come from the cameras of American soldiers.
They are not soldiers prepared for this mission at all.
Interrogators from Titan Corporation , all there , and they ' re getting no information about the insurgency.
That ' s one of the visual illustrations of evil.
What was he doing in that prison rather than in some mental institution ? 
You have to reframe it and ask ,  " What is responsible ?  " 
We look at what ' s inside of the person , the bad apples.
Is there a stage director ?  " 
The system creates the situation that corrupts the individuals , and the system is the legal , political , economic , cultural background.
So the Lucifer effect involves understanding human character transformations with these three factors.
And what is the system that creates and maintains that situation ? 
And the good news story that I ' m going to hopefully come to at the end is that it makes some of us heroes.
This is Stanley Milgram , little Jewish kid from the Bronx , and he asked the question ,  " Could the Holocaust happen here , now ?  " 
500 New Haven , Connecticut , 500 Bridgeport.
And it said ,  " We don ' t want college students.
So , you go down , and one of you is going to be a learner , and one of you is going to be a teacher.
And one of you is told by the authority , the guy in the lab coat ,  " Your job as teacher is to give this guy material to learn.
That ' s the key . All evil starts with 15 volts.
You ' re a good person . You complain.
And the question is , who would go all the way to 450 volts ? 
They said only one percent . Because that ' s sadistic behavior , and we know , psychiatry knows , only one percent of Americans are sadistic.
In study 16 , where you see somebody like you go all the way , 90 percent go all the way . In study five , if you see people rebel , 90 percent rebel.
A dial in a sense that you can make almost everybody totally obedient , down to the majority , down to none.
He persuaded them to commit mass suicide.
Interestingly , Stanley Milgram and I were in the same high school class in James Monroe in the Bronx , 1954.
We did interviews . Picked two dozen : the most normal , the most healthy.
And secondly , we know there ' s no difference between the boys who are going to be guards and the boys who are going to be prisoners.
So they , right there , you know , they took me out the door , they put my hands against the car.
They took me to the police station , the basement of the police station . Then they put me in a cell.
They were taking this experiment too seriously.
Guards get prisoners to clean the toilet bowls out with their bare hands , to do other humiliating tasks.
My guards did it in five days . The stress reaction was so extreme that normal kids we picked because they were healthy had breakdowns within 36 hours.
Does it make a difference if they ' re anonymous , in how they treat their victims ? 
In many , soldiers are anonymous in uniform.
If they don ' t change their appearance , only one of eight kills , tortures or mutilates.
So what are the seven social processes that grease the slippery slope of evil ? 
Uncritical conformity to group norms.
Your personality and morality are disengaged.
You don ' t need it . You just need the social-psychological processes.
And he goes on to say ,  " The landmark Stanford study provides a cautionary tale for all military operations. " 
The answer is nobody , and , I think , nobody on purpose.
The shift is toward a public health model that recognizes situational and systemic vectors of disease.
That means that line is not out there.
We want kids to think , I ' m the hero in waiting , waiting for the right situation to come along , and I will act heroically.
Our traditional societal heroes are wrong , because they are the exceptions.
We want our kids to realize most heroes are everyday people , and the heroic act is unusual . This is Joe Darby.
For three years , they were in hiding.
She came down , saw that madhouse and said ,  " You know what , it ' s terrible what you ' re doing to those boys.
I just came to my senses , obviously.
And you have to say ,  " Mama , humanity is my business. " 
The key to heroism is two things.
Fifty-year-old African-American construction worker.
You know what ?  They freeze.
Wesley and the guy -- 20 and a half inches height.
And the moral imperative is  " I did what everyone should do. " 
You ' re going to cheat , or you ' re going to allow bullying.
Because it may only happen once in your life , and when you pass it by , you ' ll always know , I could have been a hero and I let it pass me by.
Advocate for respect of personal dignity , for justice and peace , which sadly our administration has not been doing.
brain,consciousness,neuroscience,science,self
The wonder is about the fact that we all woke up this morning and we had with it the amazing return of our conscious mind.
We would have no access to love or to the ability to create.
This is a mystery that has really been extremely hard to elucidate.
It would be ridiculous to claim that we know how we make consciousness in our brains , but we certainly can begin to approach the question , and we can begin to see the shape of a solution.
This is not a person that is being studied at autopsy.
But at any rate , they are there.
And we could take a very simple view and say , well , it is that which we lose when we fall into deep sleep without dreams , or when we go under anesthesia , and it is what we regain when we recover from sleep or from anesthesia.
That flow of mental images is mind.
We have a Me that is automatically present in our minds right now.
So a conscious mind is a mind with a self in it.
And it ' s quite clear that , in order to make minds , we need to construct neural maps.
This , of course , is a visual map that I ' m showing you , but this applies to any kind of map -- auditory , for example , in relation to sound frequencies , or to the maps that we construct with our skin in relation to an object that we palpate.
But sometime ago , I discovered that if I cover my left eye , instead what I get is this.
If I scan my retina through the horizontal plane that you see there in the little corner , what I get is the following.
And it corresponds to a little cyst that is located below.
So from the retina you go onto visual cortex.
And something else that happens is that those image-making regions where you have the plotting of all these neural maps , can then provide signals to this ocean of purple that you see around , which is the association cortex , where you can make records of what went on in those islands of image-making.
And those are exactly the same that are going to be used for image-making when we recall information.
And for a long time , people did not even want to touch it , because they ' d say ,  " How can you have this reference point , this stability , that is required to maintain the continuity of selves day after day ?  " 
So let me tell you just a little bit about how I came to this.
And so that is a beginning.
If you deviate too much in the parameters that are close to the midline of that life-permitting survival range , you go into disease or death.
So that ' s one more element for this continuity.
So here ' s how it looks . Look at the region there.
What happens then actually is that you lose the grounding of the self , you have no longer access to any feeling of your own existence , and , in fact , there can be images going on , being formed in the cerebral cortex , except you don ' t know they ' re there.
So in that green component of the brain stem , if you damage it , and often it happens , what you get is complete paralysis , but your conscious mind is maintained.
There was a very interesting film , one of the rare good films done about a situation like this , by Julian Schnabel some years ago about a patient that was in that condition.
They are exquisitely topographic and they are exquisitely interconnected in a recursive pattern.
And you have the cerebral cortex providing the great spectacle of our minds with the profusion of images that are , in fact , the contents of our minds and that we normally pay most attention to , as we should , because that ' s really the film that is rolling in our minds.
You cannot have a conscious mind if you don ' t have the interaction between cerebral cortex and brain stem.
Except that they ' re not as rich as ours , because they don ' t have a cerebral cortex like we do.
Now there are three levels of self to consider -- the proto , the core and the autobiographical.
And everybody ' s dogs at home have an autobiographical self to a certain degree.
And out of that came the instruments of culture -- religions , justice , trade , the arts , science , technology.
And this is , of course , the culture where we have developed something that I like to call socio-cultural regulation.
Primates are extremely curious -- and humans most of all.
And finally , medicine.
So that ' s a very good reason beyond curiosity to justify what we ' re doing , and to justify having some interest in what is going on in our brains.
blog,culture,feminism,history,women,writing
I was raised on  " Free to be you and me "  -- hip-hop -- not as many woohoos for hip-hop in the house.
We actually just got  " middle class "  in Colorado Springs , Colorado , but you get the picture.
Feminism was the water I grew up in.
But she was not the only feminist in the house.
In any case , I didn ' t readily claim the feminist label , even though it was all around me , because I associated it with my mom ' s women ' s groups , her swishy skirts and her shoulder pads -- none of which had much cachet in the hallways of Palmer High School where I was trying to be cool at the time.
So what very profound epiphany , you might ask , was responsible for my feminist click moment ? 
I decided , okay , I can claim the feminist label.
So my feminism is very indebted to my mom ' s , but it looks very different.
Pay equity ?  Yes . Absolutely a feminist issue.
I co-edit , along with a collective of other super-smart , amazing women , a site called Feministing.com.
Feministing has been able to get merchandise pulled off the shelves of Walmart.
So we ' re able to pull in the next generation in a totally new way.
We don ' t want one icon.
Many in my generation -- because of well-intentioned parenting and self-esteem education -- were socialized to believe that we were special little snowflakes -- who were going to go out and save the world.
And there ' s a lot to be overwhelmed about , to be fair -- an environmental crisis , wealth disparity in this country unlike we ' ve seen since 1928 , and globally , a totally immoral and ongoing wealth disparity.
I was fired up ; I was ready to make a difference.
My mom took a drink of her signature Sea Breeze , her eyes really welled with tears , and she looked right at me and she said ,  " I will not stand for your desperation. " 
There ' s a writer I ' ve been deeply influenced by , Parker Palmer , and he writes that many of us are often whiplashed  " between arrogant overestimation of ourselves and a servile underestimation of ourselves. " 
I wrote a book about eight incredible people all over this country doing social justice work.
So she made a film about the welfare system and had a huge impact.
Many of them are working in deeply intractable systems -- the military , congress , the education system , etc.
But how good a failure is it ?  " 
But on the other , we root our self-esteem in the daily acts of trying to make one person ' s day more kind , more just , etc.
She was talking about board meetings , she was founding peace organizations , she was coordinating carpools , she was consoling friends -- all these daily acts of care and creativity.
My mom and so many women like her have taught me that life is not about glory , or certainty , or security even.
And at the end of the day , these things make for a lifetime of challenge and reward.
1338
But the truth is it doesn ' t really matter which sage said it first , because it ' s still sage advice , even today.
I ' ve always been fascinated with knowing the self.
I take it from this little dictum ,  " Know thyself. " 
Under the deluge of minute-to-minute text conversations , emails , relentless exchange of media channels and passwords and apps and reminders and Tweets and tags , we lose sight of what all this fuss is supposed to be about in the first place : ourselves.
And we feel like we have to get far , far away to a secluded retreat , leaving it all behind.
Think of the term we use ,  " Retreat. " 
And the problem with escaping your day-to-day life is that you have to come home eventually.
Can we redefine our relationship with the technologized world in order to have the heightened sense of self-awareness that we seek ? 
It ' s called thought-controlled computing.
Let me show you what it looks like.
You ' re actually looking inside my head as I speak.
Or what if I can take that information and put it into an organic shape up on the screen ? 
And the more focused my brain is , the more the circuit board is going to surge with energy.
This new awareness opens up vast possibilities for applications that help improve our lives and ourselves.
My team at InteraXon and I have been developing throught-controlled application for almost a decade now.
We brought to life a vast array of prototypes and products that you could control with your mind , like thought-controlled home appliances or slot car games or video games or a levitating chair.
Over 17 days at the Olympics 7,000 visitors from all over the world actually got to individually control the light from the C.N . Tower , parliament and Niagara in real time with their minds from across the country , 3,000 km away.
And that was responsiveness.
They followed these little shifts in your mental activity.
We then realized that if technology could know something about you and use it to help you , there ' s an even more valuable application than that.
Here ' s an application that I created for the iPad.
In that headset you have fabric sensors on your forehead and above the ear.
The more you focus , the faster the rotation.
You have graphs and charts that tell you how your brain was doing -- not just how much rope you used or what your high score is , but what was going on inside of your mind.
This technology is intra-active.
It ' s how we understand the world inside and reflect it outside into this tight loop.
So you can imagine kids playing video games with their brain waves and improving their ADD symptoms as they do it.
We can peer inside our heads and interact with what was once locked away from us , what once mystified and separated us.
It would be like plugging into your own personal Google.
Humanizing technology is about taking what ' s already natural about the human-tech experience and building technology seamlessly in tandem with it.
Do you know what causes fatigue in you or what brings out your energetic self , what triggers cause you to be depressed or what fun things are going to bring you out of that funk ? 
What thought-controlled computing can allow you to do is build colorful layered pictures of our lives.
Two millennia ago , those Greeks had some powerful insights.
My mom ' s an artist , and as a child I ' d often see her bring things to life with the stroke of a brush.
I learned that our own inner worlds -- our ideas , emotions and imaginations -- were , in fact , not bound by our brains and bodies.
http://www.ted.com/talks/caroline_casey_looking_past_limits.html
Caroline Casey : Looking past limits
I wanted to race cars , and I wanted to be a cowgirl , and I wanted to be Mowgli from  " The Jungle Book. " 
And on my seventeenth birthday , I accompanied my little sister in complete innocence , as I always had all my life -- my visually impaired sister -- to go to see an eye specialist.
And on my seventeenth birthday , after my fake eye exam , the eye specialist just noticed it happened to be my birthday.
And he turned to my mother , and he said ,  " You haven ' t told her yet ?  " 
Well , if anybody says country music isn ' t powerful , let me tell you this : I got there because my father ' s passion for Johnny Cash and a song ,  " A Boy Named Sue. " 
So let me just tell you , the great part of all of this ? 
Hey.
And every woman , you are so beautiful.
No labels.
So just like Johnny Cash ' s Sue , a boy given a girl ' s name , I would grow up and learn from experience how to be tough and how to survive , when they were no longer there to protect me , or just take it all away.
But very quickly I recovered . It was like that.
And with the same dogged determination that my father had bred into me since I was such a child -- he taught me how to sail , knowing I could never see where I was going , I could never see the shore , and I couldn ' t see the sails , and I couldn ' t see the destination.
And I believed I could do it.
And then I was a masseuse . And then I was a landscape gardener.
And they didn ' t even know.
And temporarily , very unexpectedly , they dropped.
I was 28 years old.
Asking for help can be incredibly difficult.
But all that belief had fueled me so long.
And please , any designers out there ? 
But can I just tell you , the little sign for a gents '  toilet or a ladies '  toilet is determined by a triangle.
And so after admitting I couldn ' t see to HR , they sent me off to an eye specialist.
And that eye specialist , he didn ' t bother testing my eyes.
And do you love what you do , Caroline ?  " 
And he said ,  " Do you love it ?  " 
Now listen , I wasn ' t going to say to him ,  " Well , I wanted to race cars and motorbikes. " 
I think it ' s time to stop fighting and do something different. " 
And I had no idea where I was going . I had no idea.
And I went on a run that I know so well.
And there was a rock that I always missed.
And I was floored , and I was broken , and I was angry.
What am I going to be ?  " 
I had lost my belief.
And then I remember thinking about that eye specialist asking me ,  " What do you want to be ?  What do you want to be ? 
And really slowly , slowly , slowly , it happened.
You don ' t get more different than that. " 
But you can ' t tell me , no , I can ' t be Mowgli , because guess what ? 
And I sprinted home , and I didn ' t fall , and I didn ' t crash.
I ' m going to go across India on the back of an elephant.
I had no idea how . I had no idea how you hire an elephant , get an elephant.
Nine months later , after that day on snot rock , I had the only blind date in my life with a seven and a half foot elephant called Kanchi.
Because I wasn ' t believing in me , really me , all the bits of me -- all the bits of all of us.
Six thousand people got to see because of that.
And I set up Kanchi , because my organization was always going to be named after my elephant , because disability is like the elephant in the room.
That ' s what I wanted to do.
And I speak , but this is an amazing audience , and what am I doing here ? 
Even though I present confident , I was scared.
And I have learned , you know what , cars and motorbikes and elephants , that ' s not freedom.
And if you truly believe -- and I mean believe from the bottom of your heart -- you can make change happen.
And stop with the labels , the limiting.
In James Howard Kunstler ' s view , public spaces should be inspired centers of civic life and the physical manifestation of the common good . Instead , he argues , what we have in America is a nation of places not worth caring about.
The immersive ugliness of our everyday environments in America is entropy made visible.
Nobody ' s having a better day down here because of that.
I think it ' s appropriate to call it the greatest misallocation of resources in the history of the world.
We ' re going to talk about that some more.
The public realm comes mostly in the form of the street in America because we don ' t have the 1,000-year-old cathedral plazas and market squares of older cultures.
The public realm has to inform us not only where we are geographically , but it has to inform us where we are in our culture.
You know , this happens to be the asteroid belt of architectural garbage two miles north of my town.
That ' s nature ' s way of telling you that you ' re doing a poor job of defining space.
When we have enough of them , we ' re going to have a nation that ' s not worth defending.
Public space . This is a good public space.
That ' s a fancy way of saying it ' s got shops , bars , bistros , destinations -- things go in and out of it . It ' s permeable.
You know , you don ' t have to have a Kwanzaa festival.
A public place so dismal that the winos don ' t even want to go there.
This was the winner of an international design award in , I think , 1966 , something like that.
This , in fact , would be a better building if we put mosaic portraits of Josef Stalin , Pol Pot , Saddam Hussein , and all the other great despots of the 20th century on the side of the building , because then we ' d honestly be saying what the building is really communicating to us.
Because this was perceived to be a weather problem.
You can see exactly what went on , three o ' clock in the morning at the design meeting.
It was :  " Fuck it. " 
It ' s not civically rich enough for them to go down there.
Other activities are allowed to occur upstairs , you know , apartments , offices , and so on.
It ' s really incredible.
Of course , they ' ll never be there , as long as this is in that condition.
And in fact , the remedy for wounded and mutilated urbanism is good urbanism , good buildings.
The street trees have really four jobs to do and that ' s it : To spatially denote the pedestrian realm , to protect the pedestrians from the vehicles in the carriageway , to filter the sunlight onto the sidewalk , and to soften the hardscape of the buildings and to create a ceiling -- a vaulted ceiling -- over the street , at its best.
They ' re not the same thing.
And so what you see fairly early , in the mid-19th century , is this idea that we now have to have an antidote to the industrial city , which is going to be life in the country for everybody.
It becomes a cartoon of a country house , in a cartoon of the country.
Basically , a house with nothing on the side because this house wants to state , emphatically ,  " I ' m a little cabin in the woods . There ' s nothing on either side of me.
Unless the people that live here are Munchkins , nobody ' s going to be using that.
But we know what ' s going on in these houses , you know.
So they take the first one that comes along , often.
You know , but there ' s obviously a notion that if you let the inmates of this thing out , that they would snatch a motorist off the street and eat his liver.
We are entering an epochal period of change in the world , and -- certainly in America -- the period that will be characterized by the end of the cheap oil era.
We ' re going to have to do something else instead.
We ' re going have to grow more food closer to where we live.
And we should have started two days before yesterday.
So that , you know , the residences make sense deployed in relation to the places of business , of culture and of governance.
Well , in point of fact , most of them are not going to make it.
And if we ' re lucky , the result will be revivified town centers and neighborhood centers in our existing towns and cities.
We ' re not going to be rescued by the hyper-car ; we ' re not going to be rescued by alternative fuels.
We are sleepwalking into the future.
Be prepared to be good neighbors.
Consumers are different than citizens.
So thank you very much.

It all started with a crazy idea in November of 2004.
And I handed out these postcards randomly on the streets of Washington , D.C. , not knowing what to expect.
Soon my crazy idea didn ' t seem so crazy.
What I ' d like to do now is share with you a very special handful of secrets from that collection , starting with this one.
They can be shocking or silly or soulful.
This one does a great job of demonstrating the creativity that people have when they make and mail me a postcard.
Secrets can remind us of the countless human dramas , of frailty and heroism , playing out silently in the lives of people all around us even now.
I love to speak on college campuses and share secrets and the stories with students.
 " Your mic wasn ' t off during sound check.
 " Inside this envelope is the ripped up remains of a suicide note I didn ' t use.
It ' s in my pocket right now. " 
And he said ,  " Frank , I ' ve got to share with you this story that just played out in my life. " 
He says ,  " It ' s really brought us closer together through the years.
He said ,  " But this time it seemed like it was taking her forever to get through each one. " 
And she turned to him and said ,  " Is that our cat ?  " 
And he emailed me this picture.
Matty was inspired by that secret to start his own website , a website called IFoundYourCamera.
This one ' s my favorite.
 " That ' s me , my husband and son.
My son ' s birth is on this camera.
 " When people I love leave voicemails on my phone I always save them in case they die tomorrow and I have no other way of hearing their voice ever again. " 
Secrets can take many forms.
Grandma : ♫ It ' s somebody ' s birthday today ♫ ♫ Somebody ' s birthday today ♫ ♫ The candles are lighted ♫ ♫ on somebody ' s cake ♫ ♫ And we ' re all invited ♫ ♫ for somebody ' s sake ♫ You ' re 21 years old today.
June Cohen : Frank , that was beautiful , so touching.
I think in some ways , the reason I started the project , even though I didn ' t know it at the time , was because I was struggling with my own secrets.
FW : Sometimes I share that information , yeah.

[The Himalayas.] The flat horizon that we ' ve evolved with has been a metaphor for the infinite : unbounded resources and unlimited capacity for disposal of waste.
What we see here are satellites around the Earth and the Earth in proper registration against the universe , as we see.
I ' ve had 12 students work on this for their graduate work , and the result has been this software called Uniview and a company called SCISS in Sweden.
As we move out , the light from these distant galaxies have taken so long , we ' re essentially backing up into the past.
If we were outside this , it would almost be meaningless , in the sense as before time.
What you ' re going to see -- we ' re going to have to jump in here pretty quickly between several orders of magnitude to get down to where we see the solar system -- these are the paths of Voyager 1 , Voyager 2 , Pioneer 11 and Pioneer 10 , the first four spacecraft to have left the solar system.
for the Cassini mission.
We have a growing user base of this , and we network domes.
This is an image from Saturday , photographed by the Aqua satellite , but through the Uniview software.
But we can see the haze from fires and so forth in the Ganges valley down below in India.
We carry that in us.

Tinkering School is a place where kids can pick up sticks and hammers and other dangerous objects , and be trusted.
When the kids arrive they ' re confronted with lots of stuff : wood and nails and rope and wheels , and lots of tools , real tools.
Nothing ever turns out as planned .. . ever.
And sometimes we just start building.
Problems become puzzles and obstacles disappear.
All materials are available for use.
Gever Tulley : A rollercoaster built by seven-year-olds.
Tod Machover of MIT ' s Media Lab is devoted to extending musical expression to everyone , from virtuosos to amateurs , and in the most diverse forms , from opera to video games . He and composer Dan Ellsey shed light on what ' s next.
The first idea I ' d like to suggest is that we all love music a great deal . It means a lot to us.
So , you can ' t just listen to music , you have to make it somehow.
And we started by making instruments for some of the world ' s greatest performers -- we call these hyperinstruments -- for Yo-Yo Ma , Peter Gabriel , Prince , orchestras , rock bands . Instruments where they ' re all kinds of sensors built right into the instrument , so the instrument knows how it ' s being played.
One of the largest collections is called the Brain Opera.
We toured that for a long time . It is now permanently in Vienna , where we built a museum around it.
And music is very fun , but it ' s also transformative.
We are very involved in education . We have a long-term project called Toy Symphony , where we make all kinds of instruments that are also addictive , but for little kids , so the kids will fall in love with making music , want to spend their time doing it , and then will demand to know how it works , how to make more , how to create . So , we make squeezy instruments , like these Music Shapers that measure the electricity in your fingers , Beatbugs that let you tap in rhythms -- they gather your rhythm , and like hot potato , you send your rhythm to your friends , who then have to imitate or respond to what your doing -- and a software package called Hyperscore , which lets anybody use lines and color to make quite sophisticated music . Extremely easy to use , but once you use it , you can go quite deep -- music in any style . And then , by pressing a button , it turns into music notation so that live musicians can play your pieces.
A lot of you have probably seen Oliver Sacks '  wonderful new book called  " Musicophilia "  . It ' s on sale in the bookstore . It ' s a great book.
Music is the best way to restore speech to people who have lost it through strokes , movement to people with Parkinson ' s disease.
One of them is right near Boston , called Tewksbury Hospital.
I wanted to show you a quick video of some of this work before I go on.
So Hyperscore lets you start from scratch very quickly.
I think that ' s true for many of us , and I want to give you two examples of how music is one of the most powerful interfaces we have , from ourselves to the outside world.
So this guy wants to live forever , he downloads himself into his environment.
So , as you can see in this prototype , gigantic piano strings , each string is controlled with a little robotic element -- either little bows that stroke the strings , propellers that tickle the strings , acoustic signals that vibrate the strings . We also have an army of robots on stage.
And then they can also , when you snap , line up exactly the way you ' d like to.
This is how he ' s chosen to represent himself.
This premieres in Monaco -- it ' s in September 2009 . If by any chance you can ' t make it , another idea with this project -- here ' s this guy building his legacy through this very unusual form , through music and through the environment.
Everything I ' ve shown you so far -- whether it ' s a hyper-cello for Yo-Yo Ma or squeezy toy for a child -- the instruments stayed the same and are valuable for a certain class of person : a virtuoso , a child.
So , can you give a hand to Adam Boulanger , Ph.D . student from the MIT Media Lab , and Dan Ellsey . Dan , thanks to TED and to Bombardier Flexjet , Dan is here with us today all the way from Tewksbury . He ' s a resident at Tewksbury Hospital.
I have always loved music and I am excited to be able to conduct my own music with this new software.
So , turned out he ' s a fantastic composer , and over the last few years has been a constant collaborator of ours . He has made many , many pieces.
So , you want to say a little bit about how you guys work ? 
We went with the type of gesture metaphor that Dan was already used to with his speaking controller.
You know , what ' s his metaphor for performance ? 
But what about expression ?  What about that moment when an artist delivers that piece of work ?  You know , do our technologies allow us to express ? 
DE : This is  " My Eagle Song. " 
He ' s incredibly fast at it , too , faster than I am , in fact.
Each one gets a color . He goes back into the composition window , draws the lines , places everything the way he wants to . Looking at the Hyperscore , you can see it also , you can see where the sections are , something might continue for a while , change , get really crazy and then end up with a big bang at the end.
We asked one of our students to look at what the camera is measuring.
So , are we ready Adam ?

Terry Moore : Why is  ' x '  the unknown ? 
Where ' d that come from ? 
This includes the little system in Arabic called al-jebra.
The Arabic texts containing this mathematical wisdom finally made their way to Europe -- which is to say Spain -- in the 11th and 12th centuries.
Trust me on that one.
It ' s also the very first letter of the word shalan , which means  " something "  just like the the English word  " something "  -- some undefined , unknown thing.
The problem for the Medieval Spanish scholars who were tasked with translating this material is that the letter SHeen and the word shalan can ' t be rendered into Spanish because Spanish doesn ' t have that SH , that  " sh "  sound.
But now we have the answer to our question.
http://www.ted.com/talks/daniel_goldstein_the_battle_between_your_present_and_future_self.html
Daniel Goldstein : The battle between your present and future self
And these women sing an enchanting song , a song so alluring that all sailors who hear it crash into the rocks and die. " 
And I ' d like to think if this was the case , they probably would have rehearsed it a few times.
All right , so tie me to the mast. " 
And the first mate wisely resists and doesn ' t untie Odysseus.
He ' s like ,  " Is this still the rehearsal , or should I untie him ?  " 
If you do that tomorrow , I ' ll be dead , you ' ll be dead , every single one of the men will be dead.
Hilarity ensues.
Scholars have long invoked this metaphor of two selves when it comes to questions of temptation.
He just thinks about the here and now and the immediate gratification.
Well resisting temptation is hard , as the 19th century English economist Nassau William Senior said ,  " To abstain from the enjoyment which is in our power , or to seek distant rather than immediate results , are among the most painful exertions of the human will. " 
But resisting temptation is hard.
It has these strong , heroic arms that can lift doughnuts into your mouth.
There ' s nobody to stick up for the future self.
Tying yourself to the mast is the oldest one , but there are other ones such as locking a credit card away with a key or not bringing junk food into the house so you won ' t eat it or unplugging your Internet connection so you can use your computer.
And when you try to execute these commitment devices , you realize the devil is really in the details.
But then I thought , oh , I ' m sending myself mixed messages.
But then I was like , that ' s more bad than writing is good , and so that wouldn ' t work.
Such it is with commitment devices.
And then when you ' re ever in a situation where you don ' t have a commitment device in place -- like ,  " Oh my God , that person ' s offering me a doughnut , and I have no defense mechanism, "  -- you just eat it.
The other problem with commitment devices is that you can always weasel your way out of them.
You ' re putting yourself , you ' re binding yourself , and you ' re weaseling your way out of it , and then you ' re beating yourself up afterwards.
I ' m talking about the topic of saving.
Whereas the future self wants the present self to save.
And we ' re at a situation now where for every three baby boomers , the McKinsey Global Institute predicts that two will not be able to meet their pre-retirement needs while they ' re in retirement.
That is to say , we somehow might not believe that we ' re going to get old , or we might not be able to imagine that we ' re going to get old some day.
So my coauthors and I have used computers , the greatest tool of our time , to assist people ' s imagination and help them imagine what it might be like to go into the future.
Each outcome is shown by one of these markers , and each sits on a row that represents a level of wealth and retirement.
Now you can try to move your outcomes around.
It simulates what it is like to invest in something and to watch that investment pan out.
If you ' re like most people , just seeing that gave you a small sense of elation and joy -- just to think about making 50 percent more money in retirement than before.
This is a simulation that uses graphics , but other people find motivating what money can buy , not just numbers.
And as you get to the very bottom , you ' re faced with the unfortunate reality that if you don ' t save anything for retirement , you won ' t be able to afford any housing at all.
So what we do is we take pictures of people -- in this case , college-age people -- and we use software to age them and show these people what they ' ll look like when they ' re 60 , 70 , 80 years old.
He ' s given a control that allows him to adjust his savings rate.
If he saves the maximum legal amount , his retirement income goes up , but he ' s unhappy because now he has less money on the left-hand side to spend today.
Whereas if the present self saves a lot , the future self is delighted , where the income is close up near 100 percent.
The younger face gets happier and happier , saving nothing.
The younger face is getting unhappy.
It ' s not telling you which way to put the slider , it ' s just reminding you that you are connected to and legally tied to this future self.
There are programs you can get to see how people might look if they smoke , if they get too much exposure to the sun , if they gain weight and so on.
You might recognize him from the previous demos.
On behalf of Hal and myself , I wish all the best to your present and future selves.

Rahul is offered a cardiac procedure , but Rajiv is sent home.
Even in the best-resourced countries in the world , this life expectancy gap is as much as 20 years.
But beyond the impact of a health condition on life expectancy , we ' re also concerned about the quality of life lived.
Depression , for example , is the third-leading cause of disability , alongside conditions such as diarrhea and pneumonia in children.
Now some of you here look a bit astonished by that number , but consider for a moment the incredible diversity of mental illnesses , from autism and intellectual disability in childhood , through to depression and anxiety , substance misuse and psychosis in adulthood , all the way through to dementia in old age , and I ' m pretty sure that each and every one us present here today can think of at least one person , at least one person , who ' s affected by mental illness in our most intimate social networks.
In the sorts of countries I work in , that so-called treatment gap approaches an astonishing 90 percent.
And an especially important challenge that I ' ve had to face is the great shortage of mental health professionals , such as psychiatrists and psychologists , particularly in the developing world.
Soon after my training , I found myself working first in Zimbabwe and then in India , and I was confronted by an altogether new reality.
To give you a perspective , if I had to translate the proportion of psychiatrists in the population that one might see in Britain to India , one might expect roughly 150,000 psychiatrists in India.
I had to think out of the box about some other model of care.
Well today , I ' m very pleased to report to you that there have been many experiments in task shifting in mental health care across the developing world over the past decade , and I want to share with you the findings of three particular such experiments , all three of which focused on depression , the most common of all mental illnesses.
Now , if I had to draw together all these different experiments in task shifting , and there have of course been many other examples , and try and identify what are the key lessons we can learn that makes for a successful task shifting operation , I have coined this particular acronym , SUNDAR.
We need to unpack complex health care interventions into smaller components that can be more easily transferred to less-trained individuals.
Well , in part , because health care in the developed world , the health care costs in the [developed] world , are rapidly spiraling out of control , and a huge chunk of those costs are human resource costs.
Just over 30 years ago , the nations of the world assembled at Alma-Ata and made this iconic declaration.
It is for this reason that , some years ago , the Movement for Global Mental Health was founded as a sort of a virtual platform upon which professionals like myself and people affected by mental illness could stand together , shoulder-to-shoulder , and advocate for the rights of people with mental illness to receive the care that we know can transform their lives , and to live a life with dignity.

The bad news is that mother nature ' s back office isn ' t working yet , so those invoices don ' t get issued.
And their basic inspiration was a stern review of Lord Stern.
But it ' s not that straightforward.
We began the project with an interim report , which quickly pulled together a lot of information that had been collected on the subject by many , many researchers.
So this was comparable in size to that kind of loss.
It ' s a massive store of carbon , it ' s an amazing store of biodiversity , but what people don ' t really know is this also is a rain factory.
But the question arises : Okay , so how much do Uruguay , Paraguay , Argentina and indeed the state of Mato Grosso in Brazil pay for that vital input to that economy to the state of Amazonas , which produces that rainfall ? 
Economics has become the currency of policy.
So rainfall cycle and water regulation by rainforests at an ecosystem level.
But when did a bee actually ever give you an invoice ? 
That genetic material probably belonged , if it could belong to anyone , to a local community of poor people who parted with the knowledge that helped the researchers to find the molecule , which then became the medicine.
Something like a billion people depend on fish , the quantity of fish in the oceans.
We did estimates in our study that for countries like Brazil , India and Indonesia , even though ecosystem services -- these benefits that flow from nature to humanity for free -- they ' re not very big in percentage terms of GDP -- two , four , eight , 10 , 15 percent -- but in these countries , if we measure how much they ' re worth to the poor , the answers are more like 45 percent , 75 percent , 90 percent.
How bad can things get ? 
If you start green , it ' s like 80 to 100 percent.
And just watch the change in colors in India , China , Europe , sub-Saharan Africa as we move on and consume global biomass at a rate which is actually not going to be able to sustain us.
This is the challenge.
But of course , if you look at exactly what those profits are , almost 8,000 of those dollars are , in fact , subsidies.
Once salt deposition and chemical deposition has had its effects , that answer is more like $12,000 of cost.
So is this just a story from South Thailand ? 
In other words , what are the costs of doing business as usual ? 
If you drill water to make coke near a village farm , that ' s not illegal , but yes , it costs the community.
When we measure GDP as a measure of economic performance at the national level , we don ' t include our biggest asset at the country level.
I began a project way back called the Green Accounting Project.
So we decided to do a massive set of calculations and started producing green accounts for India and its states.
But calculating this at the next level , that means at the business sector level , is important.
Just a year later the Yangtze flooded , causing something like 5,500 deaths.
A retrospective on 40 years shows that if we had accounted for these costs -- the cost of loss of topsoil , the cost of loss of waterways , the lost productivity , the loss to local communities as a result of all these factors , desertification and so on -- those costs are almost twice as much as the market price of timber.
Someone once asked me ,  " Who is better or worse , is it Unilever or is it P&G when it comes to their impact on rainforests in Indonesia ?  " 
He ' s basically worked the cost to PUMA.
That ' s an example , I think , for us to look at and for us to draw comfort from.
And I ' m delighted that the Institute of Chartered Accountants in the U.K.
TEEB has more than a dozen separate groups of solutions including protected area evaluation and payments for ecosystem services and eco-certification and you name it , but these are the favorites.
The European Union ETS is the main marketplace.
But what we ' re missing is also some other emissions like black carbon , that is soot.
More of that in a minute.
And already Norway has contributed a billion dollars each towards Indonesia and Brazil to implement this Red Plus scheme.
Well I ' m afraid not.
So that ' s almost an eighth of society.
Well what I will say to you in parting is that we may have done that.
http://www.ted.com/talks/leonard_susskind_my_friend_richard_feynman.html
Leonard Susskind : My friend Richard Feynman
I ' m sure there are other people here who could tell you about the Richard Feynman they knew , and it would probably be a different Richard Feynman.
He was an actor . You saw him act.
Richard Feynman was also a showman , an enormous showman.
But the man had somehow a lot of room at the bottom.
It was always fun to be with him.
He made me feel smart . He made me feel he was smart.
He loved to win.
They took him -- I think it was for his birthday -- they took him for lunch.
You could get a Marilyn Monroe sandwich.
Feynman loved this story.
The only difference is a Susskind sandwich would have a lot more ham, "  ham , as in bad actor.
I remember sometime during the  ' 80s , the mid- ' 80s , Dick and I and Sidney Coleman would meet a couple of times up in San Francisco at some very rich guy ' s house -- up in San Francisco for dinner.
And they were full of all kinds of jargon.
Well , what do you talk about when you talk about minds ? 
But the trouble with the philosophers is that they were philosophizing when they should have been science-iphizing.
It was brutal ; it was funny -- ooh , it was funny.
He wasn ' t feeling too well , so he left a little bit early.
They had met the great man ; they had been instructed by the great man ; they had an enormous amount of fun having their faces shoved in the mud , and it was something special.
I think it may have been a special rapport that he and I had.
And Dick became convinced at some point that he and I had some kind of similarity of personality.
And he was curious.
We were in La Zouche.
And he said ,  " Leonardo , were you closer to your mother or to you father when you were a kid ?  " 
He taught me all sorts of things about mechanical things.
He went off like a light bulb.
He said that he had been absolutely convinced that this was necessary -- the necessary part of the growing up of a young physicist.
He went out and did an experiment.
But he was very excited that he had finally met somebody who had the same experience with my father as he had with his father.
Feynman ' s style -- no , style is not the right word.
If it wasn ' t possible , you had to use something fancier.
There was a theory.
And it sort of worked , but it didn ' t work very well.
Feynman decided , as a sort of amateur helium physicist , that he would try to figure it out.
The small number of simple principles were very , very simple.
So he sat down -- and I imagine he had nothing more than a simple piece of paper and a pencil -- and he tried to write down , and did write down , the simplest function that he could think of which had the boundary conditions that the wave function vanish when things touch and is smooth in between.
I ' ve always wondered whether the professionals , the real professional helium physicists , were just a little bit embarrassed by this.
He did it again in 1968.
And the way to analyze it was , of course , Feynman diagrams.
This was the thing the Feynman diagrams were for.
But you couldn ' t ; they were just too complicated.
Feynman said ,  " Forget all of that.
Because they ' re moving real fast , relativity says the internal motions go very slow.
You see a frozen bunch of partons.
This was the key to analyzing these experiments.
So I think I ' ll just finish up by saying I actually don ' t think Feynman would have liked this event.
I think the answer is we should honor Feynman by getting as much baloney out of our own sandwiches as we can.

When this trailer showed up at my shop in Berkeley , I ' d actually never stepped foot in an Airstream trailer , or any other trailer.
In that the shell was originally conceived as a lightweight , modern , futuristic , high-tech pod for hurtling down the freeway , and the interiors were completely out of sync with that.
We stripped out all the vinyl and zolatone paint that was covering up this just fantastic aluminum shell.
The biggest difficulty on one of these trailers is that when you ' re designing there ' s actually no logical place to stop and start materials because of the continuous form of the trailer.
It ' s a compound curve interior.
They also gave us a way to run power and rewire the trailer without tearing out the skin , so they function as an electrical chase.
Teruo Kurosaki , who owns a furniture company called Idee , he asked me to ship him two trailers to Tokyo.
This trailer housed two turntables , mixer , wet bar , fridge , integrated sound system.
This brings us up to the time that I started consulting to Airstream.
Anyway , I went out to Airstream about six times during the process of building this prototype , and it ' s called the Bambi prototype.
The trailers themselves are actually hand-built.
http://www.ted.com/talks/gever_tulley_on_5_dangerous_things_for_kids.html
Gever Tulley 5 dangerous things you should let your kids do
I ' m Gever Tulley.
And I do put power tools into the hands of second-graders.
We put suffocation warnings on all the -- on every piece of plastic film manufactured in the United States or for sale with an item in the United States.
When we round every corner and eliminate every sharp object , every pokey bit in the world , then the first time that kids come in contact with anything sharp or not made out of round plastic , they ' ll hurt themselves with it.
And what I now present to you is an excerpt from a book in progress.
Learning to control one of the most elemental forces in nature is a pivotal moment in any child ' s personal history.
This is like one of the great things we ever discovered , fire.
You don ' t know what they ' re going to learn from playing with it.
Your first -- your first pocketknife is like the first universal tool that you ' re given.
These are Inuit children cutting whale blubber.
And yeah , they ' re going to cut themselves.
It turns out that our brains are actually wired for throwing things and , like muscles , if you don ' t use parts of your brain , they tend to atrophy over time.
These kinds of target-based practice also helps kids develop attention and concentration skills.
Next time you ' re about to throw out an appliance , don ' t throw it out.
So these black boxes that we live with and take for granted are actually complex things made by other people and you can understand them.
It ' s a very simple exercise -- buy a song on ITunes , write it to a CD , then rip the CD to an MP3 and play it on your very same computer.
And it ' s something we often talk about with the kids when we ' re fooling around with things and breaking them open and taking them apart and using them for other things -- and also when we go out and drive a car.
This happens about the same time that they get latched onto things like dinosaurs , these big things in the outside world that they ' re trying to get a grip on.
Find a big empty lot , make sure there ' s nothing in it and it ' s on private property , and let them drive your car.
I think that ' s it . That ' s number five and a half . OK.

Then I went on to tear my ACL , the ligament in my knee , and then developed an arthritic knee.
Narrator : We are all aware of the risk of cancer , but there ' s another disease that ' s destined to affect even more of us : arthritis.
Common injuries can lead to decades of pain , until our joints quite literally grind to a halt.
This is the field of biologic replacements , where we replace worn-out parts with new , natural ones.
I ' m not ready for joint replacement. " 
And then for the damaged arthritis on the surface , we did a stem cell paste graft , which we designed in 1991 , to regrow that articular cartilage surface and give it back a smooth surface there.
And so we can regrow these surfaces biologically.
And the tissue ' s very expensive.
So if we ' re going to transplant animal tissues to people , we have to figure out a way to get rid of that epitope.
We ' ve now done that procedure , and it ' s been done worldwide in over 4,000 cases , so it ' s an FDA-approved and worldwide-accepted way to regrow the meniscus.
So in that case , I have to design -- and we designed with Uri Galili and Tom Turek -- an enzyme wash to wash away , or strip , those galactosyl epitopes with a specific enzyme.
And we ' ve done that . Now we ' ve taken pig ligament -- young , healthy , big tissue , put it into 10 patients in an FDA-approved trial -- and then one of our patients went on to have three Canadian Masters Downhill championships -- on his  " pig-lig, "  as he calls it . So we know it can work.
How are we going to revolutionize artificial joint replacement ? 
We ' re going to rebuild your knee with the parts.
We can harness those benefits.
And so welcome to super biologics.
It ' s version 2.0 of you.
Jay Walker , curator of the Library of Human Imagination , conducts a surprising show-and-tell session highlighting a few of the intriguing artifacts that backdropped the 2008 TED stage.
These rocks have been hitting our earth for about three billion years , and are responsible for much of what’s gone on on our planet.
This is not a copy.
They would bring them back and mount them.
And it wouldn’t be interesting to talk about the dawn of books without having a copy of a Guttenberg Bible.
In 1455 , nobody could read.
We are living at the age here at the end of the book , where electronic paper will undoubtedly replace it.
They got you out of purgatory faster.
So the printing press , ladies and gentlemen , was driven entirely by the printing of forgivenesses and had nothing to do with reading.
We are going to show , actually , what the library looks like , OK ? 
The room itself is three stories tall.
It’s designed like an Escher print.
There’s my very own Saturn V.
There is a glass bridge that you walk across that’s suspended in space.
So hopefully tomorrow I’ll show one or two more objects from the stage , but for today I just wanted to say thank you for all the people that came and talked to us about it.
It’s all about seeing things that everybody else has seen before but thinking about them in ways that nobody has thought of them before.
But we can also look at an Enigma machine from the Nazis in World War II that was a coding and decoding machine.
And yet , looking at them , you would see a machine and a molecule.
And it’s rare , because we never really get to see a brain.
And I’ll give you a quick example.
And what does a lump of coal have to do with the Internet ? 
So the next time you download a gigabyte , or two gigabytes , it’s not for free , OK ? 
Onstage at TEDGlobal , Péter Fankhauser demonstrates Rezero , a robot that balances on a ball . Designed and built by a group of engineering students , Rezero is the first ballbot made to move quickly and gracefully -- and even dance.
Let me introduce to you Rezero.
The main characteristics of such a system is that there ' s one sole contact point to the ground.
Now we ' ll explain that in a second.
This happens 160 times per second , and if anything fails in this process , Rezero would immediately fall to the ground.
It ' s indeed exactly this instability that allows a robot to move very [dynamically].
For the next demo , I ' d like you to introduce to my colleagues Michael , on the computer , and Thomas who ' s helping me onstage.
In the next mode , we can get Rezero to follow a person.
We call this the orbiting mode.
Rezero could be used in exhibitions or parks.
And of course , who wouldn ' t like to take a ride on one of these.
Thank you.

your voice so soft and muffled ...
So I am one of those people with a transformative personal story.
My current work seems to resonate with people in a way that has so taken me by surprise that I still frequently wonder what in the hell is going on.
Now , this is heresy in the design world.
Where others might look at measurable results , I tend to be interested in more ethereal qualities , like  " Does it bring joy ?  " 
I don ' t have time to explain it , but it has to do with DNA and RNA.
I ' m going to give you a couple of examples of how my brain works.
And puzzling it is.
So here ' s the word puzzle again.
But maybe that ' s a little too obvious.
So ultimately , my goal is to create something unexpected.
And for that same amount of time , I ' ve been spilling sugar on the table and just kind of playing with it with my fingers.
Recently , I ' ve also made some rather highbrow baroque borders out of lowbrow pasta.
Okay , well , it ' s what I can do with some household tinfoil.
So I ' m currently working on a book , which plays with both senses of the word , as I explore some of my own ideas and inquiries in a visual display of rather peacock-like grandeur.
I think that one of the things that religions got right was the use of visual wonder to deliver a message.
But I really hope to have the opportunity to change that perception.
So I do these valentines.
But in 2007 , I got the cockamamie idea to hand-draw each valentine for everyone on my mailing list.
I was very busy in the beginning of that year , and I didn ' t know when I was going to find time to design and print a single valentine.
I got an almost 100 percent response rate.
I wanted it to be something that was not addressed to them or signed by me , something that caused them to wonder what on Earth this thing was.
And they ' re on the one hand , universal , so I avoid specific names or places , but on the other hand , they ' re personal.
Just please accept that this piece of you escapes with your smile , and those of us who notice are happy to catch it in passing.
Impossible ?  I don ' t think so.
So Valentine ' s Day is coming up in a couple of days , and these are currently arriving in mailboxes all around the world.
I ' m just really , really thrilled with them.
What is it that ' s worth spending my time on and my life on in this way ? 
What makes something worthwhile for me is the people I work for or with , the conditions I work under and the audience that I ' m able to reach.
You know , I have to tell you , it ' s really difficult for someone like me to come up on stage at this conference with these unbelievably brilliant minds , who are thinking these really big-picture , world-changing , life-changing ideas and technologies.
Just in the way that I ' m inspired by books and magazines of all kinds , conversations I have , movies , so I also think , when I put visual work out there into the mass media , work that is interesting , unusual , intriguing , work that maybe opens up that sense of inquiry in the mind , that I ' m seeding the imagination of the populace.
But I really believe that a fully operating , rich society needs these seeds coming from all directions and all disciplines in order to keep the gears of inspiration and imagination flowing and cycling and growing.

Woody Norris invents amazing things
And it was an arm that , instead of hinging and pivoting as it went across the record , went straight : a radial , linear tracking tone arm.
My 44th patent ; about the 15th invention.
And I say , What is the light bulb good for ? 
Light came out of it in every direction.
That ' s the way loudspeakers pretty much are.
If the light bulb was the way the speaker is , and you couldn ' t focus or sharpen the edges or define it , we wouldn ' t have that , or movies in general , or computers , or T.V . sets , or C.D.s , or DVDs -- and just go down the list of what the importance is of being able to focus light.
What if I could aim sound the way I aim light ? 
The sound is being made right next to your ears . Is that cool ? 
They tried this back in the  ' 60s and were too smart , and so they gave up.
Too many other smart people out there . So.
And we ' re living in a great time right now , because almost everything ' s being explored anew.
And this is , I hope , a little piece of it.
Now , they ' ve tried this a couple years ago and it failed , because the checker gets tired of hearing the same message every 20 minutes , and reaches out , turns off the sound.
And hopefully they ' ll be sensitive that they don ' t want to offend you with just one more outlet.
Sit in bed , two in the morning , watch TV ; your spouse , or someone , is next to you , asleep ; doesn ' t hear it , doesn ' t wake up.
We ' ve been selling it since about last September , October , and it ' s been immensely gratifying.
Now , when I played it for you , you didn ' t hear the thunderous bass.
The air is not linear , as we ' ve always been taught.
Now , imagine , if you will , without getting too technical , I ' m making a little sine wave here in the air.
Hypersonic sound is exactly the opposite : it ' s 100 percent based on non-linearity.
I said we can shorten the column , we can spread it out to cover the couch.
So , the stage is more restricted -- the sound stage that ' s supposed to spread out in front of you.
So , we ' ve been , as I say , very successful , very lucky , in having companies catch the vision of this , from cars -- car makers who want to put a stereo system in the front for the kids , and a separate system in the back -- oh , no , the kids aren ' t driving today.
So , again , this idea of being able to put sound anywhere you want to is really starting to catch on.
Or you can whisper in the ear of a supposed terrorist some Biblical verse.
Pain is 120.
I have a bunch of other inventions.
We ' ve got a problem with the antenna ringing.
That ' s a fluorescent tube refined. " 
That ' s my invention . I sold that for seven million dollars.
I ' m the happiest guy you ' re ever going to meet.
Let me give you , in the last minute , one more quick demo of this guy , for those of you that haven ' t heard it.
Get the cameraman.
Appreciate it very much.

This abalone shell is a biocomposite material that ' s 98 percent by mass calcium carbonate and two percent by mass protein.
Part of it is that these materials are macroscopic in structure , but they ' re formed at the nanoscale.
So that ' s the vision that I ' ve been thinking about.
Here ' s how to do it at room temperature and pressure , using non-toxic materials. " 
So what if you could do the same thing with a solar cell or a battery ? 
So when we think about future technologies , we actually think of using bacteria and virus , simple organisms.
And very rapidly , they became multi-cellular , they could replicate , they could use photosynthesis as a way of getting their energy source.
And so that ' s what I would like be able to do -- convince biology to work with the rest of the periodic table.
But what if we could convince them to build a solar cell for us ? 
There ' s diatoms made out of SIO2 , and they ' re magnetotactic bacteria that make small , single-domain magnets used for navigation.
And they can pull calcium out of the environment , put down a layer of calcium and then carbonate , calcium and carbonate.
And so here ' s the periodic table.
And so I give this out to thousands of people.
What if he says ,  ' Oh , I already have one, '  or ,  ' I ' ve already memorized it '  ?  " 
And so he looked at it , and he said ,  " Thank you . I ' ll look at it periodically. " 
And that ' s a hard sell to a graduate student.
Well it has a simple DNA structure that you can go in and cut and paste additional DNA sequences into it.
And so you can go in and have a billion different viruses that are all genetically identical , but they differ from each other based on their tips , on one sequence that codes for one protein.
Once you find that one out of a billion , you infect it into a bacteria , and you make millions and billions of copies of that particular sequence.
We engineered a virus to pick up carbon nanotubes.
And so through a process of selection evolution , we went from being able to have a virus that made a crummy battery to a virus that made a good battery to a virus that made a record-breaking , high-powered battery that ' s all made at room temperature , basically at the bench top.
Now if we could scale this , you could actually use it to run your Prius , which is my dream -- to be able to drive a virus-powered car.
We ' re able to do this also with catalysis.
And I brought an example with me of that today.
In this case , you ' re seeing oxygen bubbles come out.
We ' ve been able to engineer viruses to pick up carbon nanotubes and then grow titanium dioxide around them -- and use as a way of getting electrons through the device.
Through evolution and selection , we took it from an eight percent efficiency solar cell to an 11 percent efficiency solar cell.
business,creativity,culture,design,technology,work
But let ' s , sort of , start at the beginning.
And so what they typically do is they decide that all these people need to come together in one place to do that work.
They fill it with tables , or desks , chairs , computer equipment , software , Internet access , maybe a fridge , maybe a few other things , and they expect their employees , or their volunteers , to come to that location every day to do great work.
If you ask people the question : where do you really need to go when you need to get something done ? 
So here ' s some examples.
And then you ' ll hear things like the train , a plane , a car -- so , the commute.
What is that about ? 
That ' s what happens at the office.
Then you ' ve got 15 minutes , and someone pulls you aside and asks you this question , and before you know it , it ' s 5 p.m. , and you look back on the day , and you realize that you didn ' t get anything done.
I was at work.
I did these conference calls . I did all this stuff.
And what you find is that , especially with creative people -- designers , programmers , writers , engineers , thinkers -- that people really need long stretches of uninterrupted time to get something done.
How about seven hours ? 
Very , very few people actually have long stretches of uninterrupted time at an office.
I think that sleep and work are very closely related , and it ' s not just that you can work while you ' re sleeping and you can sleep while you ' re working.
There ' s five of them , and in order to get to the really deep ones , the really meaningful ones , you have to go through the early ones.
And what ends up happening -- sometimes you might have days like this where you wake up at eight in the morning , or seven in the morning , or whenever you get up , and you ' re like , man , I didn ' t really sleep very well.
So how do we expect -- does anyone here expect someone to sleep well if they ' re interrupted all night ? 
That doesn ' t really seem like it makes a lot of sense to me.
They ' ll also say -- sometimes they ' ll also say ,  " Well , if I can ' t see the person , how do I know they ' re working ?  " 
We all have to improve on this sort of thing.
It turns out that those aren ' t the things that are really distracting.
You decide when you want to go downstairs or go for a walk.
Some of you may work at places where you can ' t get to these certain sites.
And today ' s Facebook and Twitter and YouTube , these things are just modern-day smoke breaks.
Those are the real problems in the modern office today.
So these are the things that you don ' t find elsewhere , but you do find at the office.
And we have a lot of managers in the world now , and there ' s a lot of people in the world now , and there ' s a lot of interruptions in the world now because of these managers.
But what ' s even worse is the thing that managers do most of all , which is call meetings.
The manager calls the meeting so the employees can all come together , and it ' s an incredibly disruptive thing to do to people -- is to say ,  " Hey look , we ' re going to bring 10 people together right now and have a meeting.
What if they ' re thinking about something important ? 
Because meetings aren ' t work.
There ' s often too many people in the meetings , and they ' re very , very expensive to the organization.
But instead , there ' s a long scheduled meeting , because meetings are scheduled the way software works , which is in increments of 15 minutes , or 30 minutes , or an hour.
And so we tend to fill these times up when things should really go really quickly.
What can managers do -- enlightened managers , hopefully -- what can they do to make the office a better place for people to work , so it ' s not the last resort , but it ' s the first resort ? 
I have about three minutes , so that ' ll fit perfectly.
How about -- pick one Thursday once a month and cut that day in half and just say the afternoon -- I ' ll make it really easy for you.
And what you ' ll find is that a tremendous amount of work actually gets done when no one talks to each other.
It ' s better than a new monitor . It ' s better than new software , or whatever people typically use.
So maybe it ' s every other week , or every week , once a week , afternoons no one can talk to each other.
You can quit the email app ; you can ' t quit your boss.
So you ' re going to be kind of going up and doing some work , and then you ' re going to come down from that work , and then maybe it ' s time to check that email , or check that I.M.
Today ' s Friday -- so Monday , usually people have meetings on Monday.
All these discussions and decisions you thought you had to make at this one time at 9 a.m . on Monday , just forget about them , and things will be just fine.
And I think it ' ll all pay off in the end.

And I specialize in human behavioral research , and applying what we learn to think about the future in different ways , and to design for that future.
It ' s not in the lab , and it ' s increasingly in places like India , China , Brazil , Africa.
And I mention this because , if we want to design for that future , we need to figure out what those people are about.
If you think of everything in your life that you own , when you walk out that door , what do you consider to take with you ? 
So this is interesting to us , because the conscious and subconscious decision process implies that the stuff that you do take with you and end up using has some kind of spiritual , emotional or functional value.
I go in their homes . And we do this worldwide , and we follow them around town with video cameras.
OK , that ' s fair enough.
You ' d probably kick me out , or something.
And it turns out , from our research , that it boils down to survival -- survival for us and survival for our loved ones.
If you prefer this kind of Maslow ' s hierarchy of needs , those three objects are very good at supporting the lowest rungs in Maslow ' s hierarchy of needs.
And you can transcend time by sending a message at your convenience , and someone else can pick it up at their convenience.
And you can do them with phone kiosks.
But -- and it ' s a pretty big but -- we forget.
And so we have these strategies to remember , and one of them was mentioned yesterday.
And you turn around , and you look back into the space , and some people talk aloud.
And these things don ' t stay in the center of gravity , but over time , they gravitate there.
And that is , quite simply , to have nothing to remember.
And it turns out , delegation -- if you want it to be -- can be the solution for pretty much everything , apart from things like bodily functions , going to the toilet.
So , let me give you an example of delegation in practice , right.
And one of the things we were looking at is -- if you can ' t read and write , if you want to communicate over distances , you need to be able to identify the person that you want to communicate with.
Just from a design perspective , we didn ' t really understand how they did it , and so that ' s just one small example of the kind of research that we were doing.
This one ' s a little bit more sophisticated , and this is from a study that we did in Uganda about how people who are sharing devices , use those devices.
So let ' s say , June , you ' re in a village , rural village.
And it ' s quite likely that they ' d have a quite simple mobile phone as a phone kiosk.
So , they ' re topping up the value from Kampala , and it ' s now being topped up in the village.
It brings rudimentary banking services to places where there ' s no banking infrastructure.
And , yes , there are things like Grameen Bank and micro-lending.
And OK , if you break one of these things here , you return it to the carrier.
If you go on the streets of India and China , you see this kind of stuff.
This is a kind of hacker ' s manual , and it ' s written in Chinese and English.
But what I like about this is , it boils down to someone on the street with a small , flat surface , a screwdriver , a toothbrush for cleaning the contact heads -- because they often get dust on the contact heads -- and knowledge.
OK , for me the street just raises so many different questions.
I ' m not going to answer that , OK.
And I look at something like this , and honestly , you know , why would someone design underpants with a pocket , right ? 
This doesn ' t have house numbers . This has phone numbers.
This is how it ' s shifting.
You can see the chai being poured in the background.
For me , this kind of personifies this connected world , where everything is intertwined , and the dots are -- it ' s all about the dots joining together.
So , the first thing is the immediacy of ideas , the speed at which ideas go around.
And what I mean by that is , as these become smaller , as the functionality that you can access through this becomes greater -- things like banking , identity -- these things quite simply move very quickly around the world.
In ways that , despite our resources , they can do it better than us.
With another three billion people connected , they want to be part of the conversation.
http://www.ted.com/talks/renny_gleeson_on_antisocial_phone_tricks.html
What I wanted to talk to you about today is two things : one , the rise of a culture of availability ; and two , a request.
And the problem is , we ' re still working through , from a societal standpoint , how we allow people to be available.
This first one ' s called  " the lean. " 
OK , the gentleman on the left is saying ,  " Screw you , I ' m going to check my device. " 
Nothing says  " I love you "  like  " Let me find somebody else I give a damn about. " 
That is actually the device.
Look around you.
This poor kid , clearly a prop -- don ' t get me wrong , a willing prop -- but the kiss that ' s being documented kind of looks like it sucks.
People aren ' t simply projecting identity , they ' re creating it.
http://www.ted.com/talks/dean_ornish_says_your_genes_are_not_your_fate.html
Dean Ornish says your genes are not your fate
When you eat healthier , manage stress , exercise and love more , your brain actually gets more blood flow and more oxygen.
Now , there ' s some things that you can do to make your brain grow new brain cells.
And other things that can make it worse , that can cause you to lose brain cells.
We ' ve shown that you can actually reverse heart disease.
We ' ve shown you may be able to stop and reverse the progression of early prostate cancer and , by extension , breast cancer , simply by making these changes.
One of the most effective anti-smoking ads was done by the Department of Health Services , showing that nicotine , which constricts your arteries , can cause a heart attack or a stroke , but it also causes impotence.
This is what ' s called a heat map -- and the different colors -- and along the side , on the right , are different genes.
Well , our genes are not our fate , and if we make these changes -- they ' re a predisposition -- but if we make bigger changes than we might have made otherwise , we can actually change how our genes are expressed.

And that ' s Johnny Depp ' s famous shoulder tattoo.
So like Johnny Depp , and like 25 percent of Americans between the ages of 16 and 50 , I have a tattoo.
I got my tattoo when I was 29 , and I regretted it instantly.
And this was all actually quite shocking to me , because prior to this moment , I had prided myself on having absolutely no regrets.
I learned a lesson from it.
This idea is nicely captured by this quote :  " Things without all remedy should be without regard ; what ' s done is done. " 
And as it happens , Shakespeare was onto something here , as he generally was.
So if , in fact , you want to live a life free of regret , there is an option open to you.
What is regret ? 
And second of all , it requires imagination.
You ' re going to experience more regret in that situation if you missed your flight by three minutes than if you missed it by 20.
I should have gone through that yellow light. " 
This session today is about behavioral economics.
Here ' s what the answers turn out to look like.
We wish we ' d taken better advantage of the education that we did have.
So in other words , we know most of what we know about regret by the study of finance.
Odds are , you ' re not going to care in five years.
But it turns out that regret feels awful in four very specific and consistent ways.
And the thought was ,  " Make it go away! " 
We ' re not trying to understand how the problem came about.
What was I thinking ?  " 
And we certainly don ' t have any empathy for that part -- which explains the third consistent component of regret , which is an intense desire to punish ourselves.
Now the effect of perseveration is to basically take these first three components of regret and put them on an infinite loop.
So if you look at the psychological literature , these are the four consistent defining components of regret.
And then I thought about how , much as travel insurance doesn ' t cover acts of God , probably my health insurance did not cover acts of idiocy.
And I think it ' s particularly painful for us now in the West in the grips of what I sometimes think of as a Control-Z culture -- Control-Z like the computer command , undo.
Sometimes instead of Control-Z , we actually have zero control.
So for instance , here ' s one of my favorite automatic generators of regret in modern life.
Or you can just have an incredibly embarrassing day at work.
Now obviously , those kinds of regrets are incredibly piercing and enduring.
And the first of these is to take some comfort in its universality.
And that ' s just regret about tattoos.
But it might seem like a kind of cruel or glib suggestion when it comes to these more profound regrets.
The third way that I think we can help make our peace with regret is through the passage of time , which , as we know , heals all wounds -- except for tattoos , which are permanent.
Actually , you know what , I should warn you , you ' re going to be disappointed.
It ' s just that I don ' t like how it looks.
I can guess what some of you are thinking.
And when I came and settled in New York afterward , I was worried that I would forget some of the most important lessons that I learned during that time.
Well it did.
Here ' s the thing , if we have goals and dreams , and we want to do our best , and if we love people and we don ' t want to hurt them or lose them , we should feel pain when things go wrong.
Regret doesn ' t remind us that we did badly.

We live in a world that everyone knows is interdependent , but insufficient in three major ways.
The percentage of working families without health care up by four percent.
And perhaps most important of all , it is unsustainable because of climate change , resource depletion and species destruction.
In other words , they thought their differences were more important than their common humanity.
Because primarily of the power of the Internet , people of modest means can band together and amass vast sums of money that can change the world for some public good if they all agree.
The median contribution was somewhere around 57 dollars.
There are now a couple of hundred thousand.
I wanted to focus on activities that would help to alleviate poverty , fight disease , combat climate change , bridge the religious , racial and other divides that torment the world , but to do it in a way that would either use whatever particular skills we could put together in our group to change the way some public good function was performed so that it would sweep across the world more.
When I got out of office and was asked to work , first in the Caribbean , to try to help deal with the AIDS crisis , generic drugs were available for about 500 dollars a person a year.
So the very first week we were working , we got the price down to 500 dollars.
I joked that the main contribution we made to the battle against AIDS was to get the manufacturers to change from a jewelry store to a grocery store strategy.
Children ' s medicine was 600 dollars , because nobody could afford to buy any of it.
The only thing that is keeping us from basically saving the lives of everybody who needs the medicine to stay alive are the absence of systems necessary to diagnose , treat and care for people and deliver this medicine.
And it occurred to me that in this whole non-governmental world , somebody needs to be thinking about organizing public goods markets.
When Al Gore won his well-deserved Oscar for the  " Inconvenient Truth "  movie , I was thrilled , but I had urged him to make a second movie quickly.
And all of you need to have it embedded in your brains and to organize yourselves around it.
It has been my experience in working in developing countries that while the headlines may all be -- the pessimistic headlines may say , well , we can ' t do this , that or the other thing because of corruption -- I think incapacity is a far bigger problem in poor countries than corruption , and feeds corruption.
The systems are not there to reach the people.
And two , will it do it at a price that will enable the country to sustain a health care system without foreign donors after five to 10 years ? 
In a world with no systems , with chaos , everything becomes a guerilla struggle , and this predictability is not there.
And they ' ve achieved a lot of other amazing health results.
And so we have set about doing that.
The procedures that make this work have been perfected , as I said , by Paul Farmer and his team in their work in rural Haiti over the last 20 years.
We have about 500 people around the world working in our AIDS program , some of them for nothing -- just for transportation , room and board.
She was CEO of a successful e-venture -- she started and built Reed Elsevier Ventures -- and at 45 she decided she wanted to do something different with her life.
When we came to this rural area , 45 percent of the children under the age of five had stunted growth due to malnutrition.
Over 13 percent of the deaths were from respiratory illnesses -- again , all preventable and treatable.
Listen to this : less than four-tenths of one percent of those being treated stopped taking their medicine or otherwise defaulted on treatment.
That ' s about 43 percent of all the pregnancies.
We ' ve started the first malaria treatment programs they ' ve ever had there.
And for those of you who understand healthcare economics you know that all wealthy countries spend between nine and 11 percent of GDP on health care , except for the United States , we spend 16 -- but that ' s a story for another day.
We need initial upfront investment to train doctors , nurses , health administration and community health workers throughout the country , to set up the information technology , the solar energy , the water and sanitation , the transportation infrastructure.
It has been an honor for me , particularly , to work in Rwanda where we also have a major economic development project in partnership with Sir Tom Hunter , the Scottish philanthropist , where last year we , using the same thing with AIDS drugs , cut the cost of fertilizer and the interest rates on microcredit loans by 30 percent and achieved three- to four-hundred percent increases in crop yields with the farmers.
I ' m doing my best to convince them not to run the electric grid to the 35 percent of the people that have no access , but to do it with clean energy . To have responsible reforestation projects , the Rwandans , interestingly enough , have been quite good , Mr . Wilson , in preserving their topsoil.
We could use some more help to do this , but think of what it would mean if we could have a world-class health system in Rwanda -- in a country with a less-than-one-dollar-a-day-per-capita income , one that could save hundreds of millions of lives over the next decade if applied to every similarly situated country on Earth.
Join John Hardy on a tour of the Green School , his off-the-grid school in Bali that teaches kids how to build , garden , create  . The centerpiece of campus is the spiraling Heart of School , perhaps the world ' s largest freestanding bamboo building.
I grew up in a very small village in Canada , and I ' m an undiagnosed dyslexic.
I left when I was 25 years old to go to Bali , and there I met my incredible wife , Cynthia , and together , over 20 years , we built an amazing jewelry business.
I have four kids , and even if part of what he says is true , they ' re not going to have the life that I had.
It has an intact Hindu culture.
And here it is : it ' s called the Green School.
The desks are not square.
Our children spend 181 days going to school in a box.
The classrooms have natural light.
These bubbles are made from natural cotton and rubber from the rubber tree.
We have to teach the kids that the world is not indestructible.
They know they can control their world.
When the turbine drops in , it will produce 8,000 watts of electricity , day and night.
How many people times how much water.
It ' s something you should think about doing.
The teachers dragged giant PVC whiteboards into the classrooms.
I met a father the other day ; he looked a little crazed.
He said ,  " I had a dream once about a green school , and I saw a picture of this green school , I got on an airplane.
And people are bringing their green industries , hopefully their green restaurants , to the Green School.
No petrochemicals in the pavement.
The sidewalks are gravel . They flood when it rains , but they ' re green.
And when the kindergarten kids recently moved their gate , they found out the fence was made out of tapioca.
We dropped them gently in.
They know how to plant organic rice , they know how to look after it , they know how to harvest and they know how to cook it.
Local Balinese women cook the food on sawdust burners using secrets that only their grandmothers know.
The kids are from 25 countries.
But you also learn other things.
The kids love it.
And we were right.
A woman came from Africa with music.
But what ' s happening , our learning-different kids -- dyslexic -- we ' ve renamed them prolexic -- are doing well in these beautiful , beautiful classrooms.
It ' s bamboo.
When the architects came , they brought us these things , and you ' ve probably seen things like this.
It has administrators in it and many , many other things.
And Balinese carpenters like this measured them with their bamboo rulers , selected the bamboo and built the buildings using age-old techniques , mostly by hand.
From the time the foundations were finished , in three months it had roofs and floors.
Green School is a model we built for the world.
You ruined my life , but you gave me an incredible future.
When film critic Roger Ebert lost his lower jaw to cancer , he lost the ability to eat and speak . But he did not lose his voice . In a moving talk from TED2011 , Ebert and his wife , Chaz , with friends Dean Ornish and John Hunter , come together to tell his remarkable story.
Roger Ebert : These are my words , but this is not my voice.
In those days , I was living in a fool ' s paradise.
Maybe I wasn ' t as smart , but I was at least as talkative.
I will start with my wife , Chaz.
My tongue , larynx and vocal cords were still healthy and unaffected.
Two weeks later , I was ready to return home.
Thank God I was still in my hospital room and my doctors were right there.
And then a third attempt , which also patched me back together pretty well , until it failed.
Human speech is an ingenious manipulation of our breath within the sound chamber of our mouth and respiratory system.
Dean Ornish : At first for a long time , I wrote messages in notebooks.
 " It was the clearest I could find.
There are all sorts of html codes you can use to control the timing and inflection of computer voices , and I ' ve experimented with them.
But what value do we place on the sound of our own voice ? 
How did I feel not being able to speak ? 
So Chaz suggested finding a company that could make a customized voice using my TV show voice from a period of 30 years.
But I decided then to just give it a try.
But they were willing to give it a try.
But it wasn ' t that simple.
And here ' s the voice we call Roger Jr.
This is the first version of my computer voice.
When I read something , it will read in my voice.
This is the first voice they ' ve created for an individual.
Many blind people use them to read pages on the Web to themselves.
The good people in Scotland are still improving my voice , and I ' m optimistic about it.
A very large sample is needed.
On Wednesday , David Christian explained to us what a tiny instant the human race represents in the time-span of the universe.
In cosmological terms , that was about 10 minutes ago.
When I heard the amazing talk by Salman Khan on Wednesday , about the Khan Academy website that teaches hundreds of subjects to students all over the world , I had a flashback.
This was a computer-assisted instruction system , which in those days ran on a computer named ILLIAC.
The point is PLATO was only 50 years ago , an instant in time.
But I ' m not here from the Chamber of Commerce.
I was in line at Radio Shack to buy one of the first Model 100 ' s.
 " The Sun Times sent me to the Cannes Film Festival with a portable computer the size of a suitcase named the Porteram Telebubble.
It makes me incredibly fortunate to live at this moment in history.
And because of it , I can communicate as well as I ever could.
I cannot speak ; I can only type so fast.
They give me a way to speak.
Every time there was a surgery that failed , I was left with a little less flesh and bone.
When you see me today , I look like the Phantom of the Opera.
Excuse me.
Believe me , he didn ' t mean this as -- anyway , let me just read it.
That ' s why writing on the Internet has become a lifesaver for me.
One of my Twitter friends can type only with his toes.
So I have not come here to complain.
I am productive.
RE : Wait . I have one more thing to add.
The psychiatrist says ,  " All right , you ' re ugly. " 
I now propose a test for computer voices -- the Ebert test.
business,creativity,culture,design,media
Readers don ' t want to pay for yesterday ' s news , and advertisers follow them.
So , should we rather ask ,  " Can anything save newspapers ?  " 
And we ' d rather read it during breakfast , because later we listen to radio in a car , check your mail at work and in the evening you watch TV.
Let me tell you my story.
I decided to be -- to work for them as an art director.
I came to London , and I ' ve seen performance by Cirque du Soleil.
The front page became our signature.
I wanted my artistic statement , my interpretation of reality.
Soon it started to bring results.
The secret is that we were treating the whole newspaper as one piece , as one composition -- like music.
We treated two pages , both spreads , as a one page , because that ' s how readers perceive it.
And two years later , the same award came to Estonia.
Same in Poland : plus 13 , up to 35 percent raise of circulation after three years.
Did design do this ? 
And I put strategy at the top of it.
My bosses , in the beginning , were very surprised.
The first lesson is about that design can change not just your product.
Give power to designers.
You can have no budgets , no people -- but still can put your work to the highest possible level.
Thank you.

You will recall that in 1976 , June 16 , the students of South Africa boycotted the language of Afrikaans as the medium of the oppressor , as they were sort of like really told that they must do everything in Afrikaans -- biology , mathematics -- and what about our languages ? 
And I joined , later on , the youth organization under the African National Congress.

When I was 22 years old , I came home from work , put a leash on my dog and went for my usual run.
And I remember putting my hands on the ground and feeling my life ' s blood emptying out of my neck and my mouth.
My left leg got caught up in the wheel well -- spun it around.
It ' s your major artery , and it was severed , so my blood was gurgling out of my mouth.
Somebody was smart and put a Bic pen in my neck to open up my airway so that I could get some air in there.
18 months later I woke up.
And in fact , they started to call me a Gomer.
I had lots of titanium put in me , cadaver bones to try to get my feet moving the right way.
I had more than 50 surgeries.
Everybody lost faith in me being able to recover.
So there were all these skills and talents that these seniors had.
At that point , I had gained four pounds , so I was 68 lbs.
And I had a white cane in one hand and a suitcase full of medical records in another hand.
So they eventually started matching their talents and skills to all of my needs.
And they went through that process.
And then the next thing that I needed was a makeover.
So eventually what went on is they decided that , well I need to learn to speak.
You learn things unconsciously.
They were going to make it fun for me.
And a former teacher who happened to have Alzheimer ' s took on the task of teaching me to write.
So close your eyes.
One was post-traumatic stress disorder.
If it ' s hit , don ' t cross the street. " 
10 years later I gained my sight back.
They removed a hematoma from behind my eye.
So I was walking around it.
But when you ' re blind , you have the tactile memory for things.
We didn ' t have words like crowd-sourcing and radical collaboration when I had my accident.
http://www.ted.com/talks/marcus_du_sautoy_symmetry_reality_s_riddle.html
Marcus du Sautoy : Symmetry , reality ' s riddle
He was a well-known revolutionary in Paris at the time.
It wasn ' t , in fact , revolutionary politics for which Galois was famous.
This is how he wrote most of his mathematics.
Maybe the fact that he stayed up all night doing mathematics was the fact that he was such a bad shot that morning and got killed.
For example , molecular structure.
And it uses the efficiency of symmetry to be able to propagate itself so well.
Because it is hard to make symmetry.
Or what ' s not happening in the Large Hadron Collider in CERN.
It is written in mathematical language , and the letters are triangles , circles and other geometric figures , without which means it is humanly impossible to comprehend a single word. " 
Here is Thomas Mann talking about symmetry in  " The Magic Mountain. " 
And he took me up to the temples in Nikko.
And I said to Professor Kurokawa ,  " Wow , the architects must have really been kicking themselves when they realized that they ' d made a mistake and put this one upside down. " 
Even when building the Imperial Palace , they always leave one place unfinished.
This is my son Tamer . You can see he ' s really enjoying our mathematical trip to the Alhambra.
You see it already . Immediately you go in , the reflective symmetry in the water.
And so what is symmetry ? 
And it was Galois who produced a language to be able to answer some of these questions.
What can you do to something ?  You close your eyes.
And if you open your eyes again , you wouldn ' t know that they ' d moved.
So I ' m going to take you through , perhaps push you a little bit mathematically -- so brace yourselves -- push you a little bit to understand how this language works , which enables us to capture what is symmetry.
Well , there I rotated it by a sixth of a turn , and still it looks like it did before I started.
Now , for Galois , there was actually a sixth symmetry.
But what I could do is just leave it where it is , pick it up , and put it down again.
And this is the same idea . This is a symmetrical -- so everything has symmetry , where you just leave it where it is.
But now this has some reflectional symmetry.
Now , I ' m a great believer that mathematics is not a spectator sport , and you have to do some mathematics in order to really understand it.
How many symmetries does a Rubik ' s Cube have ? 
But let ' s go back down to symmetries that I got for these two objects.
For example , what if I turn the starfish by a sixth of a turn , and then a third of a turn ? 
Well let ' s do that . A sixth of a turn , followed by a third of a turn , the combined effect is as if I had just rotated it by half a turn in one go.
Let ' s see . Let ' s do the third of the turn first , and then the sixth of a turn.
But this is completely different to the symmetries of the triangle.
Now , let ' s do it in a different order.
Now it matters what order you do the operations in.
Take a beer mat and rotate it by a quarter of a turn , then flip it . And then do it in the other order , and the picture will be facing in the opposite direction.
And , using those rules , he was able to say that there are in fact only two objects with six symmetries.
In the front here , I ' ve got one , two , three people sitting on one , two , three chairs.
But , using the language of Galois , we can understand that the underlying abstract symmetries of these things are actually the same.
What about the center of a triangle ?  I can rotate by a third of a turn around the center of the triangle , and everything matches up.
Now , let ' s move to the very different-looking wall in the Alhambra.
And although these walls look very different , Galois has produced a language to say that in fact the symmetries underlying these are exactly the same.
They all look very different . But this language allows us to say that they are representations of the same symmetrical abstract object , which we call 4-4-2 . Nothing to do with football , but because of the fact that there are two places where you can rotate by a quarter of a turn , and one by half a turn.
And they , if you try to produce a different wall with this 18th one , it will have to have the same symmetries as one of these 17.
So I think it ' s a great example of things unseen , which the power of mathematical language allows you to create.
But here is the language which describes how the symmetries interact.
And this thing -- species die away , and moons kind of get hit by meteors and explode -- but this mathematical object will live forever.
Okay , I ' m going to sort you out.
If you think you ' ve got an estimate for how many digits , right -- we ' ve already got one competitor here.
Anybody with five or less digits , you ' ve got to sit down , because you ' ve underestimated.
20 digits or less , sit down.
If I told you 20 or less , stand up.
21 . Okay good . How many do you have in yours ? 
So now I need to name this object.
So Ghez , there we go . That ' s your new symmetrical object.
It ' s all the unanswered questions which make mathematics a living subject.
Every new invention changes the world -- in ways both intentional and unexpected . Historian Edward Tenner tells stories that illustrate the under-appreciated gap between our ability to innovate and our ability to foresee the consequences.
I didn ' t always love unintended consequences , but I ' ve really learned to appreciate them.
And the anthropologist Randall White has made a very interesting observation : that if our ancestors 40,000 years ago had been able to see what they had done , they wouldn ' t have really understood it.
And this is when it really gets interesting.
And I could just imagine the committees reporting back to them on where agriculture was going to take humanity , at least in the next few hundred years.
The skeletal remains from that period have shown that they were grinding grain morning , noon and night.
Even now , our choices are having unintended effects.
That ' s not necessarily a bad unintended consequence.
And that ' s all very true.
So were the followers of Hippocrates.
Now if we look forward a bit to the 19th century , we find a new style of technology.
Thomas Edison would have been very , very comfortable in the atmosphere of a software firm today.
Samuel Clemens , Mark Twain , was a big investor in the most complex machine of all times -- at least until 1918 -- registered with the U.S . Patent Office.
It was such a beautiful machine because it did everything that a human being did in setting type -- including returning the type to its place , which was a very difficult thing.
Now there is something else , though , in the early 20th century that made things even more complicated.
However , there was another case , the Eastland , a ship that capsized in Chicago Harbor in 1915 , and it killed 841 people -- that was 14 more than the passenger toll of the Titanic.
So the 20th century , then , saw how much more complex reality was , but it also saw a positive side.
Penicillin was discovered in 1928 , but even by 1940 , no commercially and medically useful quantities of it were being produced.
And not only did they do it , but within two years , they scaled up penicillin from preparation in one-liter flasks to 10,000-gallon vats.
Now when we come to the period after the Second World War , unintended consequences get even more interesting.
But something else happened in the early 1980s , and that was that there was a mysterious epidemic of failures of tape drives all over the United States.
And these tin particles were deposited on the tape heads and were crashing the tape heads.
In fact , it also shows something interesting , that although our capabilities and technology have been expanding geometrically , unfortunately , our ability to model their long-term behavior , which has also been increasing , has been increasing only arithmetically.
They have combined the list of major innovations , and they ' ve discovered that the greatest number , the greatest decade , for fundamental innovations , as reflected in all of the lists that others have made -- a number of lists that they have merged -- was the Great Depression.
He really was not intending to work in patent research , but he couldn ' t really find an alternative technical job.
What does this mean ? 
And he published that book in the early 1930s , and the book still exists in further editions and is still a fundamental textbook.
So very often , some kind of disaster -- sometimes the consequence , for example , of over-cultivation of silk worms , which was a problem in Europe at the time -- can be the key to something much bigger.
We need to learn from those figures that I mentioned.
And as a result , when we say ,  " This isn ' t brain surgery, "  that pays tribute to how difficult it was for anyone to learn from their mistakes in a field of medicine that was considered so discouraging in its prospects.
http://www.ted.com/talks/anand_agarawala_demos_his_bumptop_desktop.html
Anand Agarawala demos BumpTop
OK . So I mean , this is the kind of status quo interface , right ? 
I mean it ' s point and click , it ' s like the menus , icons , it ' s all the kind of same thing.
So I kind of have a -- this is BumpTop.
And once things are in a pile I can browse them by throwing them into a grid , or you know , flip through them like a book or I can lay them out like a deck of cards.
I just toss it to the pile , and it ' s added right to the top . It ' s a kind of nice way.
So it ' s cute , but it ' s also like a subtle channel of conveying information , right ? 
So one of the things you can do to our icons , just like paper , is crease them and fold them , just like paper . Remember , you know , something for later.
So , one of the criticisms of this kind of approach to organization is that , you know ,  " Okay , well my real desk is really messy . I don ' t want that mess on my computer. " 
Let ' s just break this shelf . Okay , that shelf broke.
And I can do all that kind of same stuff I showed you before.
Kevin Slavin argues that we ' re living in a world designed for -- and increasingly controlled by -- algorithms . In this riveting talk from TEDGlobal , he shows how these complex computer programs determine : espionage tactics , stock prices , movie scripts , and architecture . And he warns that we are writing code we can ' t understand , with implications we can ' t control.
This is a photograph by the artist Michael Najjar , and it ' s real , in the sense that he went there to Argentina to take the photo.
The photo was made when we were deep in the valley over there.
I wonder why.
And it ' s specifically algorithms , which are basically the math that computers use to decide stuff.
And he said ,  " Well we were mostly breaking stealth. " 
And so -- this is an over-simplification -- but basically , it ' s not like you can just pass a radar signal right through 156 tons of steel in the sky.
And he said ,  " Yeah. "  He said ,  " But that ' s if you ' re a radar.
So you ' ve effectively negated 60 years of aeronautic research.
And I said ,  " Oh. " 
And I said ,  " What ' s the black box for Wall Street ?  " 
And if they do that all at once , it ' s like playing poker and going all in right away.
So if you need to have some image of what ' s happening in the stock market right now , what you can picture is a bunch of algorithms that are basically programmed to hide , and a bunch of algorithms that are programmed to go find them and act.
What could go wrong is that a year ago , nine percent of the entire market just disappears in five minutes , and they called it the Flash Crash of 2:45.
And that ' s the thing , is that we ' re writing things , we ' re writing these things that we can no longer read.
And when they find them they pull them out and they pin them to the wall like butterflies.
You can find these kinds of things wherever you look , once you learn how to look for them.
If you had bought it at 1.7 , it would have been a bargain.
And when you see this kind of behavior , what you see is the evidence of algorithms in conflict , algorithms locked in loops with each other , without any human oversight , without any adult supervision to say ,  " Actually , 1.7 million is plenty. " 
They ' re using Pragmatic Chaos now.
Pragmatic Chaos , like all Netflix algorithms , determines , in the end , 60 percent of what movies end up being rented.
Well , a few data scientists from the U.K . are in Hollywood , and they have  " story algorithms "  -- a company called Epagogix.
These aren ' t financial stats ; this is culture.
And they ' re in your house . They ' re in your house.
And the idea that architecture itself is somehow subject to algorithmic optimization is not far-fetched.
And it uses what ' s called a bin-packing algorithm.
People panic.
All it has is just the number that moves up or down and that red button that says ,  " Stop. " 
You can take it really , really far.
And just to give you a sense of what microseconds are , it takes you 500,000 microseconds just to click a mouse.
And of course , it is , but it ' s distributed from places.
These guys down on Wall Street , Marco Polo and Cherokee Nation , they ' re eight microseconds behind all these guys going into the empty buildings being hollowed out up around the Carrier Hotel.
This is a fiber optic cable that was laid between those two cities to just be able to traffic one signal 37 times faster than you can click a mouse -- just for these algorithms , just for the Carnival and the Knife.
This is some mathematicians at MIT.
And the thing that you might have noticed about those blue dots is that a lot of them are in the middle of the ocean.
It ' s what the money motivates , that we ' re actually terraforming the Earth itself with this kind of algorithmic efficiency.
But now there ' s this third co-evolutionary force : algorithms -- the Boston Shuffler , the Carnival.
culture,design,transportation
So , 27 years ago I got a traffic ticket that got me thinking.
Fifty percent of crashes happen at intersections.
But that ' s just safety.
Small roundabouts are starting to appear.
So , take , for example , the three-way intersection.
Cars rarely appear on that third road.
That ' s just the gasoline cost . There is also pollution , wear on the car , and time.
Add that together with the gas , and it ' s $112,000 per year , just for that sign in each direction.
So , it makes one wonder ,  " Why is it there ?  " 
Because there are a lot of people who might live up there and if they ' re waiting forever a long queue could form because the cars aren ' t slowing down on the main road.
So , why not use a yield sign ? 
You couldn ' t suddenly tell everyone ,  " OK , remember what you used to do at yield signs ?  Now do something different. " 
And it merges the stop sign and yield signs.
So , now that you are all  " Road Scholars "  ...
http://www.ted.com/talks/quyen_nguyen_color_coded_surgery.html
Quyen Nguyen : Color-coded surgery
In fact , medicine today is a team sport.
When I make an incision inside a patient ' s body , it ' s dark.
For example , this is the oldest operating room in the Western world , in London , where the operating room is actually on top of a church with a skylight coming in.
Here it is on the top of the building with plenty of windows to let light in.
And this is what I think is the magic of fluorescence.
That ' s so easy anybody could become a surgeon , right ? 
It ' s done , it ' s out , you ' re cured of cancer.
That ' s what the surgeon is saying in the operating room when the patient ' s on the table.
The nurses , anesthesiologist , the surgeon , all the assistants are waiting around.
So if you ' ve sent three specimens , it ' s an hour later.
And this whole process :  " Okay you ' re done.
So now you ' re faced with telling your patient , first of all , that they may need another surgery , or that they need additional therapy such as radiation or chemotherapy.
Roger and his team were working on a way to detect cancer , and they had a very clever molecule that they had come up with.
Nothing will be specific.
So when those two are together , the molecule is neutral and nothing gets stuck down.
However , in the presence of the tumor , now there are molecular scissors that can break this molecule apart right there at the cleavable site.
I couldn ' t when I was working on this.
We can tell in the operating room , in the field , at a molecular level , where is the cancer and what the surgeon needs to do and how much more work they need to do to cut that out.
In this movie , you can see that the tumor is green.
So that ' s the beauty of having a tumor that ' s labeled with fluorescent molecules.
Women used to get really debilitating surgeries to excise all of the axillary lymph nodes.
But sentinel lymph node , the way that we do it today , is kind of like having a road map just to know where to go.
So that takes more time.
So with our technology , we can tell right away.
That doesn ' t mean that there ' s cancer inside.
Well you can see this on an MRI.
And what I ' m talking about are nerves.
But you know what , these little nerves are so small , in the context of prostate cancer , that they are actually never seen.
We ' re trying to preserve nerves ; we can ' t see where they are.
What ' s the problem ? 
And he brought his whole team with him.
You can see where they are.
We have been able to see nerves for facial expression , for facial movement , for breathing -- every single nerve -- nerves for urinary function around the prostate.
Do you guys know where the margins of this tumor is ? 
But what about the part that goes into the tumor ? 
This was a bit of a breakthrough.
And we showed it to a lot of my surgical colleagues.
What needs to happen now is further development of our technology along with development of the instrumentation that allows us to see this sort of fluorescence in the operating room.
We are focused on making this technology better.
Successful innovation is not a single breakthrough.
It requires one team for the breakthrough and another team to get the breakthrough accepted and adopted.
http://www.ted.com/talks/ed_boyden.html
Ed Boyden : A light switch for neurons
And that ' s that all the sensations , feelings , decisions and actions are mediated by the computer in your head called the brain.
They come in different shapes ; they ' re made out of different molecules.
It ' s one of the cells that seems to be atrophied in disorders like schizophrenia.
As just a second example : these pyramidal cells , large cells , they can span a significant fraction of the brain.
They receive input from thousands of upstream partners and compute their own electrical outputs , which then , if they pass a certain threshold , will go to thousands of downstream partners.
If we could activate cells , we could see what powers they can unleash , what they can initiate and sustain.
Now before I tell you about the technology , the bad news is that a significant fraction of us in this room , if we live long enough , will encounter , perhaps , a brain disorder.
Now in the 20th century , there was some hope that was generated through the development of pharmaceuticals for treating brain disorders , and while many drugs have been developed that can alleviate symptoms of brain disorders , practically none of them can be considered to be cured.
Now some people have gotten some solace from electrical stimulators that are implanted in the brain.
So again , we ' re sent back to the idea of ultra-precise control.
And also it would allow us to have the ultra-precise control we need in order to fix the circuit computations that have gone awry.
If we can install these molecules in neurons somehow , then these neurons would become electrically drivable with light.
So how do we do this ? 
In its membrane , or its boundary , it contains little proteins that indeed can convert light into electricity.
So what we need to do is to take these molecules and somehow install them in neurons.
So this turned out to be very simple to do.
So this is very powerful.
This field has now come to be known as optogenetics.
If we can deliver that gene to these cells -- and they ' re not going to be altered by the expression of the gene , of course -- and then flash blue light over the entire brain network , just these cells are going to be driven.
One of the questions we ' ve confronted is , what are the signals in the brain that mediate the sensation of reward ? 
So if we could figure out what cells they are , we could maybe find new targets for which drugs could be designed or screened against , or maybe places where electrodes could be put in for people who have very severe disability.
This animal ' s going to go to the right-hand side and poke his nose there , and he gets a flash of blue light every time he does that.
Now we can generalize the idea.
And one story I want to tell you about is how can we find targets for treating post-traumatic stress disorder -- a form of uncontrolled anxiety and fear.
The shock isn ' t painful , but it ' s a little annoying.
So what we do is we play that tone again after it ' s been associated with fear.
And the animal ' s going to hear a tone -- and a flash of light occurred there.
And now this next clip is just eight minutes later.
Now over the last couple of years , we ' ve gone back to the tree of life because we wanted to find ways to turn circuits in the brain off.
And we found all sorts of molecules , they ' re called halorhodopsins or archaerhodopsins , that respond to green and yellow light.
Now if drugs fail in epileptic treatment , one of the strategies is to remove part of the brain.
And so we don ' t have data to show you on this front , but we ' re very excited about this.
Maybe 100,000 people have Cochlear implants , which allow them to hear.
There ' s one last elephant in the room , the proteins themselves , which come from algae and bacteria and fungi , and all over the tree of life.
So it ' s early days , to be upfront , but we ' re excited about it.
Now let ' s zoom in on it here , so we can see it in more detail.
It ' s not even clear that a drug could cause this to be restored , because there ' s nothing for the drug to bind to.
And because there ' s so many of these cells in the eye , potentially , they could be very high-resolution cameras.
It ' s a six-arm maze . And there ' s a bit of water in the maze to motivate the mouse to move , or he ' ll just sit there.
So he ' s not using vision to do it.
We ' re going to do exactly what we outlined in the previous slide.
And now you can see , the animal can indeed avoid walls and go to this little platform and make cognitive use of its eyes again.
We ' re developing these tools , but we share them freely with hundreds of groups all over the world , so people can study and try to treat different disorders.
The second thing that I think I heard you say is you can now control the brain in two colors , like an on/off switch.
So with blue light , we can drive information , and it ' s in the form of a one.
EB : Sure , yeah . We ' re hoping to use this as a way of testing what neural codes can drive certain behaviors and certain thoughts and certain feelings , and use that to understand more about the brain.
So we can record information and then drive information back in -- sort of computing what the brain needs in order to augment its information processing.
health,microbiology,science
Buildings are complex ecosystems that are an important source of microbes that are good for us , and some that are bad for us.
The fate of microbes indoors depends on complex interactions with humans , and with the human-built environment.
At the Biology and the Built Environment Center , we carried out a study in a hospital where we sampled air and pulled the DNA out of microbes in the air.
And we also sampled the outdoor air.
But being less diverse is not necessarily good for our health.
And the first things that you can see from this graph is , if you look at the blue data points , which are the mechanically ventilated air , they ' re not simply a subset of the green data points , which are the outdoor air.
So all of you right now are sharing your microbes with one another.
Hospitals use two and a half times the amount of energy as office buildings.
So just as we manage national parks , where we promote the growth of some species and we inhibit the growth of others , we ' re working towards thinking about buildings using an ecosystem framework where we can promote the kinds of microbes that we want to have indoors.

Steven Johnson on the Web as a city
I live right there in the West Village , so the plume was luckily blowing west , away from us.
And it seemed to me looking at that -- that tower burning and then falling , those towers burning and falling -- that in fact , one of the lessons here was that density kills.
And I kind of ruminated on that for a couple of days.
And obviously I ' m physically a very strong person , as you can tell -- -- so I wasn ' t worried about carrying this thing 20 blocks.
And all the people who lived in the neighborhood , who owned restaurants and bars in the neighborhood , were all out there -- had them all open.
The city was there.
They don ' t have a center executive branch that you can take out and cause the whole thing to fail.
If you ' d gone into the minds of the people , well , you would have seen a lot of trauma , and you would have seen a lot of heartache , and you would have seen a lot of things that would take a long time to recover.
The question that I found myself asking to people when I was talking about the book afterwards is -- when you ' ve talked about emergent behavior , when you ' ve talked about collective intelligence , the best way to get people to kind of wrap their heads around that is to ask , who builds a neighborhood ? 
No single person is really the ultimate actor behind the personality of a neighborhood.
And this is increasingly what we ' re starting to see on the Web in a bunch of interesting ways -- most of which weren ' t around , actually , except in very experimental things , when I was writing  " Emergence "  and when the book came out.
This is not the future King of England , although it looks like it.
And , you know , I don ' t want to belittle that . That , in a sense -- to reference what Jeff was talking about yesterday -- that was , in a sense , the kind of interface electricity that powered a lot of the explosion of interest in the Web : that you could put up a link , and somebody could click on it , and it could take you anywhere you wanted to go.
This is what happens when you search  " Steven Johnson "  on Google.
It ' s just that there are so many other people in your navel when you gaze.
Now , they ' re more innovative -- well , Google ' s pretty innovative -- but there are some new twists on this.
And he ' s tracking how many other weblogs linked to those weblogs , and so you have kind of an authority -- a weblog that has a lot of links to it is more authoritative than a weblog that has few links to it.
You can also rank it by the latest posts.
Now what ' s interesting here is that this is a quote from Dave Weinberger , where he talks about everything being purposive in the Web -- there ' s nothing artificial.
I could put up a feed of all those links generated by Technorati on the right-hand side of my page , and they would change as the overall ecology of the Web changes.
Now , what you ' re having here is basically a global brain that you ' re able to do lots of kind of experiments on to see what it ' s thinking.
There ' s a problem with the Google Zeitgeist , which is it often comes back with news that a lot of people are searching for Britney Spears pictures , which is not necessarily news.
So the key thing in terms of these new tools that are kind of plumbing the depths of the global brain , that are sending kind of trace dyes through that whole bloodstream -- the question is , are you finding out something new ? 
Like for instance , this is a Google Share of the TED Conference.
And it turns out , actually , that 42 percent is the Mola mola fish.
I also did -- and I don ' t want to start a little fight in the next panel -- but I did a Google Share analysis of evolution and natural selection.
But what ' s interesting is you can then broaden the search and actually see interesting things and get a sense of what else is out there.
Hubbard apparently started to reach , but besides that , I think it would be good next year.
So the first one is -- these are the bursty words around 1860s -- slaves , emancipation , slavery , rebellion , Kansas.
And OK , I didn ' t learn anything new there as well -- that ' s pretty obvious.
But seriously , actually , what you can see there , in a way that would be very hard to detect otherwise , is Reagan reinventing the political language of the country and shifting to a much more intimate , much more folksy , much more telegenic -- contracting all those verbs.
The question now -- and this is the really interesting question -- is , what kind of higher-level shape is emerging right now in the overall Web ecosystem -- and particularly in the ecosystem of the blogs because they are really kind of at the cutting edge.
So 20 percent of the blogs get 80 percent of the links.
It ' s not being imposed by fiat from above.
if you ' re the first site there , everybody links to you.
And he started looking at interesting newcomers that don ' t have a lot of links , that suddenly get a bunch of links in the last 24 hours.
You ' re not totally in control , but you ' re changing the underlying rules in interesting ways because you have an end result which is maybe a more democratic spread of voices.
Thanks a lot.

Green-minded architect and designer William McDonough asks what our buildings and products would look like if designers took into account  " all children , all species , for all time. " 
In 1962 , with Rachel Carson ' s  " Silent Spring, "  I think for people like me in the world of the making of things , the canary in the mine wasn ' t singing.
But , you know , we ' ve just come from this discussion of what a bird might be.
This is a bird.
That was a nice thing to get.
The fundamental issue is that , for me , design is the first signal of human intentions.
So the question is , what is the first question for designers ? 
So we use the tools of commerce primarily for our work , but the question we bring to it is , how do we love all the children of all species for all time ? 
Because it ' s the thing that ' s happening because we have no other plan.
So , the question is , how many federal officials are ready to move to Ohio and Pennsylvania with their families ? 
So , as Kevin Kelly pointed out , there is no endgame.
Our goal is a delightfully diverse , safe , healthy and just world , with clean air , clean water , soil and power -- economically , equitably , ecologically and elegantly enjoyed , period.
He said ,  " What do you think it ' s like trying to run a country with 400 kinds of cheese ?  " 
We can ask ourselves , what is justice , and is justice blind , or is justice blindness ? 
Is there anybody here who doesn ' t breathe ? 
And if we remember Sheikh Yamani when he formed OPEC , they asked him ,  " When will we see the end of the age of oil ?  " 
This is a hospital monitor from Los Angeles , sent to China.
He has given eyesight to two million people for free.
We ' ve developed a carpet that is continuously recyclable , down to the parts per million.
Here ' s where I come from . I grew up in Hong Kong , with six million people in 40 square miles.
My childhood summers were in the Puget Sound of Washington , among the first growth and big growth.
And this might have worked in Berlin , but we built it in Houston , and the windows are all closed . And with most products appearing not to have been designed for indoor use , this is actually a vertical gas chamber.
In 1984 , we did the first so-called  " green office "  in America for Environmental Defense.
So , all of a sudden , here I am , graduating from high school in 1969 , and this happens , and we realize that  " away "  went away.
It was recently dragged for plankton by scientists , and they found six times as much plastic as plankton.
The book itself is a polymer . It is not a tree.
Well , why don ' t we knock that down and write on it ? 
We ' re adding life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
They get fit together , and then they compete.
We ' re also looking at survival of the fittest , not in just competition terms in our modern context of destroy the other or beat them to the ground , but really to fit together and build niches and have growth that is good.
And we have plenty of energy , so we ' ll solve that problem , but the biology problem ' s tricky , because as we put through all these toxic materials that we disgorge , we will never be able to recover that.
So instead of just growing destruction , we want to grow the things that we might enjoy , and someday the FDA will allow us to make French cheese.
Technical nutrition will be in an order of magnitude of biological nutrition.
Using those intellectual filters , we eliminated [7,962.] We were left with 38 chemicals.
 " And where does it go ?  " 
Technical nutrients -- this is for Shaw Carpet , infinitely reusable carpet.
Wear your old shoes in , your new shoes out.
Here ' s a building for The Gap , where the ancient grasses of San Bruno , California , are on the roof.
These are our tools . These are how we sold it to Ford.
They showed up in five days.
And so I will finish by showing you a new city we ' re designing for the Chinese government.
They ' ll have cities with no energy and no food.
We ' re building a new city next to this city ; look at that landscape.
It ' s a rubber stamp grid that they laid right on that landscape.
So the way we approached this is we studied the hydrology very carefully.
We lay out the building areas.
The waste systems all connect.
And then it makes natural gas , which then goes back into the city to power the fuel for the cooking for the city.
And this is the concept for the top of the city.
And so this is the existing city , and this is the new city.

Now just like the physical maps of our world that have been highly influenced by technology -- think Google Maps , think GPS -- the same thing is happening for brain mapping through transformation.
And this outer layer , this is the vasculature , which is incredible , around a human brain.
Scientists , sort of at the end of the 20th century , learned that they could track blood flow to map non-invasively where activity was going on in the human brain.
On the side here , this is temporal cortex.
It ' s the place where you ' re deciding right now you probably aren ' t going to order the steak for dinner.
So about a hundred years ago , some scientists invented a stain that would stain cells.
So the outer part of that brain is the neocortex.
They ' re probably less cell dense.
And of course , as I mentioned before , since we can now start to map brain function , we can start to tie these into the individual cells.
There are also these smaller cells as you ' ll see.
Each neuron is connected via synapses to up to 10,000 other neurons in your brain.
They ' re proteins that are controlling things like ion channel movement.
We each have 23 pairs of chromosomes.
And the nature of a given cell driving its underlying biochemistry is dictated by which of these 25,000 genes are turned on and at what level they ' re turned on.
We were seeking normal human brains.
There ' s a lot of criteria by which we ' re selecting these brains.
Because what we ' re trying to measure , the RNA -- which is the readout from our genes -- is very labile , and so we have to move very quickly.
So the first thing that we do at the site of collection is we collect what ' s called an MR.
And you can think of this as our satellite view for our map.
The brain is removed from the skull , and then it ' s sliced into one-centimeter slices.
We ' re going to then apply one of those stains to it , and we scan it.
From this , we ' re able to then fragment that brain into further pieces , which then we can put on a smaller cryostat.
And so you can see here , old-fashioned technology of the paintbrush being applied.
And our anatomists are going to go in and take a deeper look at this.
And they can make basically what ' s a reference atlas.
They scribe along a place there.
There ' s a container underneath that ' s collecting that tissue.
This has roughly 60,000 elements on it , so we repeatedly measure various genes of the 25,000 genes in the genome.
This area shown here is an area called the hippocampus.
So roughly , we have 50 million data points for a given human brain.
They don ' t even have to log in to come use this tool , mine this data , find interesting things out with this.
There ' s an operator side on the right that allows you to turn , it allows you to zoom in , it allows you to highlight individual structures.
And each gene gives us a fingerprint.
There ' s some basic things that you would want to understand.
Genes send the instructions to make proteins.
In the side effect profile , etc. , you want to see where those genes are turned on.
We can see this unique fingerprint.
It ' s as interesting a side effect as it could be.
And so these kinds of studies are routinely published by scientists and they ' re great . They analyze large populations.
And so it ' s very important for those researchers that we ' ve created this resource.
And I think every human , we all have different genetic backgrounds , we all have lived separate lives.
And so this shows it ' s not 99 percent , but it ' s roughly 90 percent correspondence at a reasonable cutoff , so everything in the cloud is roughly correlated.
Now what do those differences look like ? 
One is called RELN -- it ' s involved in early developmental cues.
It ' s this dark purple precipitate within the cell that ' s telling us a gene is turned on there.
I think these resources are incredibly valuable.
I ' ll just close by saying that the tools are there , and this is truly an unexplored , undiscovered continent.
Alleviating poverty is more guesswork than science , and lack of data on aid ' s impact raises questions about how to provide it . But Clark Medal-winner Esther Duflo says it ' s possible to know which development efforts help and which hurt -- by testing solutions with randomized trials.
So here it is . You can check : I am short , I ' m French , I have a pretty strong French accent , so that ' s going to be clear in a moment.
That is , every day , 25,000 children die of entirely preventable causes.
Well , here is a thought experiment for you.
Or do you believe the people who tell you that aid is not going to help , on the contrary it might hurt , it might exacerbate corruption , dependence , etc. ? 
Has it done any good ? 
Africans have already got a lot of aid.
Maybe it would have been much worse , or maybe it would have been better.
To give the aid , and hope and pray that something comes out of it ? 
Is it the leeches ?  Is it something else ? 
Immunization , that ' s the cheapest way to save a child ' s life.
The technology is there , the infrastructure is there , and yet it doesn ' t happen.
In fact , that is the leading cause of under-five mortality.
And , not only do they protect the people who sleep under them , but they have these great contagion benefits.
 " Not so fast, "  say other people.
Do you give the nets for free to maximize coverage , or do you make people pay in order to make sure that they really value them ? 
But how do you do that ? 
So here is the thing.
And in the 20th century , randomized , controlled trials have revolutionized medicine by allowing us to distinguish between drugs that work and drugs that don ' t work.
And I ' ll give you some examples with those three questions.
That ' s bad , but there are places like that.
So what is the problem ? 
But maybe there is another problem as well.
And maybe when you get there , what you find is this : The subcenter is closed . Ao you have to come back , and you are so busy and you have so many other things to do , you will always tend to postpone and postpone , and eventually it gets too late.
So let ' s try them.
In the red dots , we made it easy and gave people a reason to act now.
Now , a kilo of lentils is tiny.
Well , beforehand , everything is the same.
That ' s not bad , that ' s a good improvement.
Now , you might say ,  " Well , but it ' s not sustainable.
How about bed nets ? 
The second one is : If I give bed nets for free , are people going to use them ? 
It ' s more ideological than practical , but it turns out it ' s an easy question.
And this one that was in Kenya , they went around and distributed to people vouchers , discount vouchers.
So , how about the purchasing ? 
Well , the good news is , people , if they have the bed nets , will use the bed nets regardless of how they got it.
In the long term , people who got the free bed nets , one year later , were offered the option to purchase a bed net at two dollars.
So , that ' s for bed nets . So you will think ,  " That ' s great.
So suppose your goal is to get kids into school.
So , is that sufficient ?  If we think they should work intuitively , should we go for them ? 
And then canals were built , and with the same horseman and the same horse , you could carry ten times as much cargo.
In technology , we spend so much time experimenting , fine-tuning , getting the absolute cheapest way to do something , so why aren ' t we doing that with social policy ? 
Now I ' m going to show you what we get with various education interventions.
And here are the most surprising results.
And for every hundred dollars , you get almost 30 extra years of education.
And I cut it into smaller questions , and I have the answer to these smaller questions.
And the response of the world was great : Two billion dollars got pledged just last month , so that ' s about 10,000 dollars per death.
So , why is that ? 
So , first , it ' s mostly invisible ; second , it ' s huge ; and third , we don ' t know whether we are doing the right thing.
But look what we just did today.
So we cannot eradicate poverty just yet , but we can get started.
Worms have a little bit of a problem grabbing the headlines.
So this evidence is powerful.
It ' s a very slow process.
These economics I ' m proposing , it ' s like 20th century medicine.
I cannot tell you whether the aid we have spent in the past has made a difference , but can we come back here in 30 years and say ,  " What we have done , it really prompted a change for the better. " 
Africa,business,entrepreneur,global issues,investment
Because this is where it all really began , isn ' t it ? 
Fantastic tales , anecdotes from speakers.
I actually want answers from you.
More.
That ' s enough.
A part of my talk is going to be about investment opportunities that exist on this continent , to separate the rhetoric from the reality , the fact from the fiction.
And turnarounds are part and parcel of what I have focused on for most of my professional career.
It all began with a fantastic phone call.
Because Nelson Mandela , as he took over power as the first democratically-elected president of South Africa , faced a situation of a country that could have slid into the abyss of chaos.
And why I tell you this story is because later , when I was interviewed on SABC Africa , on a pan-African broadcast , they asked ,  " What is your key lesson , or the key thing you enjoy the most ?  "  -- because it was a huge privilege to be part of such a project.
And that has to do with me because in 1994 , I packed a few things into a backpack and headed off for a year of travel in the middle of my university career.
I went to the Siwa Oasis . That was one of my stops.
And myth says that he had an audience with the oracle , and it foretold his destiny of greatness.
With no natural light source , Siva is one of these amazing places that when you look up you see a perfect tapestry.
A satellite picture looking down at the earth.
And then I saw it -- Africa . Quite literally the  " Dark Continent. " 
It was George Kimble , the geographer , who said that ,  " The only thing dark about Africa is our ignorance of it. " 
It also is the second most populated continent , with 900 million people.
What does the data say ? 
And let ' s start at the high level , on the macro-factors.
Zambia : from 2004 to 2006 , moves from the 18 percent in inflation to the nine percent.
But that ' s just part of the story . You have a similar trend with currencies -- currencies going through an extreme time of stability.
So the very definition -- to say  " invest in Africa "  is a no-go.
But opportunities , boy oh boy , they exist.
And I ' m very proud and happy to be in that role because it is a fascinating position to be in.
For example , South Africa was recently voted as the top destination for the top 1,000 UK companies for offshore call-centers.
But what were they there for ?  To acquire assets.
But the story of Africa , and my focus , is beyond South Africa because there ' s so much happening.
The new report ,  " The Next Eleven, "  highlights that by 2020 Nigeria is going to be amongst the top 10 economies in the world.
What ' s going on in Nigeria ?  A couple of things.
But the first Eurobond , the raising of international capital offshore , off its own balance sheet , without any sovereign backing -- that is an indication of the confidence that is taking place in that economy.
It ' s an important strategic partner.
And Emeka and I have had these discussions.
So let ' s unpack those very quickly , and I ' m going to move through these very , very , very fast because I can see that clock counting down.
Close to the Mediterranean , near Alexandria -- textiles , petrochemicals.
What ' s going on there ? 
Again , opportunity to tackle markets to get that higher price.
They ' re going to be tapping into carbon credits.
The largest population in Africa is in Nigeria.
Now let ' s look at the continent as a whole.
In general , more than 50 percent of roads are untarred.
If I had to ask you ,  " In 2005 what was the best performing stock market or stock exchange in the world ?  "  Would Egypt come to mind ? 
South Africa : in the 20 percents . High ones.
And global capital is agnostic -- it has no loyalties.
10 years ago there , were very few countries that received sovereign ratings from the Standard & Poors , Moody ' s and Fitch ' s.
Some other figures . South Africa : triple B-plus . Botswana : A-plus.
So one of the big bellwethers , and one of my final points I want to mention , is the interesting thing I read is that CNBC has launched their first African channel . Why is CNBC doing this ? 
So that ' s the change that ' s coming down the pipeline.
And think about the concept of transformation in the back of your mind because things can be turned around rather quickly.
So the next step , over the next four days , is us exploring more of these ideas.
arts,creativity,culture,entertainment,film,history
It changes what we see . It changes what we remember.
So this is the footage that I was showing everybody.
They had all kinds of things . Shots were combined , and I was just really curious , I mean , what the hell were you looking at just a few minutes ago and how come , how ' d you come up with this sort of description ? 
So literally what you ' re seeing now is the confluence of a bunch of different people , a bunch of different memories , including my own , of taking a little bit of liberty with the subject matter.
It ' s good to see you again.
And that ' s simply what I did.
I don ' t know why , but they thought they did.
Okay.
You would never , ever design a rocket like that. " 
And then I did kind of get the reaction I was hoping for.
He remembered that was a perfectly safe sort of gantry system , perfectly safe rocket launch , because he ' s sitting in a rocket that has , like , a hundred thousand pounds of thrust , built by the lowest bidder.
Ron Howard : Buzz Aldrin came up to me and said ,  " Hey , that launch footage , I saw some shots I ' d never seen before . Did you guys , what vault did you find that stuff in ?  "  And I said ,  " Well , no vault , Buzz , we generated all that from scratch. " 
Jim Cameron actually photographed the real Titanic.
So I ' m going to just let it run , so you kind of absorb this sort of thing , and I ' ll describe my sort of reactions when I was looking at it for the very first time.
And I ' ll show you , you know , another thing that I found interesting is what we really were emoting to when you take a look at it.
And so , but what you ' re emoting to , or what you ' re looking at , had the same feeling , the same haunting quality , that Jim ' s footage had , so I found it so fascinating that our brains sort of , once you believe something ' s real , you transfer everything that you feel about it , this quality you have , and it ' s totally artificial.
And when Jim shot it , it was only one sub , because he was photographing from the other , and I don ' t remember if I did this or Jim did this.
And what I was hoping for is that it just melts in front of you.
And so I ' ll just show it one more time.
It was a long film to work on.
So let me show you the scene , and then I basically used the trick that was identified by Sergei Eisenstein , which is , if you have a camera that ' s moving with a moving object , what is not moving appears to be moving , and what is moving appears to be stopped , so what you ' re actually seeing now is the train is not moving at all , and what is actually moving is the floor.
 " And the thing without the wheels , that moves. " 
He was the master of his universe , and we wanted Hugo to feel the same way , so we created this shot.
It ' s actually five separate sets shot at five different times with two different boys.
So I was kind of proud of it , and I went to a friend of mine , and said ,  " You know , this is , you know , kind of the best-reviewed shot I ' ve ever worked on.

Keith Barry does brain magic
Now , I ' m going to show you all how easy it is to manipulate the human mind once you know how.
OK , reverse your hands.
OK , now , cross your hands over , so your right hand goes over , interlace your fingers like this , then make sure your right thumb is outside your left thumb -- that ' s very important.
OK , now , if you did not allow me to deceive your minds , you would all be able to do this.
She could also read the serial numbers on bills when they were placed , face down , on a hard surface.
And it ' s just a really weird thing to try and figure out.
I ' m going to guide you into the car.
Now , Kathryn , there was no way you could see through that blindfold , at all , through all that.
KB : There ' s no way you could have seen through it , agreed ? 
Go ahead and take it off , you ' re OK . We ' ll just stop for a second.
KT : No.
KB : Are you ready ? 
KT : There ' s a wall , there ' s a wall.
KT : No , no , no , no.
I ' m not taking my eyes off the road.
KT : Look at the road -- Still got that goddamn blindfold on.
We ' re OK , though ? 
KT : That is weird.
By the way , two days ago , we were going to film this down there , at the race course , and we got a guy into a car , and we got a camera man in the back , but halfway through the drive , he told me he had a -- I think it was a nine-millimeter or something , stuck to his leg.
Now , most people here would automatically say no . OK , but I want you to realize some facts.
So , I want you to just think about it for a moment.
If , for instance , I didn ' t want you to look at my right hand , well , then , I don ' t look at it.
Can you come up ? 
OK , give them a round of applause as they come up.
OK , would you mind just standing over here for a moment ? 
KB : OK , oh . Tell them -- actually here ' s the thing , answer it , answer it , answer it.
I ' ll tell you what , swap over positions.
A little bit closer.
Nicole : No.
I want you to just stand exactly like this for me , pull up your sleeves , if you don ' t mind.
Yes or no , did you feel anything ? 
KB : How many times did you feel it ? 
OK , keep it there.
Nicole : Three -- KB : Like a tickling sensation ? 
I never touched you.
You just take a seat over here for a second.
Man : OK.
Close your eyes right now.
That ' s it , all the way down , all the way down , all the way down , and further , and further , and further , and further , and further and further.
OK , now , in a moment , you ' ll feel a certain pressure , OK , and I want you to be aware of the pressure.
Do you understand ? 
OK , that was wonderfully done . Let ' s try it again.
OK , just stand , stage forward.
You can wait as long as you want , but only when you want the pressure released.
Only when you want the pressure released , we ' ll try it again.
You can wait as long as you want.
Most people ask you ,  " What the hell just happened up here ?  " 
I once saw a film called  " The Gods Are Crazy. " 
It ' s nearly impossible to break a Coke bottle.
You see , psychokinesis is the paranormal influence of the mind on physical events and processes.
We ' re going to try an experiment in psychokinesis , right now.
Make sure it is solid , there ' s only one hole , and it ' s a normal Coke bottle.
OK , I want you to pinch right here with two fingers and your thumb.
Be careful , because it is sharp . Just hold on to it for a moment.
But I want you to take this very seriously.
I ' m trying to be good here.
Imagine his name and imagine him inside the glass.
Have you got his name ? 
You didn ' t react to that , so it ' s four letters in the title.
See the way I knew that , because my name starts with a K also , but his name doesn ' t start with a K , it starts with an M.
KB : OK , give her a round of applause.
Chris Anderson : Oh , OK.
CA : You knew!
They just , they insist that because I was a magician , put a nice , black tablecloth on.
Now , they ' re all the exact same except this one obviously has a stainless steel spike sticking out of it.
KB : OK . Now , Steve , I ' m going to stand in front of the table , OK . When I stand in front of the table , I want you to put the cups on the plinths , like this , in any order you want , and then mix them all up , so nobody has any idea where the spike is , all right ? 
OK , and tell me when you ' re done.
So , all right , we ' ll leave them like that.
They ' ll keep an eye on me to make sure I don ' t do anything funny.
Now , is there any way to see through this blindfold ? 
KB : No ? 
Don ' t stack them up , OK.
Give them an extra mix up.
Tell me when you ' re done.
Tell me when I ' m over a cup.
KB : Now , Steve , do you think it ' s here ?  Yes or no ? 
KB : No ?  Good decision.
KB : Now , if I go this way , is there another cup ? 
KB : There ? 
SJ : I ' m going to say no.
Do you think the spike is under your left hand , or under your right hand ? 
SJ : I think it ' s under my right hand.
Have a look.
What drives our desire to behave morally ?  Neuroeconomist Paul Zak shows why he believes oxytocin is responsible for trust , empathy and other feelings that help build a stable society.
Is there anything unique about human beings ? 
We need to know why people are doing what they ' re doing.
I saw that people who were religious and non-religious were equally obsessed with morality.
I want to know if there was a moral molecule.
It ' s called oxytocin.
So I had this idea that oxytocin might be the moral molecule.
It can ' t be that important. " 
But it was testably stupid.
Baseline levels are near zero , without some stimulus to cause its release.
Now luckily , oxytocin is produced both in the brain and in the blood , so I could do this experiment without learning neurosurgery.
I studied one single virtue : trustworthiness.
So if I understood the chemistry of trustworthiness , I might help alleviate poverty.
If you ' re so virtuous , show me the money.
They all get $10 if they agree to show up.
The trick is you can ' t see them , you can ' t talk to them.
And they get a message by computer saying person one sent you this amount of money.
Some mad scientist is going to jab your arm with a needle and take four tubes of blood.
So in fact , experimental economists had run this test around the world , and for much higher stakes , and the consensus view was that the measure from the first person to the second was a measure of trust , and the transfer from the second person back to the first measured trustworthiness.
We found 90 percent of the first decision-makers sent money , and of those who received money , 95 percent returned some of it.
But wait . What ' s wrong with this experiment ? 
But the second is that I still only had this indirect relationship between oxytocin and trustworthiness.
And I found I could do it with a nasal inhaler.
We showed that oxytocin infusion increases generosity in unilateral monetary transfers by 80 percent.
Yes , my mom was happy about that last one.
To investigate this question , we ran an experiment where we had people watch a video of a father and his four year-old son , and his son has terminal brain cancer.
It ' s empathy that makes us help other people.
In this book , Smith argued that we are moral creatures , not because of a top-down reason , but for a bottom-up reason.
If I do something that makes you happy , I get to share your joy.
I just found the molecule behind it.
I ' m working at a gas station on the outskirts of Santa Barbara , California.
And he said ,  " Hey , I was in the men ' s room.
We have to find the owner for this. "  I said ,  " Yea. " 
 " Hey , a guy just found it. " 
Great , so I tell the guy ,  " Look , relax.
Again he asked me ,  " What do you think we should do ?  " 
I ' ll give you the jewelry , you give me a hundred dollars , and when the guy comes .. .  "  You see it . I was conned.
The victim ' s brain releases oxytocin , and you ' re opening up your wallet or purse , giving away the money.
If there ' s money on the table , they keep it all.
They have many of the attributes of psychopaths.
You need enough nurturing for this system to develop properly.
So we , in experiments , have administered testosterone to men.
We have oxytocin that connects us to others , makes us feel what they feel.
It ' s all inside of us.
So last summer , I attended a wedding in Southern England.
And I took out a centrifuge and dry ice and needles and tubes.
Who is the center of the wedding solar system ? 
Her mother , that ' s right.
Why ?  Because we need them to be successful at reproducing to perpetuate the species.
And there are so many ways we can connect to people.
So I ran this experiment recently for the Korean Broadcasting System.
So he was using social media in private.
There you go . That ' s connection.
These are the most primitive people in the world.
And it ' s so easy to cause people ' s brains to release oxytocin.
There you go.
And they ' re happier because they have better relationships of all types.
Thank you.

I tried to look at where did the kind of learning we do in schools , where did it come from ? 
What they did was amazing.
In order to have that machine running , you need lots and lots of people.
They must know three things : They must have good handwriting , because the data is handwritten ; they must be able to read ; and they must be able to do multiplication , division , addition and subtraction in their head.
The empire is gone , so what are we doing with that design that produces these identical people , and what are we going to do next if we ever are going to do anything else with it ? 
It ' s quite fashionable to say that the education system ' s broken.
Well , the clerks are the computers.
They don ' t need to be able to multiply numbers in their heads.
We know that people will work from wherever they want , whenever they want , in whatever way they want.
And right next to where I used to work , there was a slum.
And my daughter -- oh , surely she is extra-intelligent. " 
The children came running in.
I said ,  " Just like that. " 
So I said ,  " Well that ' s impossible , because -- How is it possible ?  They don ' t know anything. " 
So I repeated the experiment . I went 300 miles out of Delhi into a really remote village where the chances of a passing software development engineer was very little.
So I said ,  " How on Earth do you know all this ?  " 
Here ' s a short glimpse from those years.
And he ' s teaching her how to browse.
So I started publishing.
I started experimenting with other subjects , among them , for example , pronunciation.
Computer : Nice to meet you . Child : Nice to meet you.
Where does it stop ? 
And I said , I ' ll measure them . They ' ll get a zero.
I put in Hole in the Wall computers there , downloaded all kinds of stuff from the Internet about DNA replication , most of which I didn ' t understand.
So by now , I had developed a new pedagogical method , so I applied that . I said ,  " I haven ' t the foggiest idea. " 
I came back after two months and the children trooped in and said ,  " We ' ve understood nothing. " 
We look at it every single day. " 
I got an educational impossibility , zero to 30 percent in two months in the tropical heat with a computer under the tree in a language they didn ' t know doing something that ' s a decade ahead of their time.
I couldn ' t find a teacher . What I did find was a friend that they had , a 22-year-old girl who was an accountant and she played with them all the time.
I said ,  " I ' ll tell you what . Use the method of the grandmother. " 
What ' s the next page ?  Gosh , when I was your age , I could have never done that. '  You know what grannies do. " 
When I saw that graph I knew there is a way to level the playing field.
At 12.
What will it be tomorrow ? 
But that ' s terrible . We are homo sapiens.
It took us only 10,000 to make knowing obsolete.
If you look at Kuppam , if you look at all of the experiments that I did , it was simply saying ,  " Wow, "  saluting learning.
We take our children , we make them shut their brains down , and then we say ,  " Perform. " 
When you ' re standing in a trench all alone , if you could have survived , you ' re okay , you ' ve passed.
We need to shift that balance back from threat to pleasure.
I know more British grandmothers than anyone in the universe.
She goes on over Skype and she sorts things out.
Okay ? 
Children : You can ' t catch me.
I think what we need to look at is we need to look at learning as the product of educational self-organization.
The teacher sets the process in motion and then she stands back in awe and watches as learning happens.
They are basically broadband , collaboration and encouragement put together.
I said ,  " You won ' t believe the children who told me and where they ' re from. " 
Girl : The total of electrons is not equal to the total number of protons -- SM : Australia Girl : -- giving it a net positive of negative electrical charge.
You already heard about that . You know what that means.
But that ' s not sexy enough.
So here are a couple of images from SOLEs.
The teacher only raises the question , and then stands back and admires the answer.
So we need to design a future for learning.
It will be called the School in the Cloud.
There ' s only one granny who manages health and safety.
You can do Self-Organized Learning Environments at home , in the school , outside of school , in clubs.
And just one last thing.
And I said to her ,  " You know , I want to give a computer to everybody , every child.
I think it was good advice.
Thank you very much . Wow.
218
I ' ll play at these rock shows , be on stage standing completely still , and they ' re like ,  " What ' s she doing ? ! What ' s she doing ? ! " 
See , the closer I get to this antenna , the higher the note gets -- -- and you can get it really low.
And it ' s like a funny sound effect that follows you around if you don ' t turn the thing off.
And .. . Well , I guess I could tell you a little of the history of the theremin.
And a lot of times , even kids nowadays , they ' ll make reference to a theremin by going ,  " Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, "  because in the  ' 50s it was used in the sci-fi horror movies , that sound that ' s like ...
You have to stay so still if you want to have the most control.
I think of it almost like like a yoga instrument because it makes you so aware of every little crazy thing your body is doing , or just aware of what you don ' t want it to be doing while you ' re playing ; you don ' t want to have any sudden movements.
it ' s similar to being a vocalist , except instead of it coming out of your throat , you ' re controlling it just in the air and you don ' t really have a point of reference ; you ' re always relying on your ears and adjusting constantly.
http://www.ted.com/talks/evelyn_glennie_shows_how_to_listen.html
Evelyn Glennie shows how to listen
Of course , my job is all about listening , and my aim , really , is to teach the world to listen.
And , you know , we open it up and I read the music.
And so therefore , because time is short , if I just play you literally the first maybe two lines or so . It ' s very straightforward.
I ' m being told which part of the stick to use.
So therefore , if I translate this piece of music , we have this idea.
But it ' s the things that you notice when you ' re not actually with your instrument that in fact become so interesting , and that you want to explore through this tiny , tiny surface of a drum.
I see that you ' re clutching a teddy bear , etc. , etc.
Just the basic feeling.
If I play , for example , holding the stick -- where literally I do not let go of the stick -- you ' ll experience quite a lot of shock coming up through the arm.
And I just feel , at last , one with the stick and one with the drum.
If , for example , I play just a few bars of a piece of music for which I think of myself as a technician -- that is , someone who is basically a percussion player ...
And I said ,  " Yes , I agree with that . So what ' s the problem ?  " 
And I said ,  " Well , I think I do too -- but I also hear it through my hands , through my arms , cheekbones , my scalp , my tummy , my chest , my legs and so on. " 
can be felt with just the tiniest part of your finger , there.
They ' re all different.
And I just couldn ' t quite accept that.
No circumstances at all were used to refuse any entry.
The interesting thing about this as well , though -- -- is quite simply that not only were people connected with sound -- which is basically all of us , and we well know that music really is our daily medicine.
I have the sound coming this way.
Every single one of us , depending on where we ' re sitting , will experience this sound quite , quite differently.
But yet , we get the sensation of something happening.
So there ' s always , always that huge -- I mean , just this kaleidoscope of things to draw from.
It may be that in other halls , they ' re simply not going to experience that at all and so therefore , my level of soft , gentle playing may have to be ...
May be great there , but terrible up there.
And this is quite interesting.
If we see someone in a wheelchair , we assume they cannot walk.
Those are hugely important aspects to think about.
And you know , I just find that I have to give those pieces of music real time.
If I asked you to clap -- maybe I can do this.
And please try to create that through your clapping . Try . Just -- please try.
Try again . Snow.
Now -- great imagination , thank you very much.
Not a single one of you thought about clapping in a slightly different way other than sitting in your seats there and using two hands.
Listen , listen , listen . Now -- what can we do with thunder ? 
So , heavens! What was I to do ?  I no longer required the sticks ; I wasn ' t allowed to have these sticks.
And of course , I returned with all sorts of bruises and things like that -- but nevertheless , it was such an unbelievable experience , because then , where on Earth are you going to experience that in a piece of music ? 
Like that . And then we get a little faster and a little faster and a little faster.
And interestingly , the older I became , and when I became a full-time student at a so called  " music institution, "  all of that went out of the window.
 " Well , how ?  Why do I need to learn that ?  I need to relate it to a piece of music.
I need to have the reason , and the reason has to be by saying something through the music. " 
Because that then determines what and how we listen to certain things.
The performer is in the worst possible position for the actual sound , because they ' re hearing the contact of the stick on the drum , or the mallet on the bit of wood , or the bow on the string , etc. , or the breath that ' s creating the sound from wind and brass.
But I hope maybe we can share one or two things as the day progresses.
Internet,activism,collaboration,computers,culture,government,law,meme,web
These kids on the Internet , they have this group of kids and they like to say funny words like  " barrel roll. " 
I got to tell you , it ' s driving me nuts , actually.
That format of forum , at that time , was not well-known outside of Japan.
This is what it looks like.
And that ' s led to this discussion that ' s completely raw , completely unfiltered.
And Rick Astley ' s kind of rebirth these past two years ...
There are thousands of memes that come out of the site.
And so they ' ve come up with their own set of rules , the  " Rules of the Internet. " 
And this one ' s kind of interesting :  " If it exists , there is porn of it . No exceptions. " 
It is where a third of all the traffic is going.
And so they placed me on it , and the Internet got wind of it . My community decided they wanted me to win it.
And I ended up on top.
The amount of time and effort that went into that is absolutely incredible.
They got it taken offline and managed to piss off part of the Internet.
And last , I ' m going to show you the example , the story of Dusty the cat.
So what they did is they -- I mean , they put CSI to shame here -- the Internet detectives came out.
And so , what I think is really intriguing about a community like 4chan is just that it ' s this open place.
We ' re moving towards persistent identity.
Got a couple questions for you.
Don ' t tell.
And I ' m just curious whether you sometimes lie awake in the night worrying that you ' ve opened Pandora ' s box.
But I think that the greater good is being served here by just allowing people -- there are very few places , now , where you can go and not have identity , to be completely anonymous and say whatever you ' d like.
When I get emails , people say ,  " Thank you for giving me this place , this outlet , where I can come after work and be myself. " 
But -- CA : Tell me about what -- I mean , I think you asked the board what you might say at TED , right ? 
99 percent of it is just , would have been , you know , bleeped out.
CP : Cats and dogs were mentioned too.
It went up to about 16,000 posts , and now it has been taken off.
You ' ve got this surprising semi-underground influence , but it ' s not making you a lot of money , yet.
I mean , obviously , it ' s got some very offensive , obscene content on it , just in terms of language alone.
CA : That ' s very cool.
The content is not dinner table conversation in the least.
CA : And so , in 10 years '  time , what do you picture yourself doing ? 
http://www.ted.com/talks/paul_sereno_digs_up_dinosaurs.html
Paul Sereno digs up dinosaurs
So even before that impact was known , even before scientists in general came to an agreement over the theory of evolution , scientists and natural historians of all kinds of stripes actually had divided Earth ' s life ' s history into these two episodes : Mesozoic , the middle life , and the Cenozoic , the recent life.
The work immediately begs the question ,  " Why didn ' t they go into the waters ?  " 
Why didn ' t they hang around in trees at good size , and why didn ' t they burrow ? 
In fact , I think that most of it has to do with body size -- the size you are when you inherit a vacant ecospace from whatever natural disaster.
You want to measure it by the time it took to reach maximum body size ? 
So there ' s lessons to learn , and there ' s lessons to learn from the exception , the exception that we know very well today from the discoveries we ' ve made , and many other scholars have made around the world.
There ' s burrowing birds.
It is the greatest transition that we have , actually , on land from one habitat to another , bar none , to understand how a bony , fairly heavy , kilogram or a couple-of-kilogram animal could make such a transition.
I ' d like to call for this little video clip to give you some idea of , sort of , what we face . Normally , we get asked a lot of questions :  " Well , how do you find fossils in areas that look like this ?  " 
At the bottom of the cliff , we find that they ' re rare as hens '  teeth.
You ' ve got to dig a hole that ' s usually quite a bit bigger than that to get it out ; you ' ve got to climb those cliffs and find , really , everything that existed -- not just the dinosaurs , but the entire story . If you ' re lucky , and you dig a place like that , you actually find the ash bed to dig it , and we did.
This is sort of a look at the skull , and it ' s an absolutely fantastic thing about five or six inches long.
That ' s where dinosaurs began . That ' s where the radiation began.
Most of those missing puzzle pieces are southern continents , because it was those continents that are least explored.
There ' s no roads into the Sahara . It ' s an enormous place.
And you really have to be able to withstand conditions -- you have to drive into the desert , you will see landscapes in many cases -- you can see from what we ' ve discovered -- that nobody else has ever seen.
Some of them are more experienced.
So , you can ' t leave your normal metal tools out because you ' ll get a first-degree burn if you grab them sometimes.
Your job is to excavate things like this in the foreground , and make them enter the pages of history.
You transported the bones out yourself to the coast of Africa , onto a boat , if you wanted to get them out of the middle of the Sahara.
It looks nothing like what we would find if we dug in contemporary beds in North America.
It is an incredible view of life , and it really began when we began to understand the depth of time.
Here ' s some others.
This was the cover of Science , because they thought that humans were more intelligent than these animals , but we can see by some in our administration that despite the enormous advantage in brain volume some of the attitudes remain the same . Anyway , smaller raptors.
It ' s really a wholly separate radiation.
And huge things -- I mean , this is a lower jaw just laying there in the desert of this enormous crocodile.
We had to actually look at recent crocodiles to understand how crocodiles scale.
Narrator : .. . as long as their boat.
Narrator : It falls to Paul to cover its eyes.
I ' ve got it . I ' ve got the back legs.
Sixty-five . Wow.
Man : I knew it was big.
Narrator : Paul has never seen a fossil do that.
So -- there were -- Well , you know , the -- the fossil record is truly amazing because it really forces you to look at living animals in a new way.
I ' m going to lead an expedition to the Sahara to dig up Africa ' s largest neolithic site.
An amazing record of the colonization of the Sahara 5,000 years ago is been sitting out there waiting for us to go back . So , really exciting.
It was a precursor to India , a messenger from Gondwana -- a lost paradise of dinosaurs isolated for millions of years.
I ' ve talked about a few of them . We really need to take that further.
These are all landlubbing animals . There ' s a couple of choices.
And so , in addition to digging , I think we have some answers from the dinosaur record . I think these dinosaurs migrated -- we call it dispersal -- around the globe , with the slightest land bridge.
We have downgraded this factor.
I want to give you three dimensions.
This is a computer program which has three knobs.
I was one of those . I was failed by my school -- my school failed me.
I was a total failure in school , not really headed to graduate high school.
It became abstract.
I took a side trip to the American Museum , and I never recovered.
I give you a human face because you ' re experts at that.
We all know , and there ' s been several allusions to it , that we are failing in our ability to produce enough scientists , engineers and technicians.
Those are the questions I ask . And we talk about Ethiopia , and it ' s very important.
Give us a museum of dinosaurs , and we will attract tourists , which is our number two industry.
We ' ve started in Chicago an organization -- a non-profit organization -- called Project Exploration.
And we created a track record.
It ' s gone through science as an inquiry , which was a big advance , and Dewey back at Chicago -- you learn by doing.
It ' s hard to get them to envision themselves as a scientist , which involves standing up in front of people like we ' re doing here at this symposium and presenting something as a knowledgeable person , and then seeing yourself in the role as a scientist and giving yourself the tools to pursue that.
http://www.ted.com/talks/christopher_mcdougall_are_we_born_to_run.html
Christopher McDougall : Are we born to run ? 
Case in point : A couple months ago , if you saw the New York City Marathon , I guarantee you , you saw something that no one has ever seen before.
Except -- bad news for Derartu Tulu -- some other people had the same idea , including the Olympic gold medalist and Paula Radcliffe , who is a monster , the fastest woman marathoner in history by far.
She ' s under the underdogs.
So we all know what to do in this situation , right ? 
So Paula Radcliffe , unfortunately , does it.
And Paula Radcliffe at that point says ,  " I ' m done . Go. " 
It ' s a heartwarming story , but if you drill a little bit deeper , you ' ve got to sort of wonder about what exactly was going on there.
Someone with that kind of heart , there ' s some kind of connection there.
When the conquistadors arrived in North America you had two choices : you either fight back and engage or you could take off.
The second thing remarkable about the Tarahumara is , deep into old age -- 70 to 80 years old -- these guys aren ' t running marathons ; they ' re running mega-marathons.
So what ' s the connection ? 
And once again , a mystery wrapped inside of a mystery -- perhaps the key to Derartu Tulu and the Tarahumara is wrapped in three other mysteries , which go like this : three things -- if you have the answer , come up and take the microphone , because nobody else knows the answer.
Suddenly humans show up -- Homo erectus -- big , old melon-head.
So , somehow , for nearly two million years , we are killing animals without any weapons.
We ' re not fast.
There ' s not a fast woman on the planet and there never has been.
But you get to the marathon we were just talking about -- you guys have only been allowed to run the marathon for 20 years.
The uterus would fall out , literally fall out of the body.
Then you go beyond 26 miles , into the distance that medical science also told us would be fatal to humans -- remember Pheidippides died when he ran 26 miles -- you get to 50 and 100 miles , and suddenly it ' s a different game.
They give you 48 hours to finish this race.
And what they found is that , if you start running the marathon at age 19 , you will get progressively faster , year by year , until you reach your peak at age 27.
You would think it might take eight years to go back to the same speed , maybe 10 years -- no , it ' s 45 years.
Is there one piece in the puzzle which might wrap all these things up ? 
Maybe we evolved as a hunting pack animal.
But the advantage of that little bit of social discomfort is the fact that , when it comes to running under hot heat for long distances , we ' re superb , we ' re the best on the planet.
What if the only natural advantage we had in the world was the fact that we could get together as a group , go out there on that African Savannah , pick out an antelope and go out as a pack and run that thing to death ? 
The key to being part of a hunting pack is the word  " pack. " 
The herd explodes and it gathers back again.
It makes no sense to have the antelope over there dead and the people who want to eat it 50 miles away.
Another thing that has to be true about this pack : this pack cannot be really materialistic.
The pack has got to be able to swallow its ego , be cooperative and pull together.
But maybe it ' s something different.
We try to can it and package it and make it  " better "  and sell it to people.
You talk to a runner , I guarantee , within 30 seconds , the conversation turns to injury.
It ' s only in our lifetime that running has become associated with fear and pain.
I didn ' t do yoga . I ' m not ready. " 
So how do we get back to that again ? 
If you do 3:59:59 , you ' re awesome , because you qualified for another race.
But maybe there ' s another benefit there as well.
And if we find that thing , maybe there is a big fat Nobel Prize out there.
And what you find is something the Tarahumara have known for a very long time , that this can be a whole lot of fun.
And I appreciate you guys listening to this story . Thanks very much.

I knew robots like that didn ' t really exist , but I knew I wanted to build them.
But one really struck me.
Three years later -- a lot of programming , working with other graduate students in the lab -- Kismet was ready to start interacting with people.
I almost lost it this week.
So over the past several years I ' ve been continuing to explore this interpersonal dimension of robots , now at the media lab with my own team of incredibly talented students.
This is Matt Berlin interacting with Leo , introducing Leo to a new object.
Leo , this is Cookie Monster.
Cookie Monster is very , very bad.
So what I ' ve learned through building these systems is that robots are actually a really intriguing social technology , where it ' s actually their ability to push our social buttons and to interact with us like a partner that is a core part of their functionality.
People use these cues to determine things like how persuasive someone is , how likable , how engaging , how trustworthy.
Mimicry ' s believed to play a role , but how ? 
But with the robot , you can.
And the bottom line is -- the reason why this works is because it turns out people just behave like people even when interacting with a robot.
You call your friend , she puts her handset in a robot , and , bam! You ' re a MeBot -- you can make eye contact , you can talk with your friends , you can move around , you can gesture -- maybe the next best thing to really being there , or is it ? 
The first was just the screen.
And then the fully expressive MeBot.
We looked at their desire to cooperate.
So it seems like this physical , social embodiment actually really makes a difference.
But my parents live thousands of miles away , so they just don ' t get to see each other that often.
And as grandma-bot , she can now play , really play , with my sons , with her grandsons , in the real world with his real toys.
So in the United States today , over 65 percent of people are either overweight or obese , and now it ' s a big problem with our children as well.
So we actually explored this idea in our lab.
It had a couple of simple non-verbal skills it could do.
And then it could help track that for you.
So an interesting question is , does the social embodiment really matter ?  Does it matter that it ' s a robot ? 
Another was a computer that ran the same touch-screen interface , ran exactly the same dialogues.
Because the challenge is not losing weight , it ' s actually keeping it off.
When it asked people to rate it on terms of the quality of the working alliance , people rated the robot higher and they trusted the robot more.
And even when we would come up to pick up the robots at the end of the study , they would come out to the car and say good-bye to the robots.
My sons , they love the screen . They love the screen.
I like to think of this as the Atari Pong of this blended-reality play.
It turns out that kids love it when the character becomes real and enters into their world.
So here , Nathan has changed the letter A to the number 2.
And then finally , what I ' ve been trying to do here is create a really immersive experience for kids , where they really feel like they are part of that story , a part of that experience.
I want them to be able to literally build their imagination into these experiences and make them their own.
So this is a new project.
Robots touch something deeply human within us.
art,arts,culture,entertainment,photography
I show a number of photographs and films , but I also make television programs , books and some advertising , all with the same concept.
I was fascinated by this phenomenon , so I wondered : could one erase the image of Diana , actually quite crudely and physically ? 
and  " How did she die in the back of the car ?  "  -- and I was intrigued by this sort of mass voyeurism , so I made these rather gory images.
Was she pregnant ?  Did she want his baby ? 
So , this is an image of Diana looking at Camilla kissing her husband , and this was a sequence of images.
This is Jane Smith and Jo Bloggs , for instance , but you think it ' s Camilla and the Queen , and I ' m fascinated how what you think is real isn ' t necessarily real.
So , the photograph becomes this teaser and incites desire and voyeurism ; what you can ' t have , you want more.
watch her horses . .
Well , here is the image.
Then suddenly , it started to get on front pages.
But then this changed suddenly.
It was an April fool actually , and to this day some people think it ' s real.
How they wheedle their way into the collective psyche without us even knowing , and how that should happen.
I then continued on to make a whole body of work about Marilyn -- the biggest icon of all -- and trying to titillate by shooting through doorways and shutters and so on and so forth , and only showing certain angles to create a reality that , obviously , is completely constructed.
Then I made a book.
Because obviously it ' s making a comment about our culture right now : that we can ' t tell what ' s real.
You know , what does Tony Blair get up to in private with his fashion guru ? 
And it ' s that wish , or that desire , that I suppose I ' m dealing with in my work.
I did an advertising campaign for Schweppes , which is Coca-Cola , and so that was very interesting in terms of the legalities.
But the meanings changed in the sense that with the logo on , you ' re closing all the lines of interpretation down to selling a product and that ' s all you ' re doing.
Tony Blair and Cherie . And again , the legalities -- we had to be very careful.
So , it ' s Tony Blair reading and practicing his speech ; I ' ve got them doing yoga inside there with Carole Caplin ; Sven making out with Ulrika Jonsson , who he was having an affair with at that time.
And the press were interviewing , and I was signing my book . .
It ' s an extremely fast way of getting information.
And then you change the photograph he ' s shooting at , and it suddenly becomes rather grim and maybe less accessible . .
And really commenting , you know , based on the perception we have of the celebrities.
I ' ve also been working with The Guardian on a topical basis -- a page a week in their newspaper -- which has been very interesting , working topically.
That ' s why this image was made one year ago , and what it means today.
Dr . Ernest Madu runs the Heart Institute of the Caribbean in Kingston , Jamaica , where he proves that -- with careful design , smart technical choices , and a true desire to serve -- it ' s possible to offer world-class healthcare in the developing world.
It is interesting that in the United States , the most significant health-care budget goes to cardiovascular disease care , whether it ' s private or public.
A health status of a nation parallels development of that nation.
85 percent of global disease burden for cardiovascular disease is in developing countries -- not in the West -- and yet 90 percent of the resources are in the West.
Has anyone here wondered what will happen if you go back to your room at night , and you start getting chest pains , shortness of breath , sweating ? 
This is what ' s going on.
And those are the times they ' re most productive.
What are the risk factors ? 
20 percent are getting treated.
In eight short years -- we ' re here talking about HIV , malaria , which is all good.
This is a typical African hospital . We can ' t depend on the elites -- they go to USA , Germany , U.K . for treatment . Unbelievable.
So , they spend their money trying to fix those problems.
If they have not worked , we have to look for alternative solutions.
Everyone knows the problem . No one knows what the solutions are.
You can ' t raise money.
That is totally wrong . Those of you in the audience here , if you want to help Africa , invest money in sustainable development.
We have every modality that can be done in Vanderbilt , Cleveland Clinic -- everywhere in the U.S . -- and we do it for about 10 percent of the cost that you will need to do those things in the United States.
And I will tell you how we ' re able to do it.
Very soon we will all be dead and gone , but the problems will stay , unless we have people taking over from where we stopped.
We manufacture them in-house , ourselves . That keeps the costs down.
Technology is a great equalizer . How do we make it work ? 
We currently have three locations in the Caribbean , and we ' re planning a fourth one.
This model can be adapted to every disease process.
I ' ll lead you through , to see how this happens.
They ' ll give me that information , and we ' ll make the care of the patient better.
I ' m happy to say that the things we have implemented -- 80 percent of U.S . practices do not have them , and yet the technology is there.
And we ' ll extend it to the rural centers and make it affordable.
But , you know , you have to tell people what can be done.
We have had walks every year -- every March , April.
We encourage them to bring children.
So we are pleased with that.
They need to put resources elsewhere . But we can still do it.
And for that money -- for every one patient that has the money to pay , it gives us an opportunity to take care of at least four people that do not have the resources to pay.
And we are starting a biomedical engineering program , so that we will train people locally , who can repair that equipment.
Dr . Jason Topping : My name is Jason Topping.
There ' s been no doubt around my colleagues about the utility of the training I received here , and I think there ' s been an increased interest now in -- particularly in echocardiography and its use in our setting.
Who are we to decide that poor people cannot get the best care ? 
We will extend the same system into other areas , like dialysis treatment.
http://www.ted.com/talks/temple_grandin_the_world_needs_all_kinds_of_minds.html
Temple Grandin : The world needs all kinds of minds
You wouldn ' t have any...
And one of the things that is really going to concern me is getting these kids to be the ones that are going to invent the next energy things , you know , that Bill Gates talked about this morning.
I think in pictures , I don ' t think in language.
Well , if you ' re building a bridge , details are pretty important because it will fall down if you ignore the details.
In my work with cattle , I noticed a lot of little things that most people don ' t notice would make the cattle balk . Like , for example , this flag waving , right in front of the veterinary facility.
People thought that was crazy . A coat on a fence would make them balk , shadows would make them balk , a hose on the floor ...
And actually it ' s called  " Temple Grandin, "  not  " Thinking In Pictures. " 
I thought everybody thought in pictures.
I see only specific pictures.
OK , how about famous ones ? 
Now , visual thinking was a tremendous asset in my work designing cattle-handling facilities.
But , one of the things that I was able to do in my design work is I could actually test run a piece of equipment in my mind , just like a virtual reality computer system.
But one of the things that really worries me is : Where ' s the younger version of those kids going today ? 
Another thing that helped me as a little kid is , boy , in the  ' 50s , you were taught manners.
This is tensor imaging.
And some of the research now is showing is that people on the spectrum actually think with primary visual cortex.
Gigantic mistake : I ' m finding a lot of kids who need to skip algebra , go right to geometry and trig.
And there in the background is the pattern for folding it.
You ' ll see these different kinds of minds.
And I came in half an hour beforehand so I could have it put on and kind of get used to it , and they got it bent so it ' s not hitting my chin.
Because think about it : An animal is a sensory-based thinker , not verbal -- thinks in pictures , thinks in sounds , thinks in smells.
There ' s a ton of information on that fire hydrant.
You could have a horse that ' s been abused by a rider.
Man on a horse , a man on foot -- they ' re two different things.
When I ' m out troubleshooting equipment or problems with something in a plant , they don ' t seem to be able to figure out ,  " Do I have a training people issue ? 
Now , let ' s say I figure out it ' s an equipment problem.
Let ' s just look at something like , you know , solving problems with making airlines safer.
You know , five fatal wrecks in the last 20 years , the tail either came off or steering stuff inside the tail broke in some way.
It ' s specific . See , my thinking ' s bottom-up.
White cowboy hats , that was absolutely fine.
And this brings up the whole thing of my science teacher.
And he got me challenged to figure out an optical illusion room.
And they ' re not going down the right path.
And then you can get into the point where it ' s so severe you ' re going to have a person that ' s going to be non-verbal.
And the dementia ate out the language parts of the brain , and then this artwork came out of somebody who used to install stereos in cars.
And they ' ve taken out the autoshop class and the drafting class and the art class.
OK , my science teacher got me studying because I was a goofball that didn ' t want to study.
You know , how to have table manners at granny ' s Sunday party.
You know , all I wanted to do was draw pictures of horses when I was little.
Let ' s get him working on building different things.
In other words , use that fixation in order to motivate that kid , that ' s one of the things we need to do.
They can do graphic design , all kinds of stuff with computers , photography , industrial design.
It ' s just kind of -- you just have to learn it.
He was a NASA space scientist.
Another thing that can be very , very , very successful is there is a lot of people that may have retired from working in the software industry , and they can teach your kid.
Mentors are just essential.
You ' ve got to tell them something a lot more specific :  " Well , we ' re designing a software for a phone and it has to do some specific thing.
And I just want to thank everybody for coming.
You know , you once wrote , I like this quote ,  " If by some magic , autism had been eradicated from the face of the Earth , then men would still be socializing in front of a wood fire at the entrance to a cave. " 
But if there is someone here who has an autistic child , or knows an autistic child and feels kind of cut off from them , what advice would you give them ? 
There ' s going to be about half the people on the spectrum that are not going to learn to talk , and they ' re not going to be working Silicon Valley , that would not be a reasonable thing for them to do.
That was like , we considered that super cool.
What are you most passionate about ? 
I developed a really simple scoring system for slaughter plants where you just measure outcomes : How many cattle fell down ? 
You directly observe a few simple things.
It ' s libraries.
And server farms , or data centers are great libraries of knowledge.
Using sleight-of-hand techniques and charming storytelling , illusionist Marco Tempest brings a jaunty stick figure to life onstage at TEDGlobal.
So magic is a very introverted field.
Now my own speciality is combining digital technology and magic.
Could we bring down the lights please ?  Thank you.
Wake up.
Come on.
Okay.
Come on.
http://www.ted.com/talks/charles_elachi_on_the_mars_rovers.html
Charles Elachi on the Mars Rovers
Naturally , they blew up a shack , and Caltech , well , then , hey , you go to the Arroyo and really do all your tests in there.
So , that gives you a kind of flavor of the kind of people we have there.
I tried to come like him this morning , but as I walked out , then it was too cold , and I said , I ' d better put my shirt back on.
And I want to tell you a quote from Ralph Emerson that one of my colleagues , you know , put on my wall in my office , and it says ,  " Do not go where the path may lead.
In our early days we used to work a lot on rockets , but we also used to have a lot of parties , you know.
And that was done over a period of a couple of years , and now we are the leading organization , you know , exploring space on all of your behalf.
But then also , just to celebrate that , we started an event at JPL for  " Miss Guided Missile. " 
And that ' s what you see in the last Rose Bowl , you know , when we entered one of the floats.
But I said I ' m going to show you a short clip of one of our employees to kind of give you an idea about some of the talent that we have.
There ' s the heavy-hitting sound of rock.
Some of the most brilliant engineers I know are the ones who have that sort of artistic quality about them.
Tell them where to put it , and then just do what you want to do.
Well , the way I think about it is fairly simple.
All that started from that Big Bang . So , the question is : How did that happen ?  How did that evolve ?  How did the universe form ? 
Is there life on every planet that you can see around the stars ? 
You can skip the dust part.
And the reason Mars takes particular attention : it ' s not very far from us.
It has polar caps . It has an atmosphere somewhat thinner than ours , so it has weather . So , it ' s very similar to some extent , and you can see some of the features on it , like the Grand Canyon on Mars , or what we call the Grand Canyon on Mars.
And if you look at the height of it and you compare it to Mount Everest , you see , it ' ll give you an idea of how large that Mount Olympus , you know , is , relative to Mount Everest.
So it is a dynamic planet , and activity is going on as we speak today.
And if you look at the top left , you see a little teeny dark dot.
And we actually used the combination of the satellite images and the Rover to actually conduct science , because we can observe large areas and then you can get those Rovers to move around and basically go to a certain location.
And what these layers -- that ' s what the surface used to be a million years ago , 10 million years ago , 100 million years ago , and you get deposits on top of them.
If you were there you wouldn ' t do it yourself.
Now you say , Charles , you are really lying to us , and so on , but that ' s not true . We really believed they were going to last 90 days or 100 days , because they are solar powered , and Mars is a dusty planet , so we expected the dust would start accumulating on the surface , and after a while we wouldn ' t have enough power , you know , to keep them warm.
And now we designed them reasonably well , but that ' s exactly why they are lasting that long and still providing all the science data.
But still they are producing a lot of scientific data.
Video : Okay , we have parachute aligned.
CE : That ' s about what happened in the Houston operation room . It ' s exactly like this.
CE : Not too bad.
But one area which is particularly intriguing for us is the northern region , you know , of Mars , close to the North Pole , because we see ice caps , and we see the ice caps shrinking and expanding , so it ' s very much like you have in northern Canada.
So it ' s on May 25 around just before five o ' clock our time here on the West Coast , actually we will be landing on another planet.
So this was launched about nine months ago.
Lynn Craig : Where there tends to be water , at least on Earth , there tends to be life , and so it ' s potentially a place where life could have existed on the planet in the past.
And our lander is safely tucked inside what we call an aero-shuttle.
Rob Grover : Friction really starts to build up on the spacecraft , and we use the friction when it ' s flying through the atmosphere to our advantage to slow us down.
EB : The inside doesn ' t get very hot.
The fabric and the stitching could just pull apart.
LC : After the heat shield has been jettisoned and the legs are deployed , the next step is to have the radar system begin to detect how far Phoenix really is from the ground.
EB : Now the spacecraft actually has to decide when it ' s going to get rid of its parachute.
It ' s a very scary moment ; a lot has to happen in a very short amount of time.
And EDL itself is all over in a matter of seven minutes.
It ' s about getting a spacecraft that ' s hurtling through deep space and using all this bag of tricks to somehow figure out how to get it down to the surface of Mars at zero miles an hour.
So now let me talk about the next things that we are doing.
As you saw a little bit earlier , when we were doing the Phoenix one , we have to take into account the heat that we are going to be facing.
First we start by we want to have our employees to be as imaginative as they can.
On the right , also , we have to take into account the environment of the planet where we are going.
If we are doing entry , we have to do tests of parachutes.
Next step , we go and actually build some kind of test models and actually test them , you know , in the lab at JPL , in what we call our Mars Yard.
And this next Rover that we ' re flying is about the size of a car.
And I know many of you , kind of , last time afterwards said well , that was a cool thing to have -- those airbags.
So we came up with this ingenious idea , which is used here on Earth for helicopters.
What we are going to be doing with that Rover as it drives around , it ' s going to go and analyze the chemical composition of rocks.
It ' s real stuff.
Now ,  " The Lord of the Rings "  has two things played through it.
So , the idea is , by watching Saturn we ' re actually watching our solar system in real time being formed on a smaller scale , so it ' s like a test bed for it.
This is not animation or anything like this.
So that ' s why you have these gaps , is because a small satellite , you know , is being formed in that location.
And that ' s one of the satellites which was actually formed on that one.
One of them is called Enceladus.
So as we flew by away from it , we looked back . And guess what ? 
And somehow , through some dynamic effect , we ' re having these geysers which are being , you know , emitted from it.
And over the next few years , as we keep orbiting , you know , Saturn , we are planning to get closer and closer down to the surface and make more accurate measurements.
Now , methane gets people all excited , because it ' s organic material , so immediately people start thinking , could life have evolved in that location , when you have a lot of organic material.
We dropped a probe in the atmosphere of Titan.
And then with an instrument we have on board , a radar instrument , we found there are lakes like the Great Lakes in here , so it looks very much like Earth.
So here we have a cycle of a planet which is like our Earth , but is all made of ethane and methane and organic material.
So in closing , I said I want to close by a couple of pictures.
You barely can see ourselves . So what I did , I thought I ' d zoom on it.
At TEDxMaastricht , Daniel Kraft offers a fast-paced look at the next few years of innovations in medicine , powered by new tools , tests and apps that bring diagnostic information right to the patient ' s bedside.
A couple of years ago when I was attending the TED Conference in Long Beach , I met Harriet.
We actually share the same genealogy with Ozzie the iceman.
And when I met Harriet in person the next year at the TED Conference , she ' d gone online and ordered our own happy Haplotype T-shirts.
We often think linearly.
And many of these technologies -- speaking as a physician and innovator -- we can really start to leverage to impact the future of our own health and of health care , and to address many of the major challenges that we have in health care today , ranging from the really exponential costs to the aging population , the way we really don ' t use information very well today , the fragmentation of care and often the very difficult course of adoption of innovation.
Now my favorite technology , example of exponential technology , we all have in our pocket.
Now , I ' ve gained some insight into this.
We also have seven-day executive programs.
where you can pee on a little chip connected to your iPhone and check yourself for an STD.
Let ' s start with faster.
But where I think computational speed is most applicable is in that of imaging.
And now we can see inside of the brain with a resolution and ability that was never before available , and essentially learn how to reconstruct , and maybe even re-engineer , or backwards engineer , the brain so we can better understand pathology , disease and therapy.
And this sort of data explosion available from these is really almost becoming a challenge.
Let ' s get personal . I won ' t ask who here ' s had a colonoscopy , but if you ' re over age 50 , it ' s time for your screening colonoscopy.
Oh , we might have missed it , but using A.I . on top of radiology , we can find lesions that were missed before.
So even my stethoscope is now digital.
These are now at a price point of -- what used to be 100,000 euros or a couple of hundred-thousand dollars -- for about 5,000 dollars , I can have the power of a very powerful diagnostic device in my hand.
And now , of course , we ' re in the era of the iPad , even the iPad 2.
So I want you to imagine when in a couple of years , when we ' ve started to apply this cloud-based information , when we really have the A.I . physician and leverage our brains to connectivity to make decisions and diagnostics at a level never done.
The ability to interact with your health care provider is different.
We can actually now visit our patients robotically -- this is the RP7 ; if I ' m a hematologist , visit another clinic , visit a hospital.
You can Tweet your weight to your friends , and they can keep you in line.
This was developed by colleagues at Stanford , called the iRhythm -- completely supplants the prior technology at a much lower price point with much more effectivity.
I can get insight into that on a daily basis.
There ' s even mirrors today that can pick up your pulse rate.
Probably in a few years , you ' ll check into your mirror and it ' s going to be diagnosing you.
Now we ' ve heard a lot today about new technology and connection.
We ' re now in the era of super-enabling the surgeon who can now go inside the body and do things with robotic surgery , which is here today , at a level that was not really possible even five years ago.
A surgeon in New York can be helping a surgeon in Amsterdam , for example.
For those who have disabilities -- the paraplegic -- there ' s the era of brain-computer interface , or BCI , where chips have been put on the motor cortex of completely quadriplegic patients and they can control a curser or a wheelchair or , eventually , a robotic arm.
If you haven ' t lost a limb -- you ' ve had a stroke , for example -- you can wear these augmented limbs.
And now this is the early era of wearable robotics.
Now how about other exponentials ? 
You can swallow this completely integrated device.
On the cardiac side , pacemakers are getting smaller and much easier to place so you don ' t need to train an interventional cardiologist to place them.
Artificial retinas , the ability to put these arrays on the back of the eyeball and allow the blind to see.
BlueTooth , WiFi available -- beams back images to your eye.
We can now leverage microfluidics , like this chip made by Steve Quake at Stanford.
If we go down the small pathway a little bit farther , we ' re entering the era of nanomedicine , the ability to make devices super small to the point where we can design red blood cells or microrobots that will monitor our blood system or immune system , or even those that might clear out the clots from our arteries.
We ' re now approaching essentially a thousand-dollar genome -- probably next year to two years , probably a hundred-dollar genome.
And we enter the era of true personalized medicine -- the right drug for the right person at the right time -- instead of what we ' re doing today , which is the same drug for everybody -- sort of blockbuster drug medications , medications which don ' t work for you , the individual.
But if I take that same data , upload it to deCODEme , I can look at my risk for sample Type II diabetes.
Leveraging my knowledge of my pharmacogenomics -- how my genes modulate , what my drugs do and what doses I need are going to become increasingly important , and once in the hands of the individual and the patient , will make better drug dosing and selection available.
We can capture that information.
This has been called by Lee Hood , the father of the field , P4 medicine.
So I ' ll finish up with exponentially better.
This is a new device that is essentially doing that.
We ' ve learned at Stanford and other places that we can discover cancer stem cells , the ones that seem to be really responsible for disease relapse.
The cancer stem cells remain , and the tumor can return months or years later.
So I ' ve studied a lot about stem cells -- embryonic stem cells are particularly powerful.
Still a Phase I trial , but evolving.
It ' s now been FDA approved , and it ' ll hopefully be on the market in the next year or so.
We can now reprogram your skin cells to actually act like a pluripotent embryonic stem cell and to utilize those potentially to treat multiple organs in that same patient -- making your own personalized stem cell lines.
But I think , as integration of exponential technologies , this is the example.
But often it ' s too late and it ' s Stage III or IV cancer , for example.
Host : Thank you . Thank you.
arts,culture,entertainment,literature,poetry,society,storytelling
I was sort of astonished to find out how many I have actually.
All because of a word I said , not even said really , only repeated.
She ' d stand me in the sink to pee because there was never room in the toilet.
Dare I admit that after she did it I never really loved her again ? 
It took some diplomacy.
More than the curlers some of the women seemed constantly to have in their hair in preparation for some great event -- a ball , one would think -- that never came to pass ; more than the way most women ' s faces not only were never made up during the day , but seemed scraped , bleached , and , with their plucked eyebrows , scarily masklike ; more than all that it was those dresses that made women so unknowable and forbidding , adepts of enigmas to which men could have no access , and boys no conception.
We knew so little in those days , as little as now , I suppose about healing those hurts : even the women , in their best dresses , with beads and sequins sewn on the bodices , even in lipstick and mascara , their hair aflow , could only stand wringing their hands , begging for peace , while father and son , like thugs , like thieves , like Romans , simmered and hissed and hated , inflicting sorrows that endured , the worst anyway , through the kiss and embrace , bleeding from brother to brother , into the generations.
It actually happened right at the time we met.
Her cats , God knows how many , who must piss on her rugs -- her landing ' s a sickening reek.
It startled , then bored , then repelled me.
Gray-yellow hair , army pants under a nightgown , her turning away , hiding her ravaged face in her hands , muttering an inappropriate  " Hi. " 
Medea she was , next time I saw her.
The girl , my old love , the last lost time I saw her when she came to find me at a party , her drunkenly stumbling , falling , sprawling , skirt hiked , eyes veined red , swollen with tears , her shame , her dishonor.
Too many lives in our lives already , too many chances for sorrow , too many unaccounted-for pasts.
Her crossing the fragmented tiles , faltering at the step to the street , droning , not looking at me ,  " Can you help me ?  " 
I think I ' ll lighten up a little.
Wouldn ' t it be nice if intestinal gas came embodied in visible clouds , so she could see that her really quite inoffensive pop had only barely grazed my face before it drifted away.
Phwap! Phwap! Phwap!
Many -- most of my poems actually are urban poems . I happen to be reading a bunch that aren ' t.
Me shyly , obliquely , trying not to be furtive.
Not excrement merely , not merely surface and orifice going unwashed , rediffusion of rum , there was will in it , and intention , power and purpose -- a social , ethical rage and rebellion -- despair too , though , grief , loss.
How rich I would think , is the lexicon of our self-absolving.
Her occupancy , her absolute , faithful attendance.
A student , a young woman in a fourth-floor hallway of her lycee , perched on the ledge of an open window chatting with friends between classes ; a teacher passes and chides her ,  " Be careful , you might fall, "  almost banteringly chides her ,  " You might fall, "  and the young woman , 18 , a girl really , though she wouldn ' t think that , as brilliant as she is , first in her class , and  " Beautiful , too, "  she ' s often told , smiles back , and leans into the open window , which wouldn ' t even be open if it were winter -- if it were winter someone would have closed it -- leans into the window , farther , still smiling , farther and farther , though it takes less time than this , really an instant , and lets herself fall.
Weightfully upon me was the world.
Yes , the girl falls , absurd to fall , even the earth with its compulsion to take unto itself all that falls must know that falling is absurd , yet the girl falling isn ' t myself , or she is myself , but a self I took of my own volition unto myself.
I like to just end.
But forget her breasts.
Always that erotic murmur , I ' m hardly myself if I ' m not in a state of incipient desire.
The display was a photo . Men and women stripped naked , some trying to cover their genitals , others too frightened to bother , lined up in snow waiting to be shot and thrown into a ditch.
I kept finding myself at her page.
Sex and death , how close they can seem.
When we make love , her holding me everywhere all around me , I ' m there and not there.
And not having to know history ' s next mad rage or regression , it might be a relief.
Vamp . Siren . Seductress.
Photographs do more than document history -- they make it . At TED University , Jonathan Klein of Getty Images shows some of the most iconic , and talks about what happens when a generation sees an image so powerful it can ' t look away -- or back.
In my industry , we believe that images can change the world.
I ' d be extremely surprised if you didn ' t recognize many or most of them.
We ' re looking for something more.
We had never seen our planet from this perspective before.
This destructive power takes many different forms.
Well , I think what is far worse is man ' s destructive power over man.
The publication of those images , as opposed to the images themselves , caused a government to change its policies.
In the 1960s and 1970s , the Vietnam War was basically shown in America ' s living rooms day in , day out.
In the 1980s , the stigmatization of people with the disease was an enormous barrier to even discussing or addressing it.
Thankfully , when these photos appeared in The Guardian in 1998 , they put a lot of focus and attention and , in the end , a lot of money towards the Sudan famine relief efforts.
We all saw those images after Katrina , and I think for millions of people they had a very strong impact.
But images don ' t need to be graphic in order to remind us of the tragedy of war.
In my view , it ' s not the photographer who makes the photo , it ' s you.
Here it is.
Arctic explorer Ben Saunders recounts his harrowing solo ski trek to the North Pole , complete with engaging anecdotes , gorgeous photos and never-before-seen video.
This is me . My name is Ben Saunders.
More than 2,000 people have climbed Everest.
It ' s a journey that is right at the limit of human capability.
The second one is , how do you go to the loo at minus 40 ? 
It all started back in 2001.
And the thing that fascinates me about the North Pole , geographic North Pole , is that it ' s slap bang in the middle of the sea.
But I realized on the morning of day one that I had no idea exactly what I ' d let myself in for.
We started running very low on food . We were both pretty hungry , losing lots of weight.
You can see two ski poles sticking out of the roof of the tent.
Ultimately , we ran out of time.
And I felt that I had failed , wholeheartedly.
The first one was reaching the Pole itself.
And of course , neither of these things happened.
In a huge amount of debt personally to this expedition , and lying on my mum ' s sofa , day in day out , watching daytime TV.
No one has made a complete crossing of the Arctic Ocean on their own.
So for some reason , this was what I wanted to have a crack at , but I knew that even to stand a chance of getting home in one piece , let alone make it across to Canada , I had to take a radical approach.
At first it was pretty sensible . We flew British Airways to Moscow.
We got to Khatanga.
Finally , morning of day 11 , we got the all-clear , loaded up the helicopters -- two helicopters flying in tandem -- dropped me off at the edge of the pack ice.
To make things worse , you can just see the white dot up at the top right hand side of the screen ; that ' s a full moon.
When the ice was flat or flattish , I could just about pull both.
NASA described the ice conditions last year as the worst since records began.
I got up in the morning , took the tent down , skied north for seven-and-a-half hours , put the tent up , and I was two and a half miles further back than when I ' d started.
The weather is just appalling -- oh , drifted back about five miles in the last -- last night.
I knew there was more open water . And I had a secret weapon up my sleeve.
So we had a dry suit developed -- I worked with a team in Norway -- based on a sort of survival suit -- I suppose , that helicopter pilots would wear -- that I could climb into . It would go on over my boots , over my mittens , it would pull up around my face , and seal pretty tightly around my face.
Another exciting thing we did last year was with communications technology.
The wireless telescope was a digital camera I had tucked in my pocket.
It wasn ' t all high-tech . This is navigating in what ' s called a whiteout.
So , kind of a weird combination of high-tech and low-tech.
There isn ' t even a pole at the Pole . There ' s nothing there , purely because it ' s sea ice . It ' s drifting.
The only proof I ' ve got that I was there is a blurry photo of my GPS , the little satellite navigation gadget.
Took a few photos . I got my satellite phone out.
And I got three voicemails.
The -- the whole world underneath me.
I wanted to get as close to Canada as I could before conditions just got too dangerous to continue.
We ' d like to pick you up.
The only bit of ice I could find -- it took me 36 hours of skiing around trying to find an airstrip -- was exactly 473 meters . I could measure it with my skis.
It just about worked . A pretty dramatic landing -- the plane actually passed over four times , and I was a bit worried it wasn ' t going to land at all.
I ' m supposed to be the roughty toughty explorer type.
The co-pilot was a lady called Monica.
He threw his cigarette out as he got on the front , and I climbed in the back.
It ' s that little bar there . He put his hand on the throttle.
One of the skis just clipped a pressure ridge at the end of the runway , banking . I could see into the cockpit , Troy battling the controls , and he just took one hand off , reached back , flipped a switch on the roof of the cockpit , and it was the  " fasten seat belt "  sign you can see on the wall.
I mean , it really was starting to break up.
There ' s a cafe and there ' s a tourist shop.
And on a wider scale , it amazes me how people go through life just scratching the surface of their potential , just doing three or four or five percent of what they ' re truly capable of . So , on a wider scale , I hope that this journey was a chance to inspire other people to think about what they want to do with their potential , and what they want to do with the tiny amount of time we each have on this planet.
What ' s next : Antarctica.
Antarctica , if you include the ice shelves , is twice the size of Australia -- it ' s a big place.
There was a tent , a letter to the Norwegian king.
Two of us are doing it.
You ' re the only person that decides how far you go and what you ' re capable of.
cognitive science,economics,medical research,science,technology
And a few years after I left , I went back , and the chairman of the burn department was very excited to see me -- said ,  " Dan , I have a fantastic new treatment for you. " 
He was going to tattoo little black dots on the right side of my face and make me look very symmetric.
I said ,  " Can I see some evidence for this ?  " 
 " Oh , don ' t worry about it, "  he said.
This is coming from a Jewish guy , all right , so that means a lot.
Do women feel pity for you and have sex with you more frequently ?  " 
And I went to his deputy and asked him ,  " What was going on ? 
Right , that ' s what he seems like.
So we had one group that I hoped their performance would be very high , another group that I thought their performance would be very low , and when I got the results , that ' s what we got -- I was very happy -- aside from one person.
He was 20-some years older than anybody else in the sample.
But a couple of days later , we thought about it with my students , and we said ,  " What would have happened if this drunken guy was not in that condition ? 
So we decided not to throw the guy out and to rerun the experiment.
And I ' m sure that it ' s something that we all recognize , and we see that it happens.
Because we don ' t see how conflicts of interest work on us.
In my mind , I was actually a knight trying to help science move along.
I do want to leave you with one positive thought.
http://www.ted.com/talks/karen_thompson_walker_what_fear_can_teach_us.html
Karen Thompson Walker : What fear can teach us
These men were 10,000 miles from home , more than 1,000 miles from the nearest scrap of land.
No one on land had any idea that anything had gone wrong.
As we grow up , we ' re often encouraged to think of fear as a weakness , just another childish thing to discard like baby teeth or roller skates.
 " Don ' t worry, "  we like to say to one another .  " Don ' t panic. " 
What if we thought of fear as an amazing act of the imagination , something that can be as profound and insightful as storytelling itself ? 
And what we say about kids who have fears like that is that they have a vivid imagination.
The same incredible imaginations that produced  " The Origin of Species, "   " Jane Eyre "  and  " The Remembrance of Things Past, "  also generated intense worries that haunted the adult lives of Charles Darwin , Charlotte BrontĂŤ and Marcel Proust.
Twenty-four hours had now passed since the capsizing of the ship.
But they ' d heard some frightening rumors.
Now the last option was the longest , and the most difficult : to sail 1,500 miles due south in hopes of reaching a certain band of winds that could eventually push them toward the coast of South America.
Now we might just as easily call these fears by a different name.
And fears and storytelling have the same components.
Fears also have plots . They have beginnings and middles and ends.
Fears also have suspense.
In other words , our fears make us think about the future.
When I was writing my first novel ,  " The Age Of Miracles, "  I spent months trying to figure out what would happen if the rotation of the Earth suddenly began to slow down.
If an earthquake strikes tonight , I used to worry , what will happen to our house ?  What will happen to my family ? 
Now , some of us naturally read our fears more closely than others.
That ' s one of the things that is so extraordinary about fear.
I think the end of the story of the whaleship Essex offers an illuminating , if tragic , example.
When the last of the survivors were finally picked up by two passing ships , less than half of the men were left alive , and some of them had resorted to their own form of cannibalism.
Why were they swayed by one story so much more than the other ? 
As we ' ve seen , the men of the Essex had no trouble with the artistic part.
But perhaps if they ' d been able to read their fears more like a scientist , with more coolness of judgment , they would have listened instead to the less violent but the more likely tale , the story of starvation , and headed for Tahiti , just as Melville ' s sad commentary suggests.
Read in the right way , our fears are an amazing gift of the imagination , a kind of everyday clairvoyance , a way of glimpsing what might be the future when there ' s still time to influence how that future will play out.
AIDS,global issues,health,health care,sex
That ' s what spreads HIV. " 
This is actually a direct quote from an epidemiologist who ' s been in field of HIV for 15 years , worked on four continents , and you ' re looking at her.
Wonderful.
Now , I remember speaking to an Indonesian friend of mine , Frankie.
So he injects the first guy , and then he ' s wiping the needle on his shirt , and he injects the next guy.
Please let there be some left. '  "  And then , telling me this story , Frankie said ,  " You know .. . God , drugs really make you stupid. " 
And if there ' s one place you really want to get high , it ' s when you ' re in jail.
I mean , nearly 100 percent . Yeah , by sharing needles.
 " So are you carrying a needle ?  " 
So no surprises then that the proportion that actually used clean needles every time they injected in the last week is just about one in 10 , and the other nine in 10 are sharing.
You don ' t want to share a needle anymore than you want to share a toothbrush even with someone you ' re sleeping with.
And that changes the equation slightly , doesn ' t it ? 
Now , let ' s look at it from a policy maker ' s point of view.
You want people to use clean needles -- and junkies want to use clean needles.
And in all of those countries , you can see , not more than four percent of injectors ever became infected with HIV.
So , if she didn ' t invest in effective prevention , she was going to have pick up the costs of treatment later on , and obviously those are much higher.
So what we ' ve been doing in the United States is reviewing the data -- endlessly reviewing the data.
So , completely irrational , you would think.
Now let ' s talk about sex.
It ' s not that easy!
And what we ' ve got is a very , very high level of virus right at the beginning when you ' re first infected , then you start making antibodies , and then it bumps along at quite low levels for a long time -- 10 or 12 years -- you have spikes if you get another sexually transmitted infection.
I ' ve always been a bit curious about that because I think stigma is a bad thing , whereas lots of sex is quite a good thing , but we ' ll leave that be.
And they are heterosexuals who come from countries that have traditions of polygamy and relatively high levels of female autonomy , and almost all of those countries are in east or southern Africa.
Now , in the rest of the world , we ' ve got basically nothing going on in the general population -- very , very low levels -- but we have extraordinarily high levels of HIV in these other populations who are at highest risk : drug injectors , sex workers and gay men.
In most of the world , these few prevention failures notwithstanding , we are actually doing quite well these days in commercial sex : condom use rates are between 80 and 100 percent in commercial sex in most countries.
And , actually , clients don ' t want to go home with a drip either.
This , for example , this gentleman is called Joseph.
Now , funnily enough , this is also Joseph after six months on antiretroviral treatment.
So , if you look at the viremia thing again , if you do start treatment when you ' re sick , well , what happens ?  Your viral load comes down.
Now , am I saying ,  " Oh , well , great prevention strategy.
But what I am doing is calling into question those people who say that more treatment is all the prevention we need.
AIDS was a disfiguring disease that killed you , and HIV is an invisible virus that makes you take a pill every day.
You see the peak in drug injectors before they started the national needle exchange program.
This is of new infections.
It means we need to be doing more prevention the more treatment we have.
But once they ' ve gone from being transgressive people whose behaviors we don ' t want to condone to being AIDS victims , we come over all compassionate and buy them incredibly expensive drugs for the rest of their lives.
Why does she do that job ? 
It varies a bit province to province.
We ' ve got the tools , the knowledge and the cash , and commitment to preventing HIV too.
Elizabeth Pisani :  " When you get to politics , nothing makes sense. " 
There are as many different ways of being rational as there are human beings on the planet , and that ' s one of the glories of human existence.
And everyone who ' s in this room , and everyone who ' s watching this out there on the web , I think , has a duty to demand of their politicians that we make policy based on scientific evidence and on common sense.

I was covering the war in Afghanistan , and I witnessed , as a reporter for Al Jazeera , the amount of suffering and destruction that emerged out of a war like that.
And that regime that we got rid of was actually a dictatorship , an authoritarian regime , that for decades created a great sense of paralysis within the nation , within the people themselves.
I ' m 43 years old right now.
And this is why they revolted.
Would you like to see destruction ? 
For 10 years , unfortunately we have found ourselves reporting images of destruction , images of killing , of sectarian conflicts , images of violence , emerging from a magnificent piece of land , a region that one day was the source of civilizations and art and culture for thousands of years.
Nothing happened . No violence . Nothing.
People who were inspired to go down to the streets and to raise their voices , they tried to kill.
They were surprised by all of these kinds of issues.
 " Bring these kids home because they are misled. " 
We in Al Jazeera were banned from Tunisia for years , and the government did not allow any Al Jazeera reporter to be there.
We are going to be the voice for these voiceless people.
We put it in every sitting room in the Arab world -- and internationally , globally , through our English channel.
And now Libya as you see it.
But this mindset has continued to be faithful to the soil and to the land that it emerged from.
This is the right moment , and this is the actual moment that we see all of these meanings meet together and then create the beginning of this magnificent era that will emerge from the region.
And then when they failed , they started speaking about conspiracies that emerged from Tel Aviv and Washington in order to divide the Arab world.
Be aware of these people who [are] coming to you in order to ruin your great civilization. " 
They have lost.
However , when something of that magnitude happens , we are at the center of the coverage.
I remember one night when someone phoned me on my cellphone -- ordinary person who I don ' t know -- from Tahrir Square.
I felt the responsibility to phone our correspondents there and to phone our newsroom and to tell them ,  " Make your best not to switch off the cameras at night , because the guys there really feel confident when someone is reporting their story -- and they feel protected as well. " 
Let us free ourselves -- especially in the West -- from thinking about that part of the world based on oil interest , or based on interests of the illusion of stability and security.
The future should be ruled by people themselves , even sometimes if they are voices that might now scare us.
And let us give up our narrow selfishness in order to embrace change , and in order to celebrate with the people of that region a great future and hope and tolerance.
Chris Anderson : I just have a couple of questions for you.
Wadah Khanfar : Actually , this may be the biggest story that we have ever covered.
It is not something that you only cover because you have to cover a great incident.
CA : There are a lot of people in the West who are still skeptical , or think this may just be an intermediate stage before much more alarming chaos.
At this moment in time , the youth in the Arab world are much more wiser and capable of creating the change than the old -- including the political and cultural and ideological old regimes.
Mohamed Nanabhay who ' s sitting with us , the head of Aljazeera.net , he told me that a 2,500 percent increase of accessing our website from various parts of the world.
But I can tell you , this is the moment to celebrate through connecting ourselves with those people in the street and expressing our support to them and expressing this kind of feeling , universal feeling , of supporting the weak and the oppressed to create a much better future for all of us.
Thank you for inspiring them and for inspiring all of us.

She was always saying things that made me stop and think , like ,  " Time may be a great healer , but it ain ' t no beauty specialist. " 
Let ' s see if we can get into the flow here and all do this one together.
Well , my true love ' s a black-eyed daisy ; if I don ' t see her , I go crazy.
Now you ' ve got to picture Aunt Zip at 105 years old in Sodom , North Carolina.
Down below , there was her grandson plowing the tobacco field with a mule.
Hey , hey , black-eyed Susie , hey.
Let ' s have the banjo.
Hey , hey , hey , hey . Hey , hey , black-eyed Susie , hey!
Thank you , Michael.
And he played his bluegrass style of music , but near the end of the concert , he played the old timing style of banjo picking that came from Africa , along with the banjo.
He said , well , you can go back to Clinch Mountain , where I ' m from , or Asheville or Mount Airy , North Carolina -- some place that has a lot of music.
And you know , I came back to school , I finished my degrees and told my parents I wanted to be a banjo player.
And play a little banjo . Let ' s do a little medley.
And he lived in that house that his great-grandfather had built.
This instrument came up in those pictures . It ' s called the mouth bow.
It was hard on the cats , but it made a great little instrument.
Now , they were scouts in the rebels '  army , they were known both far and wide.
Well , it was 1954 , I guess it was.
We were really mad at my mom . We looked out the window.
Well , my mom didn ' t put up with much either , and she was driving , and she said ,  " You boys! You think you can have anything you want.
She pulled the car over ; she said ,  " Get out of the car. " 
My mom grabbed us by the shoulders . She marched us out in the field.
Well , that must have seemed like a funny idea to that foreman : put these two middle-class little white boys out in a cotton field in August in Texas -- it ' s hot.
And my brother and I started to pick it , and our hands were startin '  to bleed , and then --  " Mom! " 
He kind of just snuck up behind us and he sang out in a low voice.
Don ' t want it to leave me behind. " 
And I don ' t want it to leave me behind. " 
But the foreman was kind enough to give us each a check for a dollar , but my mother would never let us cash it.
No , we learned something else.
And I also learned that a great song can make hard work go a little easier.
But that day in the cotton field out there picking , when those people started singing , I realized I was in the very heart of real music , and that ' s where I ' ve wanted to be ever since.
Good news : Chariot ' s coming.
And I don ' t want it to leave me behind.
I set that whole thing up.
Let ' s try . Good news : Chariot ' s coming.
It ' s usually played flat on your lap.
Break it off , put it on your finger , and slide into the notes.
I had to make lists of reasons to stay alive.
I didn ' t care about -- I had a radio show , I have a radio show on public radio ,  " Riverwalk, "  I didn ' t care about that . I didn ' t care about awards or money or anything.
And I would sit around with it , and I didn ' t know how to play it , but I would just play stuff as sad as I could play.
Lord , I hate to hear that news.
People say ,  " Oh , snap out of it! " 
Now , you can try to keep it all inside with drink and drugs and cigarettes , but you know that ' s not going to get you where you want to get.
Oh , I think I ' ve got time to tell you about this . My dad was an inventor.
They were about my age.
I thought , damn , those are going to be some big pants!
So we looked in that -- this was a commercial chemistry set.
Well , obviously the next thing to do was build a cannon.
Through the garage.
Well , my brother heard that we had made gunpowder.
They said , we ' re going to melt it down and make rocket fuel.
It became Chris Berquist ' s job to do the melting down.
It just flared up , and he turned around , and he looked like this.
But we thought of it often , because every time she ' d cook tuna surprise it made -- tasted faintly of gunpowder.
At that time , drum triggers were new.
It ' s going to really hurt if I don ' t take that off . Okay.
http://www.ted.com/talks/stefan_sagmeister_the_power_of_time_off.html
Stefan Sagmeister : The power of time off
We are totally closed.
As I realized , just like with many many things in my life that I actually love , I adapt to it.
Quite the similar idea , then , a perfume packaged in a book , in a die cut.
And I thought it might be helpful to basically cut off five of those retirement years and intersperse them in between those working years.
And they rang very true for me.
In a career I ' m definitely more engaged.
I had spent my first sabbatical in New York City.
Sri Lanka still had the civil war going on , so Bali it was.
However the first thing that I needed was mosquito repellent typography because they were definitely around heavily.
As a little retaliation with a just ever so slightly menacing message on the back of the shirt.
So I looked for furniture.
This one , of course , still works with the wild dogs.
It ' s called Be Here Now.
I also started meditating for the first time in my life in Bali.
I think it took me four years to finally read it , while on sabbatical.
His restaurant is open seven months every year.
And he has 2.2 million requests for reservations.
Scotch tape came out of this program , as well as Art Fry developed sticky notes from during his personal time for 3M.
So I ' m not sure if you saw your neighbor putting their hand up.
And then I told as many , many people as I possibly could about it so that there was no way that I could chicken out later on.
Sending mail to Japanese design magazines and things like that.
Was not very successful . And so on and so forth.
I had fun.
And I ' ll show you a couple of projects that came out of the seven years following that sabbatical.
And even though I desired to do an identity that doesn ' t use the architecture , I failed at that.
So then it became quite easy.
You put any image in there , like that Beethoven image.
If Zappa ' s music is performed , it gets its own logo.
It has a more transparent identity.
Like this Donna Toney poster , or Chopin , or Mozart , or La Monte Young.
Second insight . So far , until that point I had been mostly involved or used the language of design for promotional purposes , which was fine with me.
There must be something else.
I ' ll just show two now.
After two weeks , three weeks , four weeks , five weeks.
We used the stone plates as a grid for our little piece.
And the idea of course was to make the type so precious that as an audience you would be in between ,  " Should I really take as much money as I can ? 
And the Amsterdam police in all their wisdom , came , saw , and they wanted to protect the artwork.
So after eight hours that ' s pretty much all that was left of the whole thing.
They weren ' t quite slick enough.
And my studio is very close to the monkey forest.
So of course whatever you don ' t really do yourself doesn ' t really get done properly.
Then you can of course always go and see this guy.

Lee Smolin on science and democracy
We want to get out of this thing where the young people have all the ideas , and the old people have all the power and decide what science gets done.
But in any case , what I’m going to do in my little bit of time is take you on a quick tour of some of the things that we talk about and we think about.
And this is , by the way , something that a democratic society also has to do.
I’m not going to read them all to you because I’m not in teacher mode.
So it’s this combination of respect for the tradition and community we’re in , and rebellion that the community requires to get anywhere , that makes science work.
The first science of cosmology that was anything like science was Aristotelian science , and that was hierarchical.
Where something is , is defined with respect to this last sphere , the celestial sphere , outside of which is this eternal , perfect realm , where lives God , who is the ultimate judge of everything.
And they were very closely associated.
In a Newtonian universe , there’s no center -- thank you.
Of who else there is , of the history and so forth.
It was begun with the invention of relativity theory and quantum theory.
Space is just one aspect , so there’s no meaning to say absolutely where something is.
All properties of things are about these kinds of relationships.
This is also , if you talk to legal scholars , the foundations of new ideas in legal thought.
This last view of cosmology is called the relational view.
And in a relational universe the only possible explanation was , somehow it made itself.
Now , Darwin taught us that there are processes of self-organization that suffice to explain all of us and everything we see.
So a theory of biology based on natural selection requires a relational notion of what are the properties of biological systems.
In the 20th century , we saw the independent development of two big themes in science.
At the same time , we physicists have been busy trying to make sense of and build on and integrate the discoveries of quantum theory and relativity.
And what they’re evolving towards is the union of these two big ideas , Darwinism and relationalism.
And you understand some things better than other things , and because of that there’s a continual jostling and give and take , which is politics.
http://www.ted.com/talks/jack_horner_shape_shifting_dinosaurs.html
Jack Horner : Shape-shifting dinosaurs
All right.
We ' re going to kind of go in a different direction right now.
People ask me a lot -- in fact , one of the most asked questions I get is , why do children like dinosaurs so much ? 
Well that ' s not true , but we ' ll get to the goose in a minute.
And there ' s lots of different shapes.
And this is an interesting story.
So everyone was out looking for all these bigger and better dinosaurs.
They ' re all big.
People assumed -- and this was actually a problem -- people assumed that if they had little dinosaurs , if they had juvenile dinosaurs , they ' d be easy to identify.
First off , scientists have egos , and scientists like to name dinosaurs.
And what happened , of course , is we ended up with a whole bunch of different dinosaurs.
And it ' s kind of cool -- if you look at the cassowary , or any of the birds that have crests on their heads , they actually grow to about 80 percent adult size before the crest starts to grow.
So you can see that if you actually found one that was 80 percent grown and you didn ' t know that it was going to grow up to a cassowary , you would think they were two different animals.
So this was interesting.
And so they went on naming dinosaurs because they were different.
You go into a museum and they take really good care of them.
So they don ' t normally let you do that.
And if you cut into an older dinosaur , it ' s very massive.
In North America in the Northern Plains of the United States and the Southern Plains of Alberta and Saskatchewan , there ' s this unit of rock called the Hell Creek Formation that produces the last dinosaurs that lived on Earth.
So my students , my staff , we ' ve been cutting them open.
And we want to look at these three first.
But no one ever considered that they might be more closely related.
So people were looking at these and they were talking about how different they are.
And then there ' s this thing called Dracorex , Hogwart ' s Eye.
But they did look at these three and they said ,  " These are three different dinosaurs , and Dracorex is probably the most primitive of them.
Dracorex is the littlest one , Stygimoloch is the middle size one , Pachycephalosaurus is the largest one.
Scientists like to name things.
If you cut open Stygimoloch , it is doing the same thing.
The spikes on the back of the Stygimoloch are actually resorbing , which means they ' re getting smaller as that dome is getting bigger.
Okay.
There ' s a Triceratops in every museum in the world , but no one had ever collected a juvenile.
So we went out and collected a whole bunch of stuff and we found a whole bunch of little ones.
When you have a little museum , you have little dinosaurs.
And that ' s pretty cool.
And the middle size one is really spongy.
But there ' s another dinosaur that is found in this formation that looks like a Triceratops , except it ' s bigger , and it ' s called Torosaurus.
 " And it has holes in its frill. " 
So now we know that Torosaurus is actually a grownup Triceratops.
They thought Torosaurus should be kept and Triceratops thrown out , but that ' s not going to happen.
It ' s a giant duck-bill dinosaur.
And we get rid of Anatotitan.
Again , makes you wonder.
So it must be true -- they must be different. " 
And at the Museum of the Rockies where we work , I have four T . Rexes , so I can cut a whole bunch of them.
So again , real easy to say that Tyrannosaurus ontogeny included Nanotyrannus , and therefore we can take out another dinosaur.
Now as you can imagine , this is not very popular with fourth-graders.

And it gets worse , I crashed it into your house.
 " Thank you for sharing , that ' s really interesting. " 
Nuclear fusion , I had about 10 minutes on that.
That one ' s gone as well.
So , that ' s going to look pretty shabby now.
Thank you . Bruno ' s face , just then , he said ,  " No , don ' t go through this . Don ' t , please don ' t.
So , the idea of changing the world is really quite an extraordinary one.
It ' s great . It ' s fantastic.
I mean , he must walk in and they will say ,  " Would you like a macchiato , or a latte , or an Americano , or a cappuccino ?  " 
And Elaine Morgan yesterday , wasn ' t she wonderful ? 
And she ' s desperate to find more evidence for the link.

Thou shalt not kill , thou shalt not steal , thou shalt not covet thy neighbor ' s wife. " 
I just , can I just say a few things about , first about Cherie , because she ' s a wonderful lady , my wife , with a wonderful smile.
Another thing Gordon could have mentioned in his speech to the Mansion House in 2002 -- that was to the building ; the people weren ' t listening.
This is the first time that I can remember , where if you get a letter from the bank manager about a loan , you don ' t know if you ' re borrowing money from him , or if he ' s borrowing money from you.
Why would you do that ?  Why would -- It ' s like one step up from replying to one of those emails from Nigeria , isn ' t it ? 
What does it have ?  It has fish , that ' s all.
Luckily , somebody like George Bush was really helpful.
And that ' s , you know , that ' s something -- And that ' s something we can relate to.
And then you got the unknown unknowns , those are the things we don ' t know we don ' t know. " 
In 2006 , the head of the American Mortgage Bankers Association said , quote ,  " As we can clearly see , no seismic occurrence is about to overwhelm the U.S . economy. " 
But we have a new hope . We have a new man.
How many people here are left-handed ? 
And I thought , what a wonderful metaphor , isn ' t it ?  An American President who has to write without smudging the ink.
I ' m right-handed but I seem to have smudged that ink as well. " 
I happen to believe it was a great error.
There is now. " 
But now he ' s gone , and it ' s great to see one of the -- arguably one of the worst speech makers in American history , now given way to one of the greatest , in Obama.
But you get the picture . And then it goes to the inauguration.
But the interesting thing is , Gordon Brown was talking about Cicero , who said , people would listen to a speech , they said ,  " Great speech. " 
Do you remember that film with Helen Hunt and Jack Nicholson , and Helen Hunt says to Jack Nicholson ,  " What do you see in me ?  " 
We like what Barack Obama says , but we don ' t do anything about it.
And everyone goes ,  " Great idea. " 
And it ' s great to have an American president who can say the word  " nuclear, "  let ' s just point that out first.
Thank you very much.
 " Travels the world. " 
 " .. . somebody ' s gla -- hand. " 
And I , you know. " 
Or , any South Africans , we have Mandela to inspire.
 " So , Nelson , how would you like a nice water feature ?  " 
Very quickly : I wasn ' t quite sure how to end this talk and then yesterday that man came up with a wonderful quote from the  " Japanese Essays on Idleness "  which said it ' s nice to have something which is unfinished because it implies there is still room for growth.

Our work is across media . The work comes in all shapes and sizes.
And these are everyday conventions , conventions that are so obvious that we are blinded by their familiarity.
This is an image that won us a competition for an exhibition pavilion for the Swiss Expo 2002 on Lake Neuchatel , near Geneva.
And this proposal was a reaction to the over-saturation of emergent technologies in recent national and world expositions , which feeds , or has been feeding , our insatiable appetite for visual stimulation with an ever greater digital virtuosity.
Water ' s pumped from the lake and is filtered and shot as a fine mist through an array of high-pressure fog nozzles , 35,000 of them . And a weather station is on the structure.
It ' s about 300 feet wide , the size of a football field , and it sits on just four very delicate columns.
Unlike entering any normal space , entering Blur is like stepping into a habitable medium.
And we pride ourselves -- it ' s a spectacular anti-spectacle in which all the conventions of spectacle are turned on their head.
The public , you know , once disoriented can actually ascend to the angel deck above and then just come down under those lips into the water bar.
You know , when we did this project it was a kind of tough sell , because the Swiss said ,  " Well , why are we going to spend , you know , 10 million dollars producing an effect that we already have in natural abundance that we hate ?  " 
And this is the highest honor to be bestowed upon an architect in Switzerland -- to have a chocolate bar.
In 2003 , the Whitney mounted a retrospective of our work that featured a lot of this work from the  ' 80s and  ' 90s.
This was something done at the Cartier Foundation.
It ' s a kind of invention of the museum that ' s supposed to bring a kind of cohesive understanding to the public of a body of work.
And we actually had to install white walls to separate these pieces , which didn ' t belong together.
So , the drill was mounted on this robotic arm.
In any case , the way it works is that an intelligent navigator basically maps the entire surface of these walls.
Initially these holes were lone blemishes , and as the exhibition continued the walls became increasingly perforated.
And also the acoustic separation was destroyed.
So rather than securing a neutral background for the artworks on display , the wall now actively competed for attention.
It ' s the ICA -- the Institute of Contemporary Art -- in Boston , which is on the waterfront.
So , you come in and you ' re basically squeezed by the theater , by the belly of the theater , into this very compressed space where the view is turned off.
And many musicians choose to use the theater glass walls totally open.
This was eliminated because the view was too good , and the mayor said ,  " No , we just want this open. " 
So , it ' s already sticking out into space enough , and then from that is this , is this small area called the Mediatheque.
But there is just no information , it ' s just -- it ' s just hypnosis.
But we ' re doing it with a lot less testosterone.
So , this is the entrance to Tully Hall as it used to be , before the renovation , which we just started.
We basically did a striptease , architectural striptease , where we ' re framing with this kind of canopy -- the underside of three levels of expansion of Juilliard , about 45,000 square feet -- cutting it to the angle of Broadway , and then exposing , using that canopy to frame Tully Hall.
So , the hall is a multi-purpose hall.
How do you bring an intimacy into a hall ? 
Another thing that could be fixed is the shape of the hall.
Because we can ' t eliminate a single seat , the architecture is restricted to 18 inches.
But it ' s acoustically engineered to focus the sound into the house and back to the stage . And here ' s an acoustic shelf.
So now that we ' ve stripped the hall of all visual distraction , everything that prevents this intimacy which is supposed to connect the house , the audience , with the performers , we add one little detail , one piece of architectural excess , a special effect : lighting.
And this is a mockup that is in Salt Lake City that gives you a sense of what this is going to look like in full-scale.
I have no ending to say , except that I ' m a couple of minutes over.

My doctors told me that my lung capacity had gone down to 70 percent , and it was killing me.
The botanical names are in front of you.
The second plant is Mother-in-law ' s Tongue , which is again a very common plant , and we call it a bedroom plant , because it converts CO2 into oxygen at night.
With these three plants , you can grow all the fresh air you need.
Our studies have found that there is a 42 percent probability of one ' s blood oxygen going up by one percent if one stays indoors in this building for 10 hours.
Our experience points to an amazing increase in human productivity by over 20 percent by using these plants.
It is also important for the environment , because the world ' s energy requirements are expected to grow by 30 percent in the next decade.
And thank you for listening.

PM : Oh.
I ' ll tell you what happened.
And so I happened to have a snake pin.
And then I thought , well this is fun.
MA : Pretty big.
PM : So is this a good idea.
What was interesting was that , before I went up to New York as U.N . ambassador , I talked to Jeane Kirkpatrick , who ' d been ambassador before me , and she said ,  " You ' ve got to get rid of your professor clothes.
And one of the things -- if you remember Condoleezza Rice was at some event and she wore boots , and she got criticized over that.
and so how did you handle that ? 
But basically I love being a woman.
and  " will I really say something intelligent ?  " 
I think we are a lot better at personal relationships , and then have the capability obviously of telling it like it is when it ' s necessary.
PM : What a change that is.
And therefore it means that we have to remember that , while many of us have had huge opportunities -- and Pat , you have been a real leader in your field -- is that there are a lot of women that are not capable of worrying and taking care of themselves and understanding that women have to help other women.
PM : And did you get pushback from making that a central tenant of foreign policy ? 
Now for instance , some of the wars that took place when I was in office , a lot of them , the women were the main victims of it.
And by the way , one of the things that I did at that stage was , I had just arrived at the U.N. , and when I was there , there were 183 countries in the U.N.
And I thought when I ' d get to my apartment that there ' d be a lot of women there.
And so we set it up , and we called ourselves the G7.
And then what happened was that they were able to declare that rape was a weapon of war , that it was against humanity.
MA : Well I do think , when there are more women , that the tone of the conversation changes , and also the goals of the conversation change.
So for instance , what I did when I went to Burundi , we ' d got Tutsi and Hutu women together to talk about some of the problems that had taken place in Rwanda.
And so it was nice when one of them would show up.
We went to a meeting , and the men in my delegation , when I would say ,  " Well I feel we should do something about this, "  and they ' d say ,  " What do you mean , you feel ?  " 
But I think it really does help to have a critical mass of women in a series of foreign policy positions.
More women ' s voices at the table ? 
I think we also need to be supportive when businesses are being created and just make sure that women help each other.
In fact , I think  " guilt "  is every woman ' s middle name.
Thank you for joining us today.

That ' s an Englishman asking an Irishman to be succinct.
Then I thought , let ' s go even further than 25 years.
You , your miserableness , have got to be kidding. " 
Crowds are gathered in Tahrir Square.
So I thought , forget the rock opera , forget the bombast , my usual tricks.
Because what the facts are telling us is that the long , slow journey , humanity ' s long , slow journey of equality , is actually speeding up.
Malaria : There are eight countries in sub-Saharan Africa that have their death rates cut by 75 percent.
Let ' s just stop for a second , actually , and think about that.
This is Michael and Benedicta , and they ' re alive thanks in large part to Dr . Patricia Asamoah -- she ' s amazing -- and the Global Fund , which all of you financially support , whether you know it or not.
And this great news gives birth to even more great news , because the historic trend is this.
Now , the rate is still too high -- still too many people unnecessarily losing their lives.
This is everything.
That ' s what the data is telling us . If the trajectory continues , we get to , wow , the zero zone.
That ' s amazing.
There are all kinds of benefits to this.
I mean , it ' s about three Rolling Stones farewell concerts away.
Well , the opportunity is real , but so is the jeopardy.
And the next one is really beautiful.
There is jeopardy , and of course , the closer you get , it gets harder.
You can tell politicians that these cuts [can cost] lives.
We ' re pushing for laws that make sure that at least some of the wealth under the ground ends up in the hands of the people living above it.
Daylight , you could call it , transparency.
This is exciting stuff.
You can erase that , you really can , because it ' s not true anymore.
So I ' m here to -- I guess we ' re here to try and infect you with this virtuous , data-based virus , the one we call factivism.
By doing so , you will join us and countless others in what I truly believe is the greatest adventure ever taken , the ever-demanding journey of equality.
I ' m thinking of Wael Ghonim , though.
We are going to win because we don ' t play their dirty games.
Wael is right.
In 2007 , Paul Rothemund gave TED a short summary of his specialty , DNA folding . Now he lays out in clear , abundant detail the immense promise of this field -- to create tiny machines that assemble themselves.
So , people argue vigorously about the definition of life.
So this is a computer program.
But one , to me , that ' s most compelling is the peculiar sensitivity to small changes that can make large changes in biological development -- the output.
Now , a hallmark of computer programs is just this kind of sensitivity to small changes.
And what I want to do is write molecular programs , potentially to build technology.
So my friends , molecular programmers , and I have a sort of biomolecule-centric approach.
There ' s the solar panels of the cell , some switches that turn your genes on and off , the girders of the cell , motors that move your muscles.
If we succeed , what will molecular programming look like ? 
And what happens if you water and feed that seed appropriately , is it will do a developmental computation , a molecular computation , and it ' ll build an electronic computer.
And for molecular programming , the question is how does your cell phone know when to stop growing ? 
One of them is Craig Venter ' s question.
This is exactly analogous to the question , what ' s the smallest program I can write that will act exactly like Microsoft Word ? 
Now , these are big questions in computer science.
So , I ' m going to start asking those questions for the DNA structures I ' m going to talk about next.
We want to look at individual strands and not think about the double helix.
But a lot of their approaches , though elegant , take a long time.
So , you can go to a natural source.
Double strand again , but inside them , they ' re infected with a virus that has a nice , long , single-stranded genome that we can fold like a piece of paper.
Each one has a left half that binds the long strand in one place , and a right half that binds it in a different place , and brings the long strand together like this.
We heat them up , we add a little bit of salt , we heat them up to almost boiling and cool them down , and as we cool them down , the short strands bind the long strands and start to form structure.
That holds the long strand like this.
So I had the computer program design the short staples to do this.
So , they ' re all floating around in solution , and to look at them , you have to get them on a surface where they stick.
There ' s the atomic-force microscope working and you can see that the landing ' s a little rough.
And so , I got this in the mail about a year after I did this , unsolicited.
She wrote all her own software to design and built this DNA origami , a beautiful rendition of China , which even has Taiwan , and you can see it ' s sort of on the world ' s shortest leash , right ? 
So , you can put circuit components on the staples , like a light bulb and a light switch.
They took a DNA origami , organized some carbon nano-tubes , made a little switch , you see here , wired it up , tested it and showed that it is indeed a switch.
Now , I want to get back to that compiler.
You can compile it to molecules , send it to a synthesizer , and it actually works.
The fact is that it does not scale.
It was started by Erik Winfree , and what it does , it has tiles that are a hundredth the size of a DNA origami.
So , these tiles would make a complicated , self-assembling checkerboard.
So you can read off binary numbers five , six and seven.
So , what we ' ve done is we ' ve figured out a way to have a molecular program know when to stop going.
It doesn ' t tell us how babies do it , however.
So , what we ' ve done is we ' ve succeeded in making something much bigger than a DNA origami by combining DNA origami with tiles.
So , this sort of recapitulates what I was telling you about development.
If we wanted to make a square of size 10 , 100 or 1,000 , if we used DNA origami alone , we would require a number of DNA strands that ' s the square of the size of that square ; so we ' d need 100 , 10,000 or a million DNA strands.
And so computation is some very powerful way to reduce the number of molecules you need to build something , to reduce the size of the genome that you ' re building.
So you can actually make a complicated circuit using a little bit of computation.
Here is a DNA origami rectangle , and here are some tiles growing from it.
So , it turns out we actually had this idea nine years ago , and that ' s about the time constant for how long it takes to do these kinds of things , so I think we made a lot of progress.
I want you to remember that to create life ' s very diverse and complex forms , life uses computation to do that.
It ' s not just making about -- it ' s making self-assembled cell phones and circuits.

So , I share it with all of you here today , though the idea itself is getting crystallized and I ' m still writing up the business plan.
I built , along with my two brothers , the leading real estate company in my home state , Kerala , and then worked professionally with two of India ' s biggest businessmen , but in their startup enterprises.
For those from the developing world , there is nothing , absolutely nothing new in this idea.
The service responded effectively and efficiently , during the unfortunate 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks.
It ' s a small message from us , in our own small way to the enemies of humanity , of Islam , of South Asia , of India , and of Pakistan , that humanity will continue to bloom , irrespective of such dastardly attacks.
I guess we seem to be doing at least a few things right.
Corruption , bribes , and lack of transparency.
According to World Bank estimate , one trillion dollars is paid in bribes every year , worsening the condition of the already worse off.
In the modern day world , where time is premium and battle for subsistence is unimaginably tough , the hapless common man simply gives in and pays the bribe just to get on with life.
But what is the use if the police department is in itself steeped in corruption ? 
Yet the market forces around the world have not yet thrown up a service where you can call in , pay a fee , and fight the demand for a bribe.
All she needed was permission to build three steps to her house , from ground level , making it easier for her to enter and exit her house.
A group of us have been working on a pilot basis to address individual instances of demands for bribes for common services or entitlement.
The target market is as tempting as it can get.
I do realize that the fight for justice against corruption is never easy.
The battle against corruption exacts a toll on ourselves , our families , our friends , and even our kids.
For we are insane people , trying to do an impossible task.
CA : What ' s on your mind ? 
The officer was just sitting on it and was demanding around 3,000 rupees in bribes.
A set of people actually say ,  " Oh , let me just grant it to them , and run away from it. " 
By the third time , in all 42 cases , we have achieved success.
CA : That ' s a high gross margin business . I like it.
I mean , this could be huge.

But what did he appeal to ? 
Instead , what he told us was to put aside childish things.
And besides , some of you might be wondering , what the hell does it mean ? 
They ' re the things you would expect : mop the floors , sweep them , empty the trash , restock the cabinets.
The janitor ' s job could just as well be done in a mortuary as in a hospital.
And behavior like this from janitors , from technicians , from nurses and , if we ' re lucky now and then , from doctors , doesn ' t just make people feel a little better , it actually improves the quality of patient care and enables hospitals to run well.
These janitors have the moral will to do right by other people.
A wise person knows how to improvise , as Luke did when he re-washed the floor.
To serve other people , not to manipulate other people.
You need permission to be allowed to improvise , try new things , occasionally to fail and to learn from your failures.
It takes lots of experience to learn how to care for people.
The bad news is that without wisdom , brilliance isn ' t enough.
It ' s a story about lemonade.
Dad , being an academic , had no idea that Mike ' s Hard Lemonade contained alcohol.
And they were ready to let the kid go.
At that point , can the child go home ? 
How do things like this happen ? 
When things go wrong , as of course they do , we reach for two tools to try to fix them.
Better ones , more of them.
Fix the incentives , fix the incentives , fix the incentives ...
It ' s preposterous on its face.
And without intending it , by appealing to rules and incentives , we are engaging in a war on wisdom.
Here ' s an example from Chicago kindergarten.
We know why these scripts are there.
But what they assure in its place is mediocrity.
But too many rules prevent accomplished jazz musicians from improvising.
If you have one reason for doing something and I give you a second reason for doing the same thing , it seems only logical that two reasons are better than one and you ' re more likely to do it.
I ' ll just give you one example because time is racing.
And they said ,  " Would you be willing to have a nuclear waste dump in your community ?  " 
But it had to go somewhere and they had responsibilities as citizens.
Instead of 50 percent saying yes , 25 percent said yes.
Get smarter incentives.
But excessive reliance on incentives demoralizes professional activity in two senses of that word.
And we certainly see it in the world of business.
One way not to do it : teach more ethics courses.
Acknowledge , when you go to law school , that a little voice is whispering in your ear about Atticus Finch.
Well , acknowledge them.
That ' s one thing we can do.
 " Maybe on paper our company is worth less to Wall Street , but I can tell you it ' s worth more . We ' re doing fine. " 
Why ?  Because it was the right thing to do.
Yesterday we heard Willie Smits talk about re-foresting in Indonesia.
I ' m boggled at how much he and his associates needed to know in order to plot this out.
So there ' s a lot here at TED , and at other places , to celebrate.
As practitioners each and every one of us should strive to be ordinary , if not extraordinary heroes.
Because the truth is that any work that you do that involves interaction with other people is moral work.
One is that we are always teaching.
And he talked about a lot of the wonderful things that KIPP is doing to take inner-city kids and turn them in the direction of college.
They need to learn to respect their schoolmates.
If you do that , the rest is just pretty much a coast downhill.
And the virtue I think we need above all others is practical wisdom , because it ' s what allows other virtues -- honesty , kindness , courage and so on -- to be displayed at the right time and in the right way.
I think people want to be allowed to be virtuous.
Paying attention to what we do , to how we do it , and , perhaps most importantly , to the structure of the organizations within which we work , so as to make sure that it enables us and other people to develop wisdom rather than having it suppressed.
Soldiers who ' ve lost limbs in service face a daily struggle unimaginable to most of us . At TEDMED , Dean Kamen talks about the profound people and stories that motivated his work to give parts of their lives back with his design for a remarkable prosthetic arm.
It ' s not about technology , it ' s about people and stories.
But that would sort of be jumping to the middle of the story , and I ' m not going to show you that polished video.
I get this sort of unrequested -- by me anyway -- visit , and sitting in my conference room is a very senior surgeon from the military and the guy that runs DARPA.
The bad news is if they ' ve collected this person and he or she is missing an arm or leg , part of the face , it ' s probably not coming back.
And they basically said ,  " This is unacceptable, "  and then the punchline :  " So , Dean , we ' re here because you make medical stuff.
If it ' s the grape , they won ' t break it. " 
Either way they were going to eat it.
So , they finished that . And I , as you can tell , am a bashful guy.
Now , I cannot imagine -- I ' m sorry , you may have a better imagination than I do -- I can ' t imagine losing my arm , and typically at 22 years old.
I literally could not sleep thinking about ,  " I wonder how you ' d roll over with no shoulders. " 
And I ' ve got a lot of day jobs.
I told them it would probably take five years to get through the FDA , and probably 10 years to be reasonably functional.
It will take the other nine to make it functional and useful. " 
I could show you it with a cosmesis on it that ' s so real it ' s eerie , but then you wouldn ' t see all this cool stuff.
He ' s literally , he ' s got no shoulder on one side , and he ' s high trans-humeral on the other.
He picks up a spoon , picks it up , scoops out some Shredded Wheat and milk , holds the spoon level as he translates it , moving all these joints simultaneously , to his mouth , and he doesn ' t drop any milk.
So , you ' ve got a choice : We keep the arm , or you keep Chuck. " 
There ' s Randy , these guys are passing a rubber little puck between them.
Now Chuck is doing something quite extraordinary , at least for my limited physical skill.
But , as I ' ve learned from Richard , the technology , the processors , the sensors , the motors , is not the story.
It doesn ' t matter whether the Department of Defense likes this arm. " 
They ' re probably going to be angry , depressed , frustrated.
We did see a bunch of people , a lot of them missing a lot of body parts , and parts they had left were burned ; half a face gone , an ear burned off.
I could give you fine motor control , or I could let you curl 40 pounds ; I probably can ' t do both.
 " Well , would it help if I ... " 
You could see he was missing an arm.
And he said ,  " You know , I ' m the lucky guy at this table.
And he made a few comments.
So , we left.
So , we went back.
And it was astounding how positive they are.
And I get a call and we go back to Washington.
And I went down and they rolled him into a room.
Half of his face is gone , but they said his vision is coming back.
 " You ' ll get them. " 
 " Sure. " 
He wants to help . He told me that he wanted to go back to help his buddies.
I said ,  " What am I going to say ? 
And , as I think you get the point , there were a lot people there recovering.
I don ' t think anybody does it intentionally , but there were people there literally talking about ,  " Well , how much will they get ?  " 
Who is going to pay for it ?  " 
They were tough questions . There ' s polarized groups down there.
How do we get out ? 
It is an easy answer.
Wilbur and Orville.
I think eventually we ' ll make these things extraordinary. " 
And whining and complaining about what our foreign policy ought to be.
In this highly personal talk from TEDMED , magician and stuntman David Blaine describes what it took to hold his breath underwater for 17 minutes -- a world record -- and what his often death-defying work means to him . Warning : do NOT try this at home.
As a magician , I try to create images that make people stop and think.
And it ended up being so much fun that I decided I could pursue doing more of these things.
I began to hallucinate so hard that the buildings that were behind me started to look like big animal heads.
There was so many skeptics , especially the press in London , that they started flying cheeseburgers on helicopters around my box to tempt me.
As a young magician I was obsessed with Houdini and his underwater challenges.
In 1987 I heard of a story about a boy that fell through ice and was trapped under a river.
As a magician , I think everything is possible.
And I asked him , how long is it possible to go without breathing , like how long could I go without air ? 
And I stayed inside of that water tank hoping my core temperature would start to drop.
 " I want to hold my breath for a really long time . How could it be done ?  " 
But this is that attempt.
And it ' s so high in oxygen levels that in theory you could breathe it.
Then I started thinking , would it be possible to hook up a heart/lung bypass machine and have a surgery where it was a tube going into my artery , and then appear to not breathe while they were oxygenating my blood ? 
So , I started researching into pearl divers.
There is many different aspects to free-diving.
That was the one that I studied.
I had to remain perfectly still and just relax and think that I wasn ' t in my body , and just control that.
You do that , you get lightheaded , you get tingling.
Every morning , this is for months , I would wake up and the first thing that I would do is I would hold my breath for , out of 52 minutes , I would hold my breath for 44 minutes.
I would repeat this process eight times in a row.
And you have these awful headaches.
And this guy is perfectly built for holding his breath.
We ' ll say big-boned.
I ate really small controlled portions throughout the day.
Which is lower than most Olympic athletes.
I decided that I was going to break the world record live on prime-time television.
I entered the sphere a week before the scheduled air date.
This was a critical mistake.
And by seven minutes and 30 seconds they had to pull my body out and bring me back.
This was a different record . This was a pure O2 static apnea record that Guinness had set the world record at 13 minutes.
So , I would sleep in a hypoxic tent every night.
Every morning , again , after getting out of that tent your brain is completely wiped out.
So , he pulled me up , and I was fine.
I then announced that I was going to go for Sietas '  record , publicly.
Which was three minutes longer than I had prepared.
So , I did what any person seriously pursuing scientific advancement would do.
And I did a dive down to 160 feet , which is basically the height of a 16 story building , and as I was coming up , I blacked out underwater , which is really dangerous ; that ' s how you drown.
But there was no way to prepare for the live television aspect of it , being on Oprah.
So , I had to use my legs to hold my feet into the straps that were loose , which was a real problem for me.
So , every time my heart would beat I ' d hear the beep-beep-beep-beep , you know , the ticking , really loud.
This time it started at 120 beats , and it never went down.
And I was getting more nervous.
When I made it to the halfway mark , at eight minutes , I was 100 percent certain that I was not going to be able to make this.
I kept pushing to 10 minutes . At 10 minutes you start getting all these really strong tingling sensations in your fingers and toes.
And I ' m a hypochondriac , and I remember arm numb means heart attack.
It was awful.
My heartbeat would go from 120 , to 50 , to 150 , to 40 , to 20 , to 150 again.
So , at 16 minutes what I did is I slid my feet out because I knew that if I did go out , if I did have a heart attack , they ' d have to jump into the binding and take my feet out before pulling me up . So , I was really nervous.
They had doctors with the  " Pst, "  you know , so , sitting there waiting.
So , with the energy of everybody that was there I decided to keep pushing.
I had the world record and I wanted to make sure it was legitimate.
I was like  " What ?  " 
It ' s practice , it ' s training , and it ' s -- It ' s practice , it ' s training and experimenting , while pushing through the pain to be the best that I can be.

Discuss . Great creativity is astonishingly , absurdly , rationally , irrationally powerful.
It can make war seem like tragedy or farce.
This is a time of need.
Here is one such scrap from an initiative I ' m involved in using creativity to inspire people to be greener.
A deer with an itchy leg . A flying motorcycle.
Sure , she had aged a little.
 " Don ' t say another word , Gusty, "  she said , for that was his name.
Gusty entered her boldly and made love to her rhythmically while she filmed him , because she was a keen amateur pornographer.
Andy Hobsbawm : We ' ve got the science , we ' ve had the debate.
So this is a call , a plea , to the incredibly talented TED community.
Ashraf Ghani ' s passionate and powerful 10-minute talk , emphasizing the necessity of both economic investment and design ingenuity to rebuild broken states , is followed by a conversation with TED curator Chris Anderson on the future of Afghanistan.
A public , Dewey long ago observed , is constituted through discussion and debate.
If we looked in the world of 1945 and looked at the map of capitalist economies and democratic polities , they were the rare exception , not the norm.
And it is necessary , no matter how fragile or how provisional our consensus , to be able to move forward.
First , extractive industry.
Tens of billions of dollars are supposedly spent on building capacity with people who are paid up to 1,500 dollars a day , who are incapable of thinking creatively , or organically.
But we are not dealing with the implications of the one world that we are living in.
What is one of these organizations to pick ? 
My country is dominated by drug economy and a mafia.
Second , instead of debating endlessly about what is the structure of the state , why don ' t we simplify and say , what are a series of functions that the state in the 21st century must perform ? 
And it ' s legitimate monopoly of means of violence , administrative control , management of public finances , investment in human capital , provision of citizenship rights , provision of infrastructure , management of the tangible and intangible assets of the state through regulation , creation of the market , international agreements , including public borrowing , and then , most importantly , rule of law.
Who would have imagined that Germany would be either united or democratic today , if you looked at it from the perspective of Oxford of 1943 ? 
The least important form of capital , in this project , is financial capital -- money.
And what is required is a combination of physical capital , institutional capital , human capital -- and security , of course , is critical , but so is information.
Do we need to repeat the modalities that we have inherited ? 
They need different ways of being approached , different ways of being enfranchised , different ways of being skilled.
You only want clean environments in which to function.
It ' s for your own immediate use.
As the work on paradigms , long time ago showed -- Thomas Kuhn ' s work -- it ' s in the intersection of ideas that new developments -- true breakthroughs -- occur.
Will democracy flourish ?  What scares you most ? 
Today the world of globalization is on speed.
Every conceivable form of infrastructure had broken down.
Any meaningful sort of thing.
We were bombed practically out of existence.
How to turn a donkey , a carthorse , anything.
I mean , I really can ' t believe how lucky I am here , standing in front of you , speaking.
You see , because , I mean -- I give you one statistic.
Abandonment.
Yes , I have an advisory position with the U.N.
They see engagement , global engagement , as absolutely necessary to the future of the ordinary people.
That gives me hope.
Look , there ' s a very little known fact : countries that have a legal average income per capita of 1,000 dollars don ' t produce drugs.
The textile industry is incredibly mobile.
Look , the ordinary Afghan is sick and tired of hearing about microcredit.
Yeah , we have the best embroiderers in the world!
And what I will say here is that aid doesn ' t work.
Yeah , to be exact , you know , I managed to persuade the world that they had to give my country 27.5 billion.
It ' s that a dollar of private investment , in my judgment , is equal at least to 20 dollars of aid , in terms of the dynamic that it generates.
And this is , again , one of those assumptions -- the way car seats are an assumption that we ' ve inherited in governments , and doors.
And every year there must be progress on mobilization of domestic revenue and generation of the economy.

And then I ' ll let you in on a secret , which is why I am an incurable optimist.
Because , with our present knowledge , we have no idea what would happen.
Well , it ' s been calculated a few degrees '  rise in the earth ' s temperature would melt the polar ice caps.
Larry Brilliant : Should we feel good , or should we feel bad that 50 years of foreknowledge accomplished so little ? 
And if it will be , it ' s the right thing to do , and if not , rethink it. " 
Let ' s review them both . First of all , the megatrends.
Even though we ' ve dodged Paul Ehrlich ' s population bomb , and we will not see 20 billion people in this decade , as he had forecast , we eat as if we were 20 billion.
The rural areas are no longer producing as much food as they did.
In Africa last year , Africans ate 600 million wild animals , and consumed two billion kilograms of bush meat.
Most of us are the beneficiaries of that growth . But it has a dark side -- in bioweapons , and in technology that puts us on a collision course to magnify any anger , hatred or feeling of marginalization.
The one percent will own even more than 40 percent of all the world ' s goods and services . Not because they ' ve grown richer , but because the rest of the world has grown increasingly poorer.
Last year , there were 85,000 riots in China , 230 a day , that required police or military intervention.
And the newly emerging diseases may make H5N1 and bird flu a quaint forerunner of things to come . It ' s a destabilized world.
For others , withdrawal , nihilism , materialism.
First , even if carbon dioxide emissions stopped today , global warming would continue.
So here ' s Bangladesh.
Now we ' re looking down south , through the Kali Gandaki.
And now let ' s look from the south , looking up , and let ' s see this in relief.
But if you look at the globe , all around the earth , wherever there is low-lying area , populated areas near the water , you will find increase in sea level that will challenge our way of life.
Global warming is something that happens to all of us , all at once.
And then we watched , as one case arrived on the East Coast of the United States and it marched every year , westwardly.
It ' s more than enough reason for pessimism.
We ' ve been here before , paralyzed by fear , paralyzed into inaction , when some -- probably one of you in this room -- jumped into the breach and created an organization like Physicians for Social Responsibility , which fought against the nuclear threat , Medicins Sans Frontieres , that renewed our commitment to disaster relief , Mohamed ElBaradei , and the tremendous hope and optimism that he brought all of us , and our own Muhammad Yunus.
We may see the eradication of guinea worm next year -- there are only 35,000 cases left in the world.
It ' s an amazing phenomenon.
They ' re actively guiding their money , their resources , their hearts , their commitments , to make the world a better place.
Today , there ' s another kind of movement . It ' s a movement to save the earth.
Al Gore made presentations in the House and the Senate as an expert witness.
It is something to be greatly optimistic about.
And you can feel this optimistic move to save the earth in the air.
But for me , I have another reason to be an incurable optimist.
It should make you optimistic that smallpox no longer exists because it was the worst disease in history.
When you read the biblical plague of boils , that was smallpox.
In a cruel reversal , after we had almost conquered smallpox -- and this is what you must learn as a social entrepreneur , the realm of the final inch.
And we had to start all over again.
And most importantly for us here in this room , a bond was created.
At TED2010 , mathematics legend Benoit Mandelbrot develops a theme he first discussed at TED in 1984 -- the extreme complexity of roughness , and the way that fractal math can find order within patterns that seem unknowably complicated.
Please excuse me for sitting ; I ' m very old.
There are many different kinds of mess.
But it is not so.
Others of them are very real , in a certain sense.
If you try to weigh it -- of course it ' s very easy to weigh it , and when you eat it , the weight matters -- but suppose you try to measure its surface.
So the experience of humanity has always been that there are some shapes which have this peculiar property , that each part is like the whole , but smaller.
That one can measure roughness by a number , a number , 2.3 , 1.2 and sometimes much more.
Now , it didn ' t take me any time.
They were done on a computer , and the only input is a number , and that number is roughness.
Humanity had to learn about measuring roughness.
Well , you measure and measure and measure.
The concept of length of coastline , which seems to be so natural because it ' s given in many cases , is , in fact , complete fallacy ; there ' s no such thing.
To begin with , artificial landscapes , which I invented sort of , are used in cinema all the time.
It used to be very time-consuming , but now it ' s nothing.
The volume of a lung is very small , but what about the area of the lung ? 
Enormous disagreements.
Now , what good is it to have that ? 
And a surprising aspect of it is that very often , the rules of this geometry are extremely short.
And at the end , you get things like that.
Something so complicated like a cloud , so unstable , so varying , should have a simple rule behind it.
I was very much involved in it , but then turned my attention to other phenomena.
Mathematicians got into self-praise to an extent which was absolutely amazing , that man can invent things that nature did not know.
A man named Peano did define such curves , and it became an object of extraordinary interest.
And well , it ' s a story unto itself.
Well , a man named Hausdorff in 1919 introduced a number which was just a mathematical joke , and I found that this number was a good measurement of roughness.
The things on the ground are algae.
I could speak of that for a long time.
One day I decided -- halfway through my career , I was held by so many things in my work -- I decided to test myself.
Then I was telling my assistant ,  " I don ' t see anything . Can you paint it ?  " 
So Brownian motion , which happens to have a roughness number of two , goes around.
Mathematical problem : how to prove it ? 
So they got the big [Fields] medal in mathematics , one of the three medals that people have received for proving things which I ' ve seen without being able to prove them.
Well actually I started , oddly enough , studying stock market prices.
It was very easy , and you can write many books very fast about it.
Well , these other lines include some real price increments and some forgery which I did.
But I tell you , at this point , people listened to me.
And you have the little nonsense which is left.
If you master these , you master price , and if you don ' t master these , you can master the little noise as well as you can , but it ' s not important.
My adolescence was spent during the German occupation of France.
This is a construction of a man named [Gaston] Julia and [Pierre] Fatou.
But then the computer came , and I decided to apply the computer , not to new problems in mathematics -- like this wiggle wiggle , that ' s a new problem -- but to old problems.
It ' s so simple , so dry.
I don ' t want to explain these things.
And that was one of my major discoveries , to find that these islands were the same as the whole big thing , more or less.
The color was added for two reasons.
It ' s so complicated.
Obviously , from extraterrestrials.
Bottomless wonders spring from simple rules , which are repeated without end.

In the history of our planet , there have been three great waves of evolution.
We altered our ecological niche by creating civilization.
Now we ' re entering a third great wave of evolutionary history , which has been called many things :  " intentional evolution, "   " evolution by design "  -- very different than intelligent design -- whereby we are actually now intentionally designing and altering the physiological forms that inhabit our planet.
And if you think of dogs for example , dogs are now intentionally-designed creatures.
We don ' t have to do it that way anymore.
This is a geep , a goat-sheep hybrid.
A cama is a camel-llama hybrid , created to try to get the hardiness of a camel with some of the personality traits of a llama.
It ' s bigger than a tiger.
None of this is Photoshopped . These are real creatures.
These are normal mammalian cells genetically engineered with a bioluminescent gene taken out of deep-sea jellyfish.
And what you see here is these cells glowing in the dark under certain wavelengths of light.
They did it with pigs.
In other words , it is theoretically possible that before too long we will be biotechnologically capable of creating human beings that glow in the dark.
These are zebra fish that have been genetically engineered to be yellow , green , red , and they are actually available now in certain states.
And so some states have decided to allow them , some states have decided to ban them.
And before you get too worried about it , here in the United States , the majority of food you buy in the supermarket already has genetically-modified components to it.
He actually was the first person to clone a dog , which is a very difficult thing to do , because dog genomes are very plastic.
But if you can clone that horse , you can have both the advantage of having a gelding run in the race and his identical genetic duplicate can then be put out to stud.
So with antithrombin in that goat -- that goat has been genetically modified so that the molecules of its milk actually include the molecule of antithrombin that GTC Genetics wants to create.
A somatic cell , a body cell , was taken from its body , gestated in the ovum of a cow , and then that cow gave birth to a guar.
We have our nucleic DNA that everybody thinks of as our DNA , but we also have DNA in our mitochondria , which are the energy packets of the cell.
And it raises the question of how we ' re going to define animal species in the age of biotechnology -- a question that we ' re not really sure yet how to solve.
They ' ve created a kind of insect bot , or bugbot.
They have a computer chip strapped to their backs , and they can fly these creatures around the lab.
But it ' s the closest they can get to a landing.
It ' s not just insects.
They have it running through mazes , controlling where it ' s going.
I ' ll get back to that in a minute.
The computer learned what the monkey brain did to move its arm in various ways.
The monkey recognized that whatever she did with her arm , this prosthetic arm would do.
He took 20,000 and then 60,000 disaggregated rat neurons -- so these are just individual neurons from rats -- put them on a chip.
Finally , Mussa-Ivaldi of Northwestern took a completely intact , independent lamprey eel brain.
So now we have a complete living lamprey eel brain.
This is a mouse created by Charles Vacanti of the University of Massachusetts.
Finally , not that long ago , Craig Venter created the first artificial cell , where he took a cell , took a DNA synthesizer , which is a machine , created an artificial genome , put it in a different cell -- the genome was not of the cell he put it in -- and that cell then reproduced as the other cell.
But in fact , that ' s not what Frankenstein ' s lab looks like.
For the first time in the history of this planet , we are able to directly design organisms.
Do we have free reign to design animals ? 
Do we get to create organic robots , where we remove the autonomy from these animals and turn them just into our playthings ? 
We are now taking control of our own evolution.
Thanks.

He lived in a fairly wealthy home.
And the observations that he made on that epic journey were to be eventually distilled into his wonderful book ,  " On the Origin of Species, "  published 150 years ago.
Now in his years of traveling on the Beagle , and from listening to the accounts or explorers and naturalists , he knew that skin color was one of the most important ways in which people varied.
Well he didn ' t write anything about it in The Origin of Species.
So he had traveled all around.
If only Darwin had NASA.
Now the really hot pink and red areas are those parts of the world that receive the highest amounts of UV during the year.
And what Darwin could not appreciate , or didn ' t perhaps want to appreciate at the time , is that there was a fundamental relationship between the intensity of ultraviolet radiation and skin pigmentation.
The earliest members of our lineage , the genus Homo , were darkly pigmented.
In those early days of our evolution , looking at the equator , we were bombarded by high levels of ultraviolet radiation.
It ' s very destructive , but it also catalyzes the production of vitamin D in the skin , vitamin D being a molecule that we very much need for our strong bones , the health of our immune system , and myriad other important functions in our bodies.
Why change it if it works ? 
But then we moved.
Conditions were significantly colder , but they were also less intense with respect to the ultraviolet regime.
In the winter , when you are skiing in the Alps , you may experience ultraviolet radiation.
Because what happened , in order to ensure health and well-being , these lineages of people dispersing into the Northern Hemisphere lost their pigmentation.
Not just in modern humans , but in one of our distant unrelated ancestors , the Neanderthals.
Here are just some of the biggest movements of people , voluntary movements , in the last 5,000 years.
Now this had all sorts of invidious social consequences.
Well , often we ' re unaware of the fact that we ' re living in environments in which our skin is inherently poorly adapted.
We have to , if we ' re lightly pigmented , be careful about the problems of skin cancer , and destruction of folate in our bodies , by lots of sun.
Vitamin D deficiency creeps up on people , and causes all sorts of health problems to their bones , to their gradual decay of their immune systems , or loss of immune function , and probably some problems with their mood and health , their mental health.
So how can we overcome this ? 
How wonderful is that ? 
And he resembles , very closely , people with moderate levels of pigmentation who live in southern Africa , or Southeast Asia.
Now what is wonderful about the evolution of human skin pigmentation , and the phenomenon of pigmentation , is that it is the demonstration , the evidence , of evolution by natural selection , right on your body.
Darwin , I think , would have appreciated this , even though he eschewed the importance of climate on the evolution of pigmentation during his own life.
You , you can teach it.
Take your skin color , and celebrate it.
Go out . Isn ' t it beautiful ?  Isn ' t it wonderful ?

Two thousand and seven , five years ago , my wife gets diagnosed with breast cancer , stage IIB.
Should it be a mastectomy ?  Should it be a lumpectomy ? 
And these were being pressed upon us by the doctors.
These are well-meaning doctors , some of them have gone on to become very good friends.
I said , is there any validity to this whole adage that when you ' re making decisions , it ' s best to take the driver ' s seat , be in charge , be in control ? 
And I ' m going to share one of these studies with you today.
You are going to solve a series of puzzles , and I ' m going to show you examples of these puzzles momentarily.
In order to solve these puzzles effectively , if you think about it , your mind needs to be in two states simultaneously.
Now comes the between-subjects design , the AB design , the AB testing.
You can decide , what is your mental state : Okay , I ' m going to choose the caffeinated tea , I ' m going to choose the chamomile tea.
And you know that.
We ' ll give another five minutes for the ingredient to have its effects.
Baba Shiv : Whoa!
These are tricky puzzles because your first instinct is to say  " tulip, "  and then you have to unstick yourself.
Anyone ?  It ' s much more difficult.
Okay , so you have 30 minutes now to solve these 15 puzzles.
Less effort , you ' re less persistent , and so on.
You will spend less time compared to you.
Now , that brings us now to , why does this happen ? 
So , if you think about it , in this particular puzzle task , it could happen in investing in the stock market , very volatile out there , it could be the medical situation -- the feedback here is immediate.
In terms of the difficulty level of these puzzles.
Volatile stock market , getting negative feedback that ' s also immediate.
You were responsible for your decision.
That casts your decision in doubt , reduces the confidence you have in the decision , reduces the confidence you have in the performance , the performance in terms of solving the puzzles.
Less juice , which means keeping herself or himself less physically fit , physically active to hasten the recovery process , which is what is often advocated . You probably wouldn ' t do that.
It has now been five years , slightly more than five years , and the good news , thank God , is that the cancer is still in remission.

Eleni Gabre-Madhin on Ethiopian economics
And what is happiness ? 
And who gets to express it , and how do we express it ? 
In 1984 , in what can only be considered one of the greatest crimes of humanity , nearly one million people died of starvation in my country of birth , Ethiopia.
And most of Africa ' s farmers are , by and large , small farmers in terms of land that they operate , and very , very small farmers in terms of the capital they have at their disposal.
Road density is six times greater in Asia than it is in rural Africa.
He comes to the market when prices are lowest , with the meager fruits of his hard labor , just after the harvest , because he has no choice.
Meaning , in fact , that farmers are rational and profit-minded just like everybody else.
Over two decades ago , the world insisted to Africa that markets must be liberalized , that economies must be structurally adjusted.
Did our farmers turn into highly productive commercial actors ? 
And it seems to me that the reforms might have thrown the baby out with the bath water.
Africa ' s markets are weak not only because of weak infrastructure in terms of roads and telecommunications , but also because of the virtual absence of necessary market institutions , such as market information , grades and standards , and reliable ways to connect buyers and sellers.
And really realized that that was because -- as traders would tell me over and over -- that ' s the only way people know what they ' re getting in terms of the quantity and the product quality.
And this leads to very high handling costs.
In fact , in my view , there is no region of the world and no period in history that farmers have been expected to bear the kind of market risk that Africa ' s farmers have to bear.
To give you an example , between 2001 and 2002 , Ethiopian maize farmers produced two years of bumper harvest.
Not six months later , in July 2002 , Ethiopia announced a major food crisis , to the same proportions as 1984 : 14 million people at risk of starvation.
Well , I ' m not here today to lament about the situation , or wring my hands.
In the 1980s , it was very fashionable to talk about getting prices right.
Nearly three years ago , I decided to leave my comfortable job as a World Bank senior economist in Washington and come back to my country of birth , Ethiopia , after nearly 30 years abroad.
Now , the commodity exchange itself , that concept , is not new to the world.
In the American Midwest , farmers used to load grain onto barges and send it upriver to the Chicago market.
From there , the greatest innovation of all came about in this market , which is that buyers and sellers could transact grain without actually having to physically or visually inspect the grain.
But that is actually changing.
This is powered by low-cost VSAT technology , aggressively trying to reach farmers to bring them into the market.
So , the ECX is an Ethiopian exchange for Ethiopia.
And this is because one of the things we ' ve learned over the last decade of studying market development in Africa is that the piecemeal approach does not work.
But at the same time , we ' ll do something which I think no exchange in the world has ever done , which is itself to operate something like an Internet cafe in the rural areas.
Obviously , we work with exchange actors , and as we ' re developing the exchange market itself , we ' re also developing the regulatory infrastructure and legal framework , the overarching legal framework for making this market work.
Whereas before the farmer used to think local -- meaning that he or she would go to the nearest local market , eight to 10 kilometers away on average , and sell whatever they happened to have , without any idea of what the price premium or anything else was -- now farmers come with knowledge of what prices are at the national market.
So all of this will transform farmers.
It seems very ambitious.
ECX is the market for Ethiopia ' s new millennium , which starts in about eight months.
Ethiopia ' s domestic market is about one billion dollars of value.
The will is there.
http://www.ted.com/talks/magnus_larsson_turning_dunes_into_architecture.html
Magnus Larsson : Turning dunes into architecture
Now , as architects we ' re trained to solve problems.
My response is a sandstone wall made from bacteria and solidified sand , stretching across the desert.
It is always the same , never the same , endlessly fascinating.
Some of those grains may then cement naturally into sandstone.
But , moving mountains can be dangerous . Let me try and explain why.
The name means  " edge of the desert. " 
And it ' s one that gets very little attention.
It seriously threatens the livelihoods of millions of people , and especially in Africa and China.
That ' s a potential scenario if we fail to take this seriously.
That ' s the Sahara eating up almost [two meters] a day of the arable land , physically pushing people away from their homes.
This is where the village used to be.
Now , sand dunes cover only about one fifth of our deserts.
If you want to stop a sand dune from moving , what you need to make sure to do is to stop the grains from avalanching over its crest.
Now there is an alternative to just planting trees and hoping that they won ' t get chopped down.
If people live inside of the green barrier they can help support the trees , protect them from humans , and from some of the forces of nature.
All we need to do is solidify the parts that we need to be solid , and then excavate the sand , and we have our architecture.
How do we glue those grains of sand together ? 
What happens is , you pour Bacillus pasteurii onto a pile of sand , and it starts filling up the voids in between the grains.
He managed to do it in a mere 1,400 minutes.
And , after an initial cost of 60 bucks to buy the bacteria , which you ' ll never have to pay again , one cubic meter of bacterial sand would be about 11 dollars.
Then , a few years afterwards , using permacultural strategies , we green that part of the desert.
So , we have a way of turning sand into sandstone , and then creating these habitable spaces inside of the desert dunes.
And I realized that if I scaled them up , they would provide me with good spatial qualities , for ventilation , for thermal comfort , and for other things.
We see the result , the traces , if you like , of the Bacillus pasteurii being harnessed to sculpt the desert into these habitable environments.
So , there it is -- architectural anti-desertification structures made from the desert itself.
And quite frankly , we ' re putting our heads in the sand.
I would like to conclude by showing you an animation of the structure , and leave you with a sentence by Jorge Luis Borges.
But , it ' s a beginning , it ' s a vision.
Using wikis and digital fabrication tools , TED Fellow Marcin Jakubowski is open-sourcing the blueprints for 50 farm machines , allowing anyone to build their own tractor or harvester from scratch . And that ' s only the first step in a project to write an instruction set for an entire self-sustaining village .
Hi , my name is Marcin -- farmer , technologist.
Then we set out to create an open source , DIY , do it yourself version that anyone can build and maintain at a fraction of the cost.
I had no practical skills.
I bought a tractor -- then it broke.
I needed tools that were robust , modular , highly efficient and optimized , low-cost , made from local and recycled materials that would last a lifetime , not designed for obsolescence.
And I found that industrial productivity can be achieved on a small scale.
And now the project is beginning to grow on its own.
If we can lower the barriers to farming , building , manufacturing , then we can unleash just massive amounts of human potential.
Our goal is a repository of published designs so clear , so complete , that a single burned DVD is effectively a civilization starter kit.
If this idea is truly sound , then the implications are significant.
In this bracing talk , coral reef ecologist Jeremy Jackson lays out the shocking state of the ocean today : overfished , overheated , polluted , with indicators that things will get much worse . Astonishing photos and stats make the case.
I ' m an ecologist , mostly a coral reef ecologist.
And that was what I did.
Those reefs at Discovery Bay , Jamaica were the most studied coral reefs in the world for 20 years.
Then , in 1980 , there was a hurricane , Hurricane Allen.
And the reefs disappeared , and new islands formed , and we thought ,  " Well , we ' re real smart.
And the reason was because of overfishing , and the fact that a last common grazer , a sea urchin , died.
And that ' s more or less the story of the coral reefs of the Caribbean , and increasingly , tragically , the coral reefs worldwide.
And the reason it keeps getting worse is that after a natural catastrophe , like a hurricane , it used to be that there was some kind of successional sequence of recovery , but what ' s going on now is that overfishing and pollution and climate change are all interacting in a way that prevents that.
Cod fed most of the people of Western Europe.
It ' s a little hard to understand that , because you can go to a Costco in the United States and buy cheap fish.
This picture here shows the trophy fish , the biggest fish caught by people who pay a lot of money to get on a boat , go to a place off of Key West in Florida , drink a lot of beer , throw a lot of hooks and lines into the water , come back with the biggest and the best fish , and the champion trophy fish are put on this board , where people take a picture , and this guy is obviously really excited about that fish.
And they tasted really good.
Industrial fishing uses big stuff , big machinery.
Think of it as being kind of the bulldozing of a city or of a forest , because it clears it away.
What that was , was a forest of sponges and coral , which is a critical habitat for the development of fish.
And all of that stuff is really disgusting , but what ' s really insidious is the biological pollution that happens because of the magnitude of the shifts that it causes to entire ecosystems.
It ' s a bit of an embarrassment.
But , instead of devouring the people in the shop , what it ' s doing is overgrowing and smothering virtually all of the bottom-dwelling life of the entire northwestern Mediterranean Sea.
It ' s subsidized , which is one of the reasons we used too much of it.
And in the process they use up all the oxygen , and in using up all the oxygen they make the environment utterly lethal for anything that can ' t swim away.
And another version of this sort of thing is what is often called red tides or toxic blooms.
You ' re looking at the entire northwestern Gulf of Mexico ; you ' re looking at one toxic dinoflagellate bloom that can kill fish , made by that beautiful little creature on the lower right.
And that ' s retirement homes on the west coast of Florida.
And then this is amazing.
And so there ' s this war between the farmers and the fishermen about it all , and the net result is that the beaches of Brittany have to be bulldozed of this stuff on a regular basis.
Well , the Northwest Passage is already there.
For all the denial of climate change by government leaders , the CIA and the navies of Norway and the U.S . and Canada , whatever are busily thinking about how they will secure their territory in this inevitability from their point of view.
Except it ' s supposed to be brown.
The corals say ,  " You cheated . You didn ' t pay your rent. " 
And you come home , and you discover that 80 percent of all the trees in North America and in Europe have dropped their leaves.
But there are these , what we call , positive feedbacks , the synergies among them that make the whole vastly greater than the sum of the parts.
We really don ' t know.
Then you sure won ' t want to eat fish that were raised in it , because it would be a kind of gastronomic Russian roulette.
As the surface of the ocean gets warmer , the water is lighter when it ' s warmer , it becomes harder and harder to turn the ocean over.
So the question is : How are we all going to respond to this ? 
So the question is : Will we respond to this or not ?

In the summer of 1950 , Enrico Fermi , the Italian-American physicist and atomic-pile builder , went to lunch at Los Alamos National Laboratory and joined some colleagues there , and asked them a question :  " Where is everybody ?  " 
You see , this was only a few years after the supposed flying saucer crash at Roswell , New Mexico.
And the universe is so old that unless we were the very first civilization ever to evolve , we should have some evidence of their existence by now.
Now , I am not a scientist.
One is that the aliens might be very far away.
Isn ' t it a little convenient that in the midst of the World War , out of nowhere , suddenly an Italian scientist showed up with an amazing new technology that would transform everything in the world and darken the history of the human species forever after ? 
But it is strange.
For even in my own life , there are memories I have that are difficult to explain -- happenings that are so odd and unaccountably weird , that it is difficult to imagine they were not the result of prolonged and frequent contact with aliens throughout my life.
And I went on vacation with my parents to the Jersey shore.
Occasionally , kids would come and join me and watch , but their necks soon got sore , and they would go off to the boardwalk to play video games and mingle with humans.
I would say they were in their late seventies , and I would say that they were on a date , because he was wearing a very neat little suit with a yellow tie -- a brown suit.
You have to admit , that ' s a pretty boss piece of detective work for an old man on a date.
And then his girlfriend joined in , too.
I looked around.
I did not know why they were teasing me.
Slits for mouths ? 
The old man reached out his knobbly claw for the woman ' s hand , and found it , and left me alone.
I went to see the movie  " Dune, "  and a girl talked to me . Now , on its face -- -- this is impossible on its face , I realize -- but it is absolutely true.
She had long , curly black hair , a blue jean jacket.
I didn ' t know her name , and I never will.
And then it got stranger.
But it was also the tone of how she asked the question : apropos of nothing , like she didn ' t even care about the answer , as though she just wanted to talk to me.
I need not remind you that this was David Lynch ' s version of  " Dune, "  in which all of the characters were sexy and deformed at the same time.
I mean , I liked him a lot better than the sandworms.
Except for the girl.
And so I sure am glad I did not slow down to talk to her.
And he also described the phenomenon known in this community as  " lost time, "  where Whitley Strieber would suddenly become aware that he could not remember the previous ten minutes , or the previous ten hours , or the previous ten days.
And it was so successful that they made it into a movie.
Two : the alien was played by a rubber puppet.
Does something seem strange about this to you ? 
I remember walking out of the theater and becoming suddenly aware of this fact , as we walked hand in hand , and pondering these very same questions.
We stayed in old , crumbling , walled cities , in tiny little hotels , and we would climb up to the roof and drink Vinho Verde and watch the sun set and play checkers.
For what it ' s worth , we went to Sagres , which was considered , at the time , to be the end of the world.
Now , Faro is a bustling little city , and to get to the beach , she explained , you would have to take a bus and then a boat.
The freckles had grown and multiplied on her face and shoulders , clustering into a kind of a tan.
She was a single woman about to go alone into a country , not even speaking the language , to travel alone by bus and boat to go to a beach she did not know or had never seen.
Nervous , I went down to the street to look for her.
I realized that the day would only have two possible outcomes : either Catherine would come back to the hotel , or she would never come back to the hotel.
It was at that moment , in that very small town of 30,000 or so , that I truly appreciated the vastness of the universe and the searching we might do in it.
And he said ,  " Don ' t worry. "  He was sure that Catherine would be safe.
We are not alone.
Neither did the Liberians , although there was a huge amount of relief in their laughter as they clapped us on the back , and went back up to their room and left us alone in the street , holding hands.
Thank you for your kind attention.

And hope actually is at the heart of this.
And we ' ve grown our economies so much that we now stand in a real danger of undermining hope -- running down resources , cutting down rainforests , spilling oil into the Gulf of Mexico , changing the climate -- and the only thing that has actually remotely slowed down the relentless rise of carbon emissions over the last two to three decades is recession.
We can ' t live with it ; we can ' t live without it.
And I think we are a clever species sometimes.
And I want to ask the question : how far and how fast would be have to move ? 
This is the carbon intensity of economic growth in the economy at the moment.
Maybe we can do it , maybe it ' s possible -- who knows ? 
It ' s a bit complex , and I apologize for that.
That ' s called the circular flow of the economy.
And what it does essentially is to stimulate further consumption growth.
It ' s a process of the production and reproduction of novelty , continually chasing expanding consumer markets , consumer goods , new consumer goods.
Status-driven , conspicuous consumption thrives from the language of novelty.
A life without shame : in his day , what that meant was a linen shirt , and today , well , you still need the shirt , but you need the hybrid car , the HDTV , two holidays a year in the sun , the netbook and iPad , the list goes on -- an almost inexhaustible supply of goods , driven by this anxiety.
But this -- I just want to show you some data here.
And in the mean time , personal savings absolutely plummeted.
It ' s a story about us , people , being persuaded to spend money we don ' t have on things we don ' t need to create impressions that won ' t last on people we don ' t care about.
And almost straightaway we actually run up against a couple of anomalies.
They want to spend less and save more.
It ' s an anomaly , it ' s a place where the system actually is at odds with who we are as people.
Well , I had my own personal insight into this a few years ago.
And we ' d been doing this for a while , when she turned to me very solemnly and said ,  " Will this really keep out the giraffes ?  " 
Goodness knows what they make of the Lake District weather.
 " What is the objective of the consumer ?  " 
So who are we ? 
Well psychology actually says there is a tension -- a tension between self-regarding behaviors and other regarding behaviors.
Novelty is adaptive when things are changing and you need to adapt yourself.
What we ' ve done is we ' ve created economies.
It is about opening up.
Well , it might look a little bit like the 4,000 community-interest companies that have sprung up in the U.K . over the last five years and a similar rise in B corporations in the United States , enterprises that have ecological and social goals written into their constitution at their heart -- companies , in fact , like this one , Ecosia.
And Ecosia works in pretty much the same way.
And we ' re going to do it.
It ' s taking profits from one place and allocating them into the protection of ecological resources.
Only now , investment isn ' t going to be about the relentless and mindless pursuit of consumption growth.
It has to be investing in low-carbon technologies and infrastructures.
But it ' s also clear that prosperity goes beyond this.
And we need that relationship to reflect , to reclaim hope.
It ' s clear that we have a responsibility to make room for growth where growth really matters in those poorest nations.
Ubuntu says ,  " I am because we are. " 
It ' s not about overthrowing capitalism.
Chris Anderson : While they ' re taking the podium away , just a quick question.
We ' re actually all happier , and a country ' s more beautiful , and our lives are better. " 
Can I picture politicians doing it ? 
CA : But is it mainly politicians who are going to have to get their act together , or is it going to be more just civil society and companies ? 
But actually opening up the space to think about different ways of governing , different kinds of politics , and creating the space for civil society and businesses to operate differently -- absolutely vital.
CA : Tim , thank you for a very important talk . Thank you.

This is a photograph from when I visited Prudhoe Bay in Alaska in 2002 to watch the Minerals Management Service testing their ability to burn oil spills in ice.
We ' re four percent of the world ' s population ; we use 25 percent of the world ' s oil production.
I highly recommend that you get a chance to see crude oil burn someday , because you will never need to hear another poli sci lecture on the geopolitics of oil again.
Oil is a stew of hydrocarbon molecules.
And it goes all the way over to these big , thick , galumphy ones that have hundreds of carbons , and they have thousands of hydrogens , and they have vanadium and heavy metals and sulfur and all kinds of craziness hanging off the sides of them.
It is this chemistry that makes oil so disastrous.
It spreads out to be really thin , so you have a hard time corralling it.
It also makes it very viscous.
When the chemistry of the oil and water also hits our politics , it ' s absolutely explosive.
Nobody gets up in the morning and thinks ,  " Wow! I ' m going to go buy some three-carbon-to-12-carbon molecules to put in my tank and drive happily to work. " 
I am helpless over this. " 
That shows you how bad it is.
Now there ' s another perverse thing about the way we buy gas , which is that we ' d rather be doing anything else.
Well , the reason is , is because , when we ' re buying gas , we ' re very invested in this sort of cognitive dissonance.
I mean -- and this is funny , it looks funny here.
We talk about biofuels that haven ' t been invented yet.
This is an early-on photograph -- you can see , we had these gushers.
It ' s the  " Beverly Hillbillies, "  basically.
It was terrifying ; you think Walmart is a terrifying business model now , imagine what this looked like in the 1860s or 1870s.
And here ' s one of the things that Ida Tarbell said -- she said ,  " He has a thin nose like a thorn.
I mean , this is a very pervasive -- this is part of our DNA.
And we ' ve sort of personalized the whole oil industry into these CEOs.
But it makes for good theater , and it ' s powerfully cathartic as you probably saw last week.
They really influence people.
Everything that we are really stemmed from this period.
We connect the dots in the supply chain.
We actually need to go in and work on the roots of the problem.
We stopped drilling in ANWR , but we didn ' t actually reduce the amount of oil that we consumed.
We only have two percent of the world ' s oil reserves ; 65 percent of them are in the Persian Gulf.
And we can wrap our heads around the spills , because that ' s what we see here , but in fact , these guys actually live in a war zone.
And it ' s sort of one of the other groups of people who pay a price for us.
We put it in . There was a tremendous banditry problem.
They have their own private sort of army around them at the oil fields.
This is 1988 -- we actually bombed two Iranian oil platforms that year.
Now what ' s happened in the Gulf of Mexico -- as you can see , this is the Minerals Management diagram of wells for gas and oil.
So the people of the Gulf have essentially been subsidizing the rest of us through a less-clean environment.
They ' re actually spending more on their car and fuel than they are on taxes or on health care.
What are the laws ?  What do we have to do to keep ourselves focused ? 
The moratoriums are fine , but we do need to focus on the molecules on the oil.
It comes in on the side -- the useful stuff is the dark gray , and the un-useful stuff , which is called the rejected energy -- the waste , goes up to the top.
For example , we have an insurance system where the person who drives 20,000 miles a year pays the same insurance as somebody who drives 3,000.
We need to make the gas price better reflect the real cost of oil.
It ' s called STRONG , which is  " Secure Transportation Reducing Oil Needs Gradually, "  and the idea is instead of being helpless , we need to be more strong.
I actually -- I agree that a dollar a gallon on oil is probably too much , but I think that if we started this year with three cents a gallon on gasoline , and upped it to six cents next year , nine cents the following year , all the way up to 30 cents by 2020 , that we could actually significantly reduce our gasoline consumption , and at the same time we would give people time to prepare , time to respond , and we would be raising money and raising consciousness at the same time.
So you ' re not helpless at the pump.
And so this -- you can see that you ' re paying considerably less than the health care costs on the tax.
So , three million barrels a day.

Cynthia Schneider : The surprising spread of  " Idol "  TV
But you might not recognize Aydah Al Jahani , who is a contestant , indeed a finalist , in the Poet of the Millions competition , which is broadcast out of Abu Dhabi , and seen throughout the Arab world.
But my point in discussing this is to show you -- I hope I ' ll be able to show you how these merit-based competitions , with equal access to everyone , with the winner selected via voting by SMS , are changing tribal societies.
We are going to watch  " Afghan Star. "  We are late.
In Afghanistan , people go to extraordinary lengths to be able to watch this program.
People become so engaged that they have volunteers , just like political volunteers anyway , who fan out over the countryside , campaigning for their candidate.
This has opened up the door , particularly for women.
But she also confides that she knows that members of the Taliban are actually SMS-ing votes in for her.
But , once she started to win , then they got behind her again.
So just by presenting herself and being in competition with men -- this shows the voting on the program -- it sets a very important example for young women -- these are young women in the audience of the program -- in Abu Dhabi , but also people in the viewing audience.
And for Afghanistan , where the Taliban banned music for many years , it is reintroducing their traditional music.
And the final , sort of , formulation of this  " American Idol "  format , which has just appeared in Afghanistan , is a new program called  " The Candidate. " 
http://www.ted.com/talks/lewis_pugh_s_mind_shifting_mt_everest_swim.html
Lewis Pugh ' s mind-shifting Everest swim
The water is completely black.
And then I said to myself , I ' ve just got to get this thought out of my mind as quickly as possible.
And the most immediate thought when I came out of that water was the following : I ' m never , ever going to do another cold water swim in my life again.
The glacier ' s gone all the way up the mountain and left in its place this big lake.
North , you ' ve got China ; south , you ' ve India , Pakistan , Bangladesh , all these countries.
The other thing which was so challenging about this swim is not just the altitude.
I feels like you ' ve got a man standing behind you with a hammer just hitting your head all the time.
And when you ' re walking up the mountain to attempt to do something which no human has ever done before , and , in fact , no fish -- there are no fish up there swimming at 5,300 meters -- When you ' re trying to do that , and then the bodies are coming past you , it humbles you , and you also realize very , very clearly that nature is so much more powerful than we are.
And then we got up to this small lake underneath the summit of Mt . Everest , and I prepared myself the same way as I ' ve always prepared myself , for this swim which was going to be so very difficult.
I was gasping for air.
And then I said , carry on . Carry on . Carry on.
I have never , ever heard such utter bollocks.
And there , we sat down , and we did a debrief about what had gone wrong there on Mt . Everest.
Every single thing which you learned when you were serving in the British army , about speed and aggression , you put that to one side.
Instead of swimming crawl , swim breaststroke.
And I stood there on the edge of the lake , and I looked up at Mt . Everest -- and she is one of the most beautiful mountains on the earth -- and I said to myself , just do this slowly.
The first one is that just because something has worked in the past so well , doesn ' t mean it ' s going to work in the future.
When I was born , the world ' s population was 3.5 billion people.
And I ask you , please , to go away from here and think about that one radical tactical shift which you could make , which will make that big difference , and then commit a hundred percent to doing it.
Inventor and MacArthur fellow Saul Griffith shares some innovative ideas from his lab -- from  " smart rope "  to a house-sized kite for towing large loads.
So anyway , who am I ? 
And I sort of really was dumbstruck.
And that ' s in fact probably what I ' m going to try and tell you about.
And I was laughing about this with the very smart colleagues I have , and said ,  " You know , well , if I have to talk about the future , what is it ?  " 
So , you may think that ' s sort of really crazy , but there are some pretty amazing things that are happening that make this possible.
Basically , what they ' re doing is looking at biology as a programmable system.
This one is a two-bit counter.
So this is interesting in the sense that you can now do  " if-then-for "  statements in materials , in structure.
Took me six years at MIT , and about that many pages to describe what I was doing , and it took him one page . And so this is our muse Tucker.
In this case , he ' s done self-replication of a complex 3D structure.
On the right , that ' s a radiolara.
The secret to biology is , it builds computation into the way it makes things . So this little thing here , polymerase , is essentially a supercomputer designed for replicating DNA.
Can we get complex 3D structure automatically assembling in inorganic systems ? 
These are little mechanical computers.
Now , if I make a string of these , a bit string , they will be able to replicate.
It was work actually by Lionel Penrose , father of Roger Penrose , the tiles guy.
We set them off on this air hockey table.
Well , it turns out biology has this other very interesting meme , that you can take a linear string , which is a convenient thing to copy , and you can fold that into an arbitrarily complex 3D structure.
And that way you can scale things much smaller than microchips.
Each different color has a different magnetic polarity , and the sequence is uniquely specifying the structure that is coming out.
And so I ' m thinking about , you know , what are the programs for programming the physical universe ? 
With the universe as a computer , you can look at this droplet of water as having performed the computations.
This is a machine where you literally define a boundary condition.
And literally with only those two inputs -- so , the shape of your boundary condition and the pressure -- you can define an infinite number of lenses that cover the range of human refractive error , from minus 12 to plus eight diopters , up to four diopters of cylinder.
And you reverse the pressure on your membrane once you ' ve cooked it . Pop it out.
That ' s next year ' s Yves Klein , you know , eyeglasses shape.
This is something that my people at SQUID Labs are working on at the moment , called  " electronic rope. " 
So this is now a rope that knows the load on the rope at any particular point in the rope.
One thing I ' m really interested about this right now is , how , if you ' re really taking this view of the universe as a computer , how do we make things in a very general sense , and how might we share the way we make things in a general sense the same way you share open source hardware ? 
But they can show you how to build things in sequence.
And if you ' ve seen Amy Smith , she talks about how you get students at MIT to work with communities in Haiti.
Interesting things like that.
But it ' s definitely an interesting new worldview.
So this is actually a 3,000-square-foot kite , which also happens to be a minimal energy surface.
So that ' s a kite the size of your house.
You could just hang it as a bed sheet , but again , the computation of all the physics gives you the aerodynamic shape.
architecture,cities,collaboration,design,energy,environment,green,technology
We ' re understanding , in fact , that those of us who live in the developed world need to be really pushing towards eliminating our emissions.
And I think this is what we ' ve done with climate change.
That shouldn ' t be news to any of us.
In order to provide the kind of energy that it would take for eight billion people living in cities that are even somewhat like the cities that those of us in the global North live in today , we would have to generate an absolutely astonishing amount of energy.
Every city determines to a very large extent the amount of energy used by its inhabitants.
Basically , we substitute , in our lives , access to the things we want.
And since the most sustainable trip is the one that you never had to make in the first place , suddenly our lives become instantly more sustainable.
Urban retrofitting : creating different sorts of spaces and uses out of places that are already there.
So you can think of it as tent poles that actually raise the density of the entire city.
We have the manufacture of the car , the disposal of the car , all of the parking and freeways and so on.
People are saying that it ' s moving from the idea of the dream home to the dream neighborhood.
Some of it is about walking . It ' s not all perfect yet.
But the technologies are getting better , and we ' re starting to really kind of crowdsource this navigation.
What we ' re finding is that what we want is access to the capacities of things.
And so what we do is we buy these drills that have a potential capacity of thousands of hours of drill time , use them once or twice to put a hole in the wall and let them sit.
We ' re finding that people can share the same spaces , do stuff with vacant space.
We cool them with breezes . We heat them with sunshine.
Now when we look at being able to slash our product use , slash our transportation use , slash our building energy use , all of that is great , but it still leaves something behind.
And certainly lots of people have taken to heart this idea that a sustainable city is covered in greenery.
Do they , for instance , capture rainwater so that we can reduce water use ? 
Do they allow for pollination , pollinator pathways that bees and butterflies and such can come back into our cities ? 
And if we have another eight billion or seven billion , or six billion , even , people , living on a planet where their cities also steal the future , we ' re going to run out of future really fast.
business,culture,global issues,media,violence,war
During the twentieth century , we witnessed the atrocities of Stalin , Hitler , Mao , Pol Pot , Rwanda and other genocides , and even though the twenty-first century is only seven years old , we have already witnessed an ongoing genocide in Darfur and the daily horrors of Iraq.
Now , in the decade of Darfur and Iraq , a statement like that might seem somewhere between hallucinatory and obscene . But I ' m going to try to convince you that that is the correct picture . The decline of violence is a fractal phenomenon . You can see it over millennia , over centuries , over decades and over years , although there seems to have been a tipping point at the onset of the Age of Reason in the sixteenth century . One sees it all over the world , although not homogeneously.
The red bars correspond to the likelihood that a man will die at the hands of another man , as opposed to passing away of natural causes , in a variety of foraging societies in the New Guinea Highlands and the Amazon Rainforest.
Also in the Bible , one sees that the death penalty was the accepted punishment for crimes such as homosexuality , adultery , blasphemy , idolatry , talking back to your parents -- -- and picking up sticks on the Sabbath.
There were numerous ingenious forms of sadistic capital punishment : burning at the stake , disemboweling , breaking on the wheel , being pulled apart by horses and so on.
He plotted on a logarithmic scale , going from 100 deaths per 100,000 people per year , which was approximately the rate of homicide in the Middle Ages . And the figure plummets down to less than one homicide per 100,000 people per year in seven or eight European countries . Then , there is a slight uptick in the 1960s . The people who said that rock  ' n '  roll would lead to the decline of moral values actually had a grain of truth to that.
And , as you can see , the death rate goes down from 65,000 deaths per conflict per year in the 1950s to less than 2,000 deaths per conflict per year in this decade , as horrific as it is.
President Clinton , if you ' re here , thank you.
Things that we read about in the paper with gory footage burn into memory more than reports of a lot more people dying in their beds of old age . There are dynamics in the opinion and advocacy markets : no one ever attracted observers , advocates and donors by saying things just seem to be getting better and better.
Well , why has violence declined ?  No one really knows , but I have read four explanations , all of which , I think , have some grain of plausibility . The first is , maybe Thomas Hobbes got it right . He was the one who said that life in a state of nature was  " solitary , poor , nasty , brutish and short. "  Not because , he argued , humans have some primordial thirst for blood or aggressive instinct or territorial imperative , but because of the logic of anarchy . In a state of anarchy , there ' s a constant temptation to invade your neighbors preemptively , before they invade you . More recently , Thomas Schelling gives the analogy of a homeowner who hears a rustling in the basement . Being a good American , he has a pistol in the nightstand , pulls out his gun , and walks down the stairs.
Hunter-gatherer peoples explicitly go through this train of thought , and will often raid their neighbors out of fear of being raided first.
Life becomes an episode of  " The Sopranos. "  Hobbes '  solution , the  " Leviathan, "  was that if authority for the legitimate use of violence was vested in a single democratic agency -- a leviathan -- then such a state can reduce the temptation of attack , because any kind of aggression will be punished , leaving its profitability as zero . That would remove the temptation to invade preemptively , out of fear of them attacking you first.
The second explanation is that in many times and places , there is a widespread sentiment that life is cheap.
Wright argues that technology has increased the number of positive-sum games that humans tend to be embroiled in , by allowing the trade of goods , services and ideas over longer distances and among larger groups of people.
And there are a number of possibilities , such as increasing circles of reciprocity in the sense that Robert Wright argues for.
Because we have been doing something right , and it sure would be good to find out what it is.
Steven Pinker : Very much . It would fit both in Wright ' s theory , that it allows us to enjoy the benefits of cooperation over larger and larger circles . But also , I think it helps us imagine what it ' s like to be someone else . I think when you read these horrific tortures that were common in the Middle Ages , you think , how could they possibly have done it , how could they have not have empathized with the person that they ' re disemboweling ?  But clearly , as far as they ' re concerned , this is just an alien being that does not have feelings akin to their own . Anything , I think , that makes it easier to imagine trading places with someone else means that it increases your moral consideration to that other person.
HIV is a serious problem in the DR Congo , and aid agencies have flooded the country with free and cheap condoms . But few people are using them . Why ?   " Reformed marketer "  Amy Lockwood offers a surprising answer that upends a traditional model of philanthropy.
I am a reformed marketer , and I now work in international development.
In the past 10 years , five million people have died due to a war in the east.
This might not sound like a large number , but in a country with 76 million people , it means there are 930,000 that are infected.
Damien runs a hotel outside of Kinshasa.
He said there ' s just not in demand.
And as a marketer , I found that curious.
They package it with the red ribbon that reminds us of HIV , put it in boxes that remind you who paid for them , show pictures of your wife or husband and tell you to protect them or to act prudently.
And the private companies that sell condoms in these places , they understand this.
And this made me think that perhaps the donor agencies had just missed out on a key aspect of marketing : understanding who ' s the audience.
And so the lesson is this : it doesn ' t really matter what you ' re selling ; you just have to think about who is your customer , and what are the messages that are going to get them to change their behavior.

Does your mindset correspond to my dataset ? 
 " Oh , it ' s very easy . It ' s the western world and it ' s the developing world, "  they say.
But then you know , I press them like this.
And I like that definition , because it enabled me to transfer their mindset into the dataset.
Exactly what the students said was their concept about the world.
And the students were right . It wasn ' t that the world consisted -- the world consisted here , of one set of countries over here , which had large families and short life . Developing world.
Then the developing countries applied soap and water , vaccination.
But some countries remain back in this area here.
So the problem I had is that the worldview that my students had corresponds to reality in the world the year their teachers were born.
Here we go.
This great nation , Mexico , has the problem that arms are coming from North , across the borders , so they had to stop that , because they have this strange relationship to the United States , you know.
By the way , I ' m teaching you how to use our website , Gapminder World , while I ' m correcting this , because this is a free utility on the net.
And now I have income per person on this axis.
This is instead of studying history for one year at university.
Here we come . And that was the influenza.
Look here You have China over there , you have India over there , and this is what has happened.
Because in fact , this is child labor . My son and his wife sat in a closet for many years and developed this.
Whereas when my oldest son , who works for Google , he should develop by quarter , or by half-year.
But this was 1963.
And Asia could have social development before they got the economic development.
But the middle income countries -- and this is where I suggest to my students , stop using the concept  " developing world. " 
We could actually go to Mayflower to Eisenhower , and that would be put together into a developing world , which is rightly growing its cities in a very amazing way , which have great entrepreneurs , but also have the collapsing countries.
These people go to bed hungry.
And this is how the world changed.
And I come now , into projections , but I have to stop at the door of Lehman Brothers there , you know , because -- that ' s where the projections are not valid any longer.
We have the high income countries here , with the United States as a leading power ; we have the emerging economies in the middle , which provide a lot of the funding for the bailout ; and we have the low income countries here.
We have all this at the same time.
And you have huge differences within countries also.
And on this , heath , child survival , and it doesn ' t come as a surprise that Africa south of Sahara is at the bottom.
And I can split the others . Here is the South Asian , Arab world.
We cannot put it into two parts.
And then it ' s United States today , up here.
And it is my task , on behalf of the rest of the world , to convey a thanks to the U.S . taxpayers , for Demographic Health Survey.
And it is U.S . government at its best , without advocacy , providing facts , that it ' s useful for the society.
And they are highly skilled professionals.
And I ' m not paid to come here , no.
And what has happened in the world ? 
And the blue former developing countries are mixing up with the former industrialized western world.
Well , MDG 4.
Let ' s see what Sweden has done.
Same child mortality as Bangladesh had , 1990 , though they had lower income.
I run Sweden the same 16 year period.
5.5 percent . They are faster than the millennium development goal.
The middle income countries , the emerging economy , they are catching up.
We have to do real-time competition. " 
And here we go . It took a little time for them to get independent.
We never thought it would happen that they would win over Sweden!
Not simplistic extrapolation.
This is dollar per person . This is HIV in the countries.
About 20 percent of the adult population are infected.
There ' s a number , five to 10 countries in Africa that has the same level as Sweden and United States.
But now it ' s not falling , because there , with help from PEPFAR , it ' s working with treatment . And people are not dying.
And it ' s not the economy . Richer country has a little higher.
And this is the situation you see.
So to just end up , there are things of suffering in the one billion poorest , which we don ' t know.
It ' s similar to the pellagra epidemic in Mississippi in the  ' 30s.
This is the epidemic in Mozambique . This is an epidemic in northern Tanzania.
And over the last two years , 2,000 people has been crippled in the southern tip of Bandundu region.
Don ' t get confused of the progress of the emerging economies and the great capacity of people in the middle income countries and in peaceful low income countries.
They are still as poor as they ' ve ever been.
So you have a very bad name , State Department . This is not the State Department.
Author Robert Wright explains  " non-zero-sumness "  -- the network of linked fortunes and cooperation that has guided our evolution to this point -- and how we can use it to help save humanity today.
I ' ve got apparently 18 minutes to convince you that history has a direction , an arrow ; that in some fundamental sense , it ' s good ; that the arrow points to something positive.
And to be honest , if I had known when I was asked to give this upbeat talk that even as I was giving the upbeat talk , the apocalypse would be unfolding -- -- I might have said ,  " Is it okay if I talk about something else ?  " 
I ' ll see what I can do . OK ? 
Because what happened in the beginning , this stuff encases itself in a cell , then cells start hanging out together in societies.
By cultural evolution we mean the evolution of ideas.
Next best thing to a video game.
I ' m sorry -- it was a cheap laugh , but I wanted to find a way to transition back to this idea of the unfolding apocalypse , and I thought that might do it.
Stonehenge is the remnant of a chiefdom , which is what you get with the invention of agriculture : multi-village polity with centralized rule.
So you had social complexity spanning the whole continent , even if no polity did similarly . Today , you ' ve got nation states.
Now , I explained this growth of complexity by reference to something called  " non-zero sumness. " 
It ' s either for the better or for the worse , OK.
Social structure adapts to accommodate this possibility and to harness this productive potential , so you get cities , you know , and you get all the non-zero-sum games you don ' t think about that are being played across the world.
First of all , it can accommodate ; it doesn ' t deny the existence of inequality exploitation war.
And a testament to this is the thing that most amazes me , most impresses me , and most uplifts me , which is that there is a moral dimension to history ; there is a moral arrow . We have seen moral progress over time.
And you have to read your ancient history to realize what a revolution that has been , OK . This was not a prevalent view , few thousand years ago , and I attribute it to this non-zero-sum dynamic.
Unfortunately , I don ' t fly trans-Atlantic business class often enough to know , or any other kind of business class really , but I assume that in business class , you don ' t hear many expressions of , you know , bigotry about racial groups or ethnic groups , because the people who are flying trans-Atlantic business class are doing business with all these people ; they ' re making money off all these people . And I really do think that , in that sense at least , capitalism has been a constructive force , and more fundamentally , it ' s a non-zero-sumness that has been a constructive force in expanding people ' s realm of moral awareness . I think the non-zero-sum dynamic , which is not only economic by any means -- it ' s not always commerce -- but it has driven us to the verge of a moral truth , which is the fundamental equality of everyone . It has done that.
And you may wonder , OK , that ' s all fine , sounds great -- moral direction in history -- but what about this so-called clash of civilizations ?  Well , first of all , I would emphasize that it fits into the non-zero-sum framework , OK . If you look at the relationship between the so-called Muslim world and Western world -- two terms I don ' t like , but can ' t really avoid ; in such a short span of time , they ' re efficient if nothing else -- it is non-zero-sum . And by that I mean , if people in the Muslim world get more hateful , more resentful , less happy with their place in the world , it ' ll be bad for the West . If they get more happy , it ' ll be good for the West.
And one reason is because of something I call the  " growing lethality of hatred. " 
And there ' s something I worry about especially , which is that this dynamic will lead to a kind of a feedback cycle that puts us on a slippery slope.
You could call this the positive feedback of negative vibes , but I think in something so spooky , we really shouldn ' t have the word positive there at all , even in a technical sense.
I have a whole global governance sermon that I will spare you right now , because I don ' t think that ' s going to be enough anyway , although it ' s essential.
It sounds so kind of Pollyannaish . I feel like Rodney King , you know , saying , why can ' t we all just get along ? 
In my defense , I ' d say , as naive as this may sound , it ' s ultimately grounded in cynicism.
We will see the further evolution of this kind of business-class morality.
I never called myself Mr . Uplift.
And I think the answer is a lot of different people are going to have to do a lot of different things.
Because to understand why somebody in a very different culture does something -- somebody you ' re kind of viewing as alien , who ' s doing things you consider strange in a culture you consider strange -- to really understand why they do the things they do is a morally redeeming accomplishment , because you ' ve got to relate their experience to yours.
It ' s especially hard to do when people hate you , OK , because you don ' t really , in a sense , want to completely understand why people hate you.
The reason you ' re trying to understand why they hate us , is to get them to quit hating us . The idea when you go through this moral exercise of really coming to appreciate their humanity and better understand them , is part of an effort to get them to appreciate your humanity in the long run.
Now , the good news is that the person who said it was Ann Coulter.
So I ' m not really worried about it . So -- -- I mean , we ' re going to have to work on a lot of fronts , but if we succeed -- if we succeed -- then once again , non-zero-sumness and the recognition of non-zero-sum dynamics will have forced us to a higher moral level.
 " Yahweh is our Savior "  means  " He has saved the nation of Israel, "  which at the time , was a pretty high-level social organization.
Martin Seligman talks about psychology -- as a field of study and as it works one-on-one with each patient and each practitioner . As it moves beyond a focus on disease , what can modern psychology help us to become ? 
When I was president of the American Psychological Association , they tried to media-train me , and an encounter I had with CNN summarizes what I ' m going to be talking about today , which is the eleventh reason to be optimistic.
And she said ,  " But this is CNN , so you only get a sound bite. " 
 " Good. " 
Doctor Seligman , what is the state of psychology today ?  " 
This time you can have three words.
And by parallel summary , I want to say the same thing about technology , about entertainment and design , because I think the issues are very similar.
And because , quite rightly , they were saying psychology is about finding what ' s wrong with you . Spot the loony.
And the other thing that happened is that a science developed , a science of mental illness.
We could look across time at the same people -- people , for example , who were genetically vulnerable to schizophrenia -- and ask what the contribution of mothering , of genetics are , and we could isolate third variables by doing experiments on the mental illnesses.
And I think that ' s terrific . I ' m proud of it.
We forgot responsibility . That was the first cost.
No one works on that.
The first is that psychology should be just as concerned with human strength as it is with weakness.
So in the last 10 years and the hope for the future , we ' ve seen the beginnings of a science of positive psychology , a science of what makes life worth living.
We created the opposite of the diagnostic manual of the insanities : a classification of the strengths and virtues that looks at the sex ratio , how they ' re defined , how to diagnose them , what builds them and what gets in their way.
And how do they differ from the rest of us ? 
They don ' t sit in seminars on Saturday morning.
And I ' m going to suggest to you that ' s not nearly enough , in just a moment.
That is , which ones actually make people lastingly happier ? 
And I believe there are three different -- and I call them different because different interventions build them , it ' s possible to have one rather than the other -- three different happy lives.
That ' s what Aristotle was talking about.
But the pleasant life has three drawbacks , and it ' s why positive psychology is not happy-ology and why it doesn ' t end here.
It ' s all like French vanilla ice cream , the first taste is a 100 percent ; by the time you ' re down to the sixth taste , it ' s gone.
In two of the three great arenas of life , by the time Len was 30 , Len was enormously successful . The first arena was work.
But in the third great arena of life , love , Len is an abysmal failure.
And Len was wealthy enough to be able to afford a Park Avenue psychoanalyst , who for five years tried to find the sexual trauma that had somehow locked positive emotion inside of him.
Contrary to what psychology told us about the bottom 50 percent of the human race in positive affectivity , I think Len is one of the happiest people I know.
And this is indeed what Mike Csikszentmihalyi has been talking about , about flow . And it ' s distinct from pleasure in a very important way.
You have intense concentration.
And then re-crafting your life to use them as much as you possibly can.
She ' s working her way through college.
What you get out of that is not smiley-ness.
The second path is eudaimonian flow.
I mentioned that for all three kinds of lives , the pleasant life , the good life , the meaningful life , people are now hard at work on the question , are there things that lastingly change those lives ? 
So we do random assignment , placebo controlled , long-term studies of different interventions.
Gratitude visit . I want you all to do this with me now , if you would.
Now , OK , you can open your eyes.
Another example is a strength date , in which we get couples to identify their highest strengths on the strengths test , and then to design an evening in which they both use their strengths , and we find this is a strengthener of relationships.
And what you find is when you do something fun , it has a square wave walk set.
And this is really what you ' re about . And that ' s our target variable.
It turns out the pursuit of pleasure has almost no contribution to life satisfaction.
Which is to say , the full life -- the sum is greater than the parts , if you ' ve got all three.
Is health a function of positive engagement , of pleasure , and of meaning in life ? 
But I found that the problems of psychology seemed to be parallel to the problems of technology , entertainment and design in the following way.
I thought , when I first became a therapist 30 years ago , that if I was good enough to make someone not depressed , not anxious , not angry , that I ' d make them happy.
And so , the parallel thing holds with technology , entertainment and design , I believe.
So in conclusion , the eleventh reason for optimism , in addition to the space elevator , is that I think with technology , entertainment and design , we can actually increase the amount of tonnage of human happiness on the planet.
http://www.ted.com/talks/andrew_mwenda_takes_a_new_look_at_africa.html
Andrew Mwenda takes a new look at Africa
Every single thing I planned to say , they have said it here , and it looks and sounds like I have nothing else to say.
It is the G8 Summit.
Its largest recipients were Germany and France , and it was only 2.5 percent of their GDP.
By displaying despair , helplessness and hopelessness , the media is telling the truth about Africa , and nothing but the truth.
Africa has 53 nations.
It appeals to pity . It appeals to something called charity.
We should deliver medicines to those who are ill.
But equally , it has opportunities and a lot of potential.
It should be a challenge of creating wealth.
Sending somebody to school and giving them medicines , ladies and gentlemen , does not create wealth for them.
But they also succeed at the job of entrepreneurship.
Support research institutions , because knowledge is an important part of wealth creation.
Ladies and gentlemen , can any one of you tell me a neighbor , a friend , a relative that you know , who became rich by receiving charity ? 
Well , since I ' m not seeing the hand , it appears that what I ' m stating is true.
External actors can only present to you an opportunity.
Why ?  Because we lack the internal , institutional framework and policy framework that can make it possible for us to benefit from our external relations . I ' ll give you an example.
We import 50,000 metric tons of sugar from Brazil and Cuba.
And all forms of intervention need support , the evolution of the kinds of institutions that create wealth , the kinds of institutions that increase productivity.
Money is needed for a simple thing like keeping law and order.
Why should people support their government ? 
To get legitimacy , governments often need to deliver things like primary education , primary health , roads , build hospitals and clinics.
The problem with the African continent and the problem with the aid industry is that it has distorted the structure of incentives facing the governments in Africa.
Why ?  Because the knowledge that is required for you to understand the incentives necessary to expand a business -- it requires that you listen to the people , the private sector actors in that industry.
The IMF , the World Bank , and the cartel of good intentions in the world has taken over our rights as citizens , and therefore what our governments are doing , because they depend on aid , is to listen to international creditors rather than their own citizens.
The mistake of the international aid industry is to pick these isolated incidents of success , generalize them , pour billions and trillions of dollars into them , and then spread them across the whole world , ignoring the specific and unique circumstances in a given village , the skills , the practices , the norms and habits that allowed that small aid project to succeed -- like in Sauri village , in Kenya , where Jeffrey Sachs is working -- and therefore generalize this experience as the experience of everybody.
Governments are not changing it . Why ? 
I also want to say that it is important for us to note that , over the last 50 years , Africa has been receiving increasing aid from the international community , in the form of technical assistance , and financial aid , and all other forms of aid.
In the 2006-2007 budget , expected revenue : 2.5 trillion shillings.
Why does the government of Uganda budget spend 110 percent of its own revenue ? 
The military , 380 billion.
There you go . 70 cabinet ministers , 114 presidential advisers , by the way , who never see the president , except on television.
There were 56 , and when our president wanted to amend the constitution and remove term limits , he had to create 25 new districts , and now there are 81.
A recent government of Uganda study found that there are 3,000 four-wheel drive motor vehicles at the Minister of Health headquarters.
It should be short enough to arouse interest , but long enough to cover the subject.
The photo director for National Geographic , David Griffin knows the power of photography to connect us to our world . In a talk filled with glorious images , he talks about how we all use photos to tell our stories.
Let ' s just start by looking at some great photographs.
This is a jet landing at San Francisco , by Bruce Dale.
I love this photograph because it reminds me of Degas '  bronze sculptures of the little dancer.
Shot straight down , so these are the shadows of the camels.
And David said that there was lot of weird stuff happening on the dance floor.
And finally , the bow of the Titanic , without movie stars , photographed by Emory Kristof.
But I turned away for a moment , and he got caught into a riptide and started to be pulled out towards the jetty.
I can see his hands reaching out , and I can see his face in terror , looking at me , saying ,  " Help me , Dad. " 
But this flashbulb memory , as it ' s called , is when all the elements came together to define not just the event , but my emotional connection to it.
I remember my image of you was that you were up on the shore yelling at me. " 
Last year , we added a section to our website called  " Your Shot, "  where anyone can submit photographs for possible publication.
But to be a great photojournalist , you have to have more than just one or two great photographs in you.
So I ' m going to share with you some coverages that I feel demonstrate the storytelling power of photography.
This is a serval cat.
Nick -- the camera , again , an automatic camera took thousands of pictures of this.
I love this little bit of water that comes off the back of his tail.
It was with the elephants that this story pivoted.
But once the annual rains began , the herd would begin migrating to feeding grounds outside the park.
Annie had been killed , along with 20 members of her herd.
But what Nick did was he brought back a story that went beyond the old-school method of just straight ,  " Isn ' t this an amazing world ?  " 
Sometimes you can tell a broad story in a focused way.
Jonas Bendiksen , a very energetic photographer , came to me and said ,  " We need to document this , and here ' s my proposal.
What Jonas did was not just go and do a surface look at the awful conditions that exist in such places.
Sometimes , though , the only way to tell a story is with a sweeping picture.
I ' ve seen sort of OK pictures of bycatch , the animals accidentally scooped up while fishing for a specific species.
And here in China , Randy shot a jellyfish market.
We also want to look for solutions.
It is like a tube where a wounded soldier enters on one end and exits back home , on the other.
The soldier on the right has the name of his daughter tattooed across his chest , as a reminder of home.
Jim took what could have been a straight-up medical science story and gave it a human dimension that touched our readers deeply.
They have been rarely photographed , partly because they are considered one of the most dangerous predators in the ocean.
You know of  " The March of the Penguins. " 
But then Paul got in the water.
So , she is pretty significant in size.
Then Paul thinks that she simply took pity on him.
She ' d kind of look at him , like  " What are you doing ?  " 
Eventually , though , Paul thinks that she just figured that he was never going to survive.
It is these kinds of stories , ones that go beyond the immediate or just the superficial that demonstrate the power of photojournalism.
art,computers,design,film,technology,visualizations
And one of the reasons it is so difficult is that , unlike aliens and dinosaurs , we look at human faces every day.
And we ' re going to try to do a photo-real face of an actress named Emily O ' Brien , who is right there.
This is a face-scanning sphere , with 156 white LEDs all around that allow us to photograph her in a series of very controlled illumination conditions.
If we zoom in on this photograph right here , we can see it ' s a really nice photograph to have of her , because she is lit from absolutely everywhere at the same time to get a nice image of her facial texture.
I don ' t think any photograph like this had ever been taken before we had done this.
So , if we use information that comes off of this specular reflection , we can go from a traditional face scan that might have the gross contours of the face and the basic shape , and augment it with information that puts in all of that skin pore structure and fine wrinkles.
If you take a look at these scans that we have of Emily , you can see that the human face does an enormous amount of amazing things as it goes into different facial expressions.
You can see muscles pulling down at flesh to bring her eyebrows down.
Then , instead of looking like a plaster mannequin , it actually looks like it ' s made out of living human flesh.
And , in addition to the coarse-scale geometry , they also used all of that detail to create a set of what are called  " displacement maps "  that animate as well.
We actually used one of her own performances to provide the source data.
Emily : Image Metrics is a markerless , performance-driven animation company.
Paul Debevec : So , if we break that down into layers , here ' s that diffuse component we saw in the first slide.
And that is Emily herself.
And let ' s take a look at a computer-generated version of Bruce , running in a new environment.
Africa,activism,animals,biodiversity,biosphere,war
I start speaking English , learning English , about a year ago.
But what I ' ve been doing -- when I was about 14 , I grew in my uncle ' s house.
Around 17 to 20 years , I became , myself , a poacher.
And for three to four years , I went to university.
And I said ,  " No way , I ' m not doing it.
I say ,  " Oh , no , I continue. " 
That time the Ituri Forest was created as a forest reserve with some animals and also plants.
And it has been named Okapi Faunal Reserve because of this beautiful creature.
It has also some beautiful primates.
I was appointed as a teaching assistant at my university because I accomplished with honor.
And the work we have been doing was completely difficult to do and to achieve it.
So they might go through , pass through the Okapi Faunal Reserve.
Torture , wars -- oh , my God , you can ' t believe.
They were killing people . They were doing whatever they want because they have power.
But I was from the west , working in the east.
And I was from the same area to him.
I can ' t go back to my area -- it ' s more than 1,000 kilometers [away].
Purpose : so that we start them for agriculture , for medicine , for whatever , and for science , for the study of the flora and the change of the forest.
And with soldiers , they went to the forest for poaching elephants.
And what I did , I gave him just antibiotics that we care for tuberculosis.
And what of important things -- I think all of you here have a cell phone.
And some of equipment went with them , on the top of the canopy , to save it.
And after that , we succeeded.
With friends , we had been sitting and watching match football , and having some good music with WorldSpace radio , when it started , I think.
And the reserve was a target to the rebels.
Poaching -- oh , no way.
So we went to meet them.
But they said ,  " You guys , you think that soldiers who are dying are not important , and your animals you are protecting are most important.
We started talking with them and I was negotiating.
Sometimes we are having meeting and they are talking with Jean-Pierre Bemba , Sometimes , they talk to my own language , that is , Lingala.
I had only this equipment -- my satellite phone , my computer and a plastic solar panel -- that I hide it in the forest.
They started suspecting that what we do on the morning , and the afternoon , it ' s on the news , BBC , RFI.
One day , we went to meet the Chief Commander.
I don ' t know. " 
So I was scared.
Because there was no way -- whatever they do , it ' s known the same time.
This is the only trouser and shirt remind me of this.
And I was mad.
What we are doing after that -- that was the situation of the war -- we have to rebuild.
I started this with 70 dollars , and start fundraising money to where I ' ve been going.
And also , what one of the speciality we are doing , my design is tracking the global warming effect on biodiversity , and what the impacts of the Ituri Forest is playing to uptake carbon.
This is a very embarrassing talk , I know.
Where are you people ? 
Everybody is happy , but see what it ' s doing , see what is going in Darfur.
I don ' t think that someone may blame Google , because it ' s doing the right things , even if people like Al-Qaeda are using Google to connect between them.
Chris Anderson : Thank you , thank you.
How can we help you ? 
I did it myself.
What you can assist us , it ' s by building capacities.
And they can ' t go even to university.

Bill Stone : Exploring deep caves
One of the things that ' s changed here , in the last 150 years since Jules Verne had great science-fiction concepts of what the underworld was like , is that technology has enabled us to go to these places that were previously completely unknown and speculated about.
And a lot of people ask me , you know , what kind of people do you get for a project like this ? 
But we also value esprit de corps and the ability to diplomatically resolve inter-personal conflict while under great stress in remote locations.
We ' re roughly two days from the entrance at that point.
Otherwise it is completely dark in these places.
So I ' ve got a very brief clip here that was taken in the late 1980s.
Along that same line , I have to tell you that with the spate of Hollywood movies that came out last year , we have never seen monsters underground -- at least the kind that eat you.
The lead crews will be underground for pushing 30 days straight.
And when you used to find these things , they would put a label on a map that said terminal siphon.
This is some life-support equipment closed-cycle.
So it makes you think about how to design your equipment for long range , away from a safe haven.
To experience it is a privilege.
This gadget you see right here was called the digital wall mapper , and it produced the first three-dimensional map anybody has ever done of a cave , and it happened to be underwater in Wakulla Springs.
This is one of the places where planetary scientists believe there is a highest probability of the detection of the first life off earth in the ocean that exists below there.
It has to be smart enough to avoid terrain hazards and to find a good landing site on the ice.
The ice could be anywhere from three to 16 miles deep.
BS : What Jim didn ' t know when he released that movie was that six months earlier NASA had funded a team I assembled to develop a prototype for the Europa AUV.
This is the target site , the world ' s deepest hydrothermal spring at Cenote Zacaton in northern Mexico.
One is , how do you do science autonomy underground ? 
We move along the wall , in what ' s called proximity operations , looking for changes in color.
No hands at the wheel.
Its sensor beams look both forward and backward at the same time , allowing it to do new exploration while it ' s still achieving geometric sensor-lock on what it ' s gone through already.
What then of manned space exploration ? 
Something fundamental has to change if we are to see common access to space in our lifetime.
One of them is the requirement for economical earth-to-space transport.
Orbital hotels to start with , but workshops for the rest of us later on.
Now , to give you a chance to understand why there is power in that statement , I ' ve got to give you the basics of Space 101.
That ' s more than you pay for TED , if Google dropped their sponsorship.
So , what if you could get your gas at a 10th the price ? 
And the most amazing thing that came out of that mission was a strong hydrogen signature at Shackleton crater on the south pole of the moon.
The way you normally build a system right now is you have a tube stack that has to be launched from the ground , and resist all kinds of aerodynamic forces.
This is an idea that , again , came out of Livermore back in 1989 , with Dr . Lowell Wood ' s group.
We can build space tugs , orbiting platforms for holding cryogens and water.
You got two choices.
It ' s risky and it ' s going to be one hell of a ride -- better than Disney.
This is not like that . I ' m much more like Scotty.
That ' s not true.
The orbital refueling stations I ' ve just described could create an entirely new industry and provide the final key for opening space to the general exploration.
I would like to close here by putting a stake in the sand at TED.
There was once a time when people did bold things to open the frontier.
http://www.ted.com/talks/amy_tan_on_creativity.html
Amy Tan on creativity
And I ' m gonna try and do that within the 18-minute time span that we were told to stay within , and to follow the TED commandments : that is , actually , something that creates a near-death experience , but near-death is good for creativity.
When I say we , I don ' t mean you , necessarily ; I mean me , and my right brain , my left brain and the one that ' s in between that is the censor and tells me what I ' m saying is wrong.
And some people would say that we ' re born with it in some other means.
And I will mention that I actually developed temporal lobe seizures a number of years ago , but it was during the time I was writing my last book , and some people say that book is quite different.
And I had a miniature poodle.
And then , I also wasn ' t really shining in a certain area that I wanted to be , and you know , you look at those scores , and it wasn ' t bad , but it was not certainly predictive that I would one day make my living out of the artful arrangement of words.
I have some ones that were long lasting : from the age of five to 15 , this was supposed to be my side occupation , and it led to a sense of failure.
My father was a Baptist minister , and he believed in miracles , and that God ' s will would take care of that.
There was a reason for everything.
You become very creative , in a survival sense.
And the one my mother asked : how do I make things happen ? 
And it ' s also one that , I think , many of our scientists have been asking.
And I got a lot of them during what ' s been going on throughout this conference , almost everything that ' s been going on.
There ' s a lot of unknown , and you often don ' t know what it is except by its absence.
And this happens constantly in the writing.
Now , I don ' t want to ignore the other side of what happens in our universe , like many of our scientists have.
And I would link that to something called the cosmological constant.
It was something I read in an editorial by a woman who was talking about the war in Iraq . And she said ,  " Save a man from drowning , you are responsible to him for life. " 
And it ' s what Buddhist fishermen say , because they ' re not supposed to kill anything.
And it was a warning -- don ' t get involved in other people ' s business , or you ' re going to get stuck.
And then we have intentions.
What are we supposed to do ? 
I got these hints everywhere.
And when I have the question , it is a focus.
And it may also be explained that now you have a focus.
Your brother , who ' s fallen in trouble , do you take care of him ? 
And then , after a while , I had to ask myself ,  " Why do we take on knowledge , why do we take on assumptions that other people have given us ?  " 
We come to this point and say , what do I as an individual do ? 
When I look at all these things that are morally ambiguous and uncomfortable , and I consider what my intentions should be , I realize it goes back to this identity question that I had when I was a child -- and why am I here , and what is the meaning of my life , and what is my place in the universe ? 
Sometimes I get help from the universe , it seems.
There are also things , quite uncanny , which bring me information that will help me in the writing of the book.
You wonder , are these things random chance ? 
These are the things I constantly think about from day to day.
Another chance encounter is when I went to a place -- I just was with some friends , and we drove randomly to a different place , and we ended up in this non-tourist location , a beautiful village , pristine.
And I didn ' t know exactly why I had it , but it was so vivid.
And he said ,  " Well , I guess with everything in life , there ' s a place of balance. " 
Or is it a kind of serendipity that we cannot explain , like the cosmological constant ? 
And how are we going to assign what the responsibility and the causes are , outside of a court of law ? 
And I said yes , about this village of singing people , singing minority.
The man ' s sons were banished to live three kilometers away , in a cowshed.
It takes a while , but I have to let go of them and just go there , and be there.
Now you , as Westerners , and I , as Westerners , would say well , that ' s superstition . But after being there for a while , and seeing the amazing things that happened , you begin to wonder whose beliefs are those that are in operation in the world , determining how things happen.
It is in the hands of readers , and they interpret it differently.
I believe in specifics , the specifics of story , and the past , the specifics of that past , and what is happening in the story at that point.
And that is how I find particles of truth , not the absolute truth , or the whole truth.
And if there is a partial answer , a more complete answer from me , it is to simply imagine.
I have to become the story in order to understand a lot of that.

Seth Godin on standing out
Now , before sliced bread was invented in the 1910s I wonder what they said ? 
And the reason is that until Wonder came along and figured out how to spread the idea of sliced bread , no one wanted it.
I think that all this stuff applies to everybody regardless of what we do.
But I want you to forgive me when I use these examples because I ' m talking about anything that you decide to spend your time to do.
The way the TV-industrial complex works , is you buy some ads -- interrupt some people -- that gets you distribution.
And that model of , and we heard it yesterday , if we could only get onto the homepage of Google , if we could only figure out how to get promoted there , if we could only figure out how to grab that person by the throat , and tell them about what we want to do.
And the thing that ' s happened is , they canceled the TV-industrial complex.
Right . I go to the deli ; I ' m sick ; I need to buy some medicine.
I buy the stuff in the yellow box because I always have.
Imagine what the world was like 40 years ago when it was just the Saturday Evening Post and Time and Newsweek.
I couldn ' t have written this better myself . It came out four days ago -- I circled the important parts so you can see them here.
The world revolves around me . Me , me , me , me , me . My favorite person -- me.
Part of the reason is -- they ' ve got way more choices than they used to , and way less time.
Who ' s going to stop and pull over and say -- oh , look , a cow . Nobody.
I mean , if all cows were purple you ' d get bored with those , too.
That two of the hottest cars in the United States is a 55,000-dollar giant car , big enough to hold a mini in its trunk.

How to understand that it ' s not about interrupting people with big full-page ads , or insisting on meetings with people.
This guy , Lionel Poilane , the most famous baker in the world -- he died two and a half months ago , and he was a hero of mine and a dear friend.
They didn ' t want to buy his bread . It didn ' t look like  " French bread. " 
What marketers used to do is make average products for average people.
It was all about going for the center.
These are the people who are obsessed with something.
They have something I call  " otaku "  -- it ' s a great Japanese word.
Talk to them and make it easy for them to tell their friends.
Krispy Kreme has figured this whole thing out.
They want to talk to the people who do , and maybe it ' ll spread.
It ' s really simple -- you sell to the people who are listening , and maybe , just maybe those people tell their friends.
They only sell them on their website.
Hard Candy nail polish , doesn ' t appeal to everybody , but to the people who love it , they talk about it like crazy.
They got this way by being remarkable , sometimes a little too remarkable.

http://www.ted.com/talks/brian_skerry_reveals_ocean_s_glory_and_horror.html
Brian Skerry reveals ocean ' s glory -- and horror
And after even 30 years of doing this , after 30 years of exploring the ocean , I never cease to be amazed at the extraordinary encounters that I have while I ' m at sea.
The first story that I did for National Geographic , where I recognized the ability to include environmental issues within a natural history coverage , was a story I proposed on harp seals.
But as I got more involved in the story , I realized that there were two big environmental issues I couldn ' t ignore.
This is an aerial picture that I made that shows the Gulf of St . Lawrence during harp seal season.
They only need 12 days from the moment they ' re born until they ' re on their own.
I read that last year the pup mortality rate was 100 percent in parts of the Gulf of St . Lawrence.
And with that , I saw the potential to begin doing other stories about ocean problems.
I thought this was going to be headline news in every media outlet , but it really wasn ' t , so I wanted to do a story that was a very different kind of underwater story.
These are the lions and tigers of the sea.
But the truth is we ' re way too efficient at catching them , and their stocks have collapsed worldwide.
We can ' t keep taking without expecting serious consequences as a result.
And as this assembly is towed through the water , the doors meet resistance with the ocean , and it opens the mouth of the net , and they place floats at the top and a lead line on the bottom.
This photograph I made of the fisherman holding the shrimp that he caught after towing his nets for one hour.
And to make that point even more visual , I swam under the shrimp boat and made this picture of the guy shoveling this bycatch into the sea as trash and photographed this cascade of death , you know , animals like guitarfish , bat rays , flounder , pufferfish , that only an hour before , were on the bottom of the ocean , alive , but now being thrown back as trash.
And with its huge pectoral fins and eyes still very visible , it struck me as sort of a crucifixion , if you will.
So I went to the Bahamas because there ' re very few places in the world where sharks are doing well these days , but the Bahamas seem to be a place where stocks were reasonably healthy , largely due to the fact that the government there had outlawed longlining several years ago.
But the one thing I definitely didn ' t want to do with this coverage was to continue to portray sharks as something like monsters.
I also searched on this story for the elusive great hammerhead , an animal that really hadn ' t been photographed much until maybe about seven or 10 years ago.
We don ' t know where they migrate to or from , where they mate , where they have their pups , and yet , hammerhead populations in the Atlantic have declined about 80 percent in the last 20 to 30 years.
Because this is a pelagic animal and it lives out in the deeper water , and because we weren ' t working on the bottom , I brought along a shark cage here , and my friend , shark biologist Wes Pratt is inside the cage.
This is a photo of a lemon shark pup , and it shows these animals where they live for the first two to three years of their lives in these protective mangroves.
But this is crucial habitat and it ' s where they spend the first two , three years of their lives , until they ' re big enough to go out on the rest of the reef.
This is the largest , widest-ranging , deepest-diving and oldest of all turtle species.
And today , they crawl out and see condominiums.
Only one in a thousand leatherback hatchlings will reach maturity.
I actually jumped in and photographed this , and with the fisherman ' s permission , I cut the turtle out , and it was able to swim free.
We have the Southern right whale that we see here and the North Atlantic right whale that we see here with a mom and calf off the coast of Florida.
You can see the coal burning plant in the background.
And those white markings are not natural markings.
And the other problem is they get hit by ships.
I went down there in the winter time.
They were in perfect condition , very fat and healthy , robust , no entanglement scars , the way they ' re supposed to look.
I settled on working in the country of New Zealand because New Zealand was rather progressive , and is rather progressive in terms of protecting their ocean.
For example , they hoped that certain species of fish like the New Zealand snapper would return because they had been fished to the brink of commercial extinction.
And that ' s because the urchins eat kelp.
Little blue cod swimming in for a dash of color.
And I was in a place that had only been protected about 20 years ago.
The ocean is , indeed , resilient and tolerant to a point , but we must be good custodians.
community,social change
This was my mental model of the world : exploding population , small planet ; it ' s going to lead to ugly things.
And the world ' s population expected to top out at something hopefully a bit less than 10 billion , late this century.
So a lot of economists look at declining population and expect to see stagnation , maybe depression.
Take away land speculation , price of land drops.
As wages increase that also lifts the burden on the poor and the working class.
All of the Western religions begin with the notion of Eden , and descend through a kind of profligate present to a very ugly future.
So why does this matter ? 
Fear for the future leads to some rash decisions.
http://www.ted.com/talks/willie_smits_restores_a_rainforest.html
Willie Smits restores a rainforest
That evening I came back to the market in the dark and I heard  " uhh , uhh, "  and sure enough I found a dying orangutan baby on a garbage heap.
She ' s now living in the jungle of Sungai Wain , and this is Matahari , her second son , which , by the way , is also the son of the second orangutan I rescued , Dodoy.
It ' s not good.
And those are the peat swamp forests on 20 meters of peat , the largest accumulation of organic material in the world.
I ' m not going to talk too long about it , but there are so many of the family of Uce , which are not so fortunate to live out there in the forest , that still have to go through that process.
No . Everyone should be able to follow this.
In 2002 we had about 50 percent of the people jobless there.
This was the poorest district in the whole province and it was a total extinction of wildlife.
The climate has changed . I will show you : no more flooding , no more fires.
So what happened here ?  We created a huge economic failure in this forest.
There are no trees left.
It was quite simple . If you ' ll look at the steps : we bought the land , we dealt with the fire , and then only , we started doing the reforestation by combining agriculture with forestry.
So we do the  " people , profit , planet "  principles , but we do it in addition to a sure legal status -- because if the forest belongs to the state , people say ,  " It belongs to me , it belongs to everyone. " 
And then you look at the outputs and you start measuring what comes out.
This is how it looks like in practice . We have this grass we want to get rid of.
It ' s an old temple-building technique from Japan but bamboo is very fire-susceptible.
So we plant the trees , we plant these pineapples and beans and ginger in between , to reduce the competition for the trees , the crop fertilizer . Organic material is useful for the agricultural crops , for the people , but also helps the trees . The farmers have free land , the system yields early income , the orangutans get healthy food and we can speed up ecosystem regeneration while even saving some money.
This is an area of about 50 million hectares.
April.
And once the soil gets dried , you ' re in a dry season -- you get cracks , oxygen goes in , flames come out and the problem starts all over again.
For three months , the automatic lights outside did not go off because it was that dark.
And you need the local people for that because these grasslands , once they start burning .. . It goes through it like a windstorm and you lose again the last bit of ash and nutrients to the first rainfall -- going to the sea killing off the coral reefs there.
These sugar palms turn out to be fire-resistant -- also flood-resistant , by the way -- and they provide a lot of income for local people.
You don ' t need to harvest [unclear] or any other of the crops.
And if you zoom in a bit you can see that all of this area is divided into strips that go over different types of soil , and we were actually monitoring , measuring every single tree in these 2,000 hectares , 5,000 acres.
But , it ' s more complicated . It ' s not that simple , and you have to work with the people.
And then we started planting -- only 1,000 trees a day.
We use indicator plants to look at what soil types , or what vegetables will grow , or what trees will grow here.
The nursery , in here , is quite different.
Can you imagine ? 
And then slowly , the trees start taking over , bringing in produce from the fruits , from the timber , from the fuel wood.
So this is after one year.
And three years later , 137 species of birds are living here.
Rainfall is up.
Those pictures we use to analyze how much carbon , how the forest is developing , and we can monitor every tree using satellite images through our cooperation.
So this is the Samboja Lestari area.
This nearby city of Balikpapan has a big problem with water ; it ' s 80 percent surrounded by seawater , and we have now a lot of intrusion there.
In the tropics , raindrops are not formed from ice crystals , which is the case in the temperate zones , you need the trees with [unclear] , chemicals that come out of the leaves of the trees that initiate the raindrops.
Let ' s look at the next year , and you can see that that trend is continuing.
When there are trade winds of course the effect disappears , but afterwards , as soon as the wind stabilizes , you see again that the rainfall peaks come back above this area.
But the real success of course , is our band -- because if a baby is born , we will play , so everyone ' s our family and you don ' t make trouble with your family.
And inside , we have this area for reforestation as a gene bank to keep all that material alive , because for the last 12 years not a single seedling of the tropical hardwood trees has grown up because the climatic triggers have disappeared.
And it has two nice fences of tropical hardwood trees -- you have the shade trees planted in year one , then you underplanted with the sugar palms , and you plant this thorny fence.
They have enough income for three families.
Like here , in Samboja Lestari , we divide that ring in groups of 20 families.
In summary , if you look at it , in year one the people can sell their land to get income , but they get jobs back in the construction and the reforestation , the working with the orangutans , and they can use the waste wood to make handicraft.
They get all these other benefits : environmentally , money , they get education -- it ' s a great deal.
I hope -- if you want to know more , you can read more.

During many years , I made some speeches starting with this saying :  " City is not a problem , it ' s a solution. " 
There ' s no matter of scale . It ' s not a question of scale , it ' s not a question of financial resources.
And when you realize that the casque of the turtle looks like an urban tessitura , and can we imagine , if we cut the casque of the turtle , how sad she ' s going to be ? 
He is invited for a party -- he never wants to leave.
He ' s a very demanding person.
Curitiba , Rio : it ' s like two birds kissing themselves.
And that ' s the structure of the city of Curitiba.
And it took 25 years until another city ...
That means mostly two main issues -- mobility and sustainability -- are becoming very important for the cities.
And that ' s the evolution of the system.
And for handicapped , they can use this as a normal system.
It ' s not enough , new sources of energy.
We started in  ' 83 , proposing for the city of Rio how to connect the subway with the bus.
And it ' s not Shanghai , it ' s not being colored during the day , only at night it will look this way.
I ' m trying to say we have to combine all the systems , and with one condition : never -- if you have a subway , if you have surface systems , if you have any kind of system -- never compete in the same space.
And the children , we teach during six months how to separate their garbage.
So teach the children.
Try to understand the sectors in the city that could play different roles during the 24 hours.
This is the main pedestrian mall ; we did it in 72 hours . Yes , you have to be fast.
And since we have people from Uzbekistan , Kazakhstan , Tajikistan , [unclear] , we have to stop the program.
Parks -- old quarries that they were transformed into parks.
Planning takes time . And I ' m proposing urban acupuncture.
So , I want just to end saying that you can always propose new materials -- new sustainable materials -- but keep in mind that we have to work fast to the end , because we don ' t have the whole time to plan.
At the end , I would like if you can help me to sing the sustainable song.

And actually , Chris called me a week after I ' d given my talk and he said ,  " We ' re going to start putting them online.
So I suppose you could multiply that by 20 or something to get the number of people who ' ve seen it.
Al Gore spoke at the TED conference I spoke at four years ago and talked about the climate crisis.
You see , he ' s right.
I have one climate crisis ; I don ' t really need the second one. " 
I meet all kinds of people who don ' t think they ' re really good at anything.
Well , I do.
They endure it rather than enjoy it and wait for the weekend.
It would be foolish for me to abandon this , because it speaks to my most authentic self. " 
And high among them is education , because education , in a way , dislocates very many people from their natural talents.
And you might imagine education would be the way that happens , but too often it ' s not.
This has to be transformed into something else.
The great problem for reform or transformation is the tyranny of common sense ; things that people think ,  " Well , it can ' t be done any other way because that ' s the way it ' s done. " 
We don ' t teach American history in Britain.
The occasion is piled high with difficulty , and we must rise with the occasion. " 
We must disenthrall ourselves , and then we shall save our country. " 
And many of our ideas have been formed , not to meet the circumstances of this century , but to cope with the circumstances of previous centuries.
And the reason is that you take it for granted.
Are there any people here under the age of 25 ? 
Teenagers do not wear wristwatches.
Kids now live in a world which is digitized , and the time , for them , is everywhere.
She doesn ' t see the point.
 " It has multiple functions. " 
Everybody who ' s spoken at TED has told us implicitly , or sometimes explicitly , a different story : that life is not linear ; it ' s organic.
I think we are obsessed with getting people to college.
And I was up in San Francisco a while ago doing a book signing.
And I said ,  " How long have you been a fireman ?  " 
He said ,  " But I wanted to be a fireman. " 
And he said ,  " It was humiliating because he said it in front of the whole class and I really felt dreadful.
He said ,  " I think he thinks better of me now. " 
When I arrived in L.A.
If we had time , I could go into this , but we don ' t.
But as we just heard in this last session , there ' s such competition now to get into kindergarten -- to get to the right kindergarten -- that people are being interviewed for it at three.
Spent the first six months breastfeeding , the way I can see it. " 
This is something Jamie Oliver talked about the other day.
And we have sold ourselves into a fast food model of education , and it ' s impoverishing our spirit and our energies as much as fast food is depleting our physical bodies.
I worked out recently that I was given a guitar as a kid at about the same time that Eric Clapton got his first guitar.
It just wouldn ' t work.
It ' s about passion , and what excites our spirit and our energy.
If you ' re doing something that doesn ' t resonate with your spirit , five minutes feels like an hour.
We have to move to a model that is based more on principles of agriculture.
So when we look at reforming education and transforming it , it isn ' t like cloning a system.
And doing that , I think , is the answer to the future because it ' s not about scaling a new solution ; it ' s about creating a movement in education in which people develop their own solutions , but with external support based on a personalized curriculum.
But we have to change from the industrial model to an agricultural model , where each school can be flourishing tomorrow.
And I wanted to just very quickly ...
And he says ,  " I ' ve got something else , but it may not be for you. " 
Thank you very much.

Fight back ?  Give in ? 
I remember I was about 13 , glued to a grainy black and white television in my parents '  living room as Soviet tanks rolled into Budapest , and kids not much older than me were throwing themselves at the tanks and getting mown down.
And she said ,  " What on Earth for ?  " 
And I started to cry.
But just unpack your suitcase. " 
And what I ' ve discovered since is this : Bullies use violence in three ways.
And they did it in a total devotion to non-violence.
And the first is that the change that has to take place has to take place here , inside me.
When do I give in ? 
She was leading a group of students on a protest in the streets of Rangoon.
And she walked forward with such calm and such clarity and such total lack of fear that she could walk right up to the first gun , put her hand on it and lower it.
So what about our fear ? 
So we all know the three o ' clock in the morning syndrome , when something you ' ve been worrying about wakes you up -- I see a lot of people -- and for an hour you toss and turn , it gets worse and worse , and by four o ' clock you ' re pinned to the pillow by a monster this big.
And you talk to the fear and you ask it what it wants , what it needs.
And you say ,  " Okay , now we ' re going back to sleep.
I got up , made the cup of tea , sat down with it , did it all and I ' m here -- still partly paralyzed , but I ' m here.
But anger as an engine -- in an engine -- is powerful.
Totally ineffective.
And they ' re doing what they think is best.
It was still governments telling people what to do.
It ' s people joining up with people , as Bundy just said , miles away to bring about change.
And the kind of thing they ' re doing is demobilizing militias , rebuilding economies , resettling refugees , even liberating child soldiers.
Up to now their counter-terrorism policy has been to kill insurgents at almost any cost , and if civilians get in the way , that ' s written as  " collateral damage. " 
The British military have always been much better at this.
And these huge soldiers with their backpacks and their body armor , wobbled to the ground.
In the moment , that ' s what he did.
Dictatorships in Czechoslovakia , East Germany , Estonia , Latvia , Lithuania , Mali , Madagascar , Poland , the Philippines , Serbia , Slovenia , I could go on , and now Tunisia and Egypt.
And it ' s been translated into 26 languages.
Because finally human beings are getting it.
I don ' t have to believe in it.
And we can organize to overcome oppression by opening our hearts as well as strengthening this incredible resolve.

And the solution I offer is to the biggest culprit in this massive mistreatment of the earth by humankind , and the resulting decline of the biosphere.
In his book , Paul charges business and industry as , one , the major culprit in causing the decline of the biosphere , and , two , the only institution that is large enough , and pervasive enough , and powerful enough , to really lead humankind out of this mess.
I simply said ,  " If Hawken is right and business and industry must lead , who will lead business and industry ? 
I once told a Fortune Magazine writer that someday people like me would go to jail.
Asked later in the Canadian documentary ,  " The Corporation, "  what I meant by the  " go to jail "  remark , I offered that theft is a crime.
That is , impact is generated by people , what they consume in their affluence , and how it is produced.
So we set out at Interface , in 1994 , to create an example : to transform the way we made carpet , a petroleum-intensive product for materials as well as energy , and to transform our technologies so they diminished environmental impact , rather than multiplied it.
So I ask ,  " What would move T , technology , from the numerator -- call it T1 -- where it increases impact , to the denominator -- call it T2 -- where it reduces impact ? 
Powered by fossil fuel-derived energy.
In the new industrial revolution extractive must be replaced by renewable ; linear by cyclical ; fossil fuel energy by renewable energy , sunlight ; wasteful by waste-free ; and abusive by benign ; and labor productivity by resource productivity.
So I can tell you how far we have come in the ensuing 12 years.
This is the magnitude of the reduction the entire global technosphere must realize by 2050 to avoid catastrophic climate disruption -- so the scientists are telling us.
Down 40 percent in our broadloom carpet business , which we acquired in 1993 right here in California , City of Industry , where water is so precious.
Those new cyclical technologies have contributed mightily to the fact that we have produced and sold 85 million square yards of climate-neutral carpet since 2004 , meaning no net contribution to global climate disruption in producing the carpet throughout the supply chain , from mine and well head clear to end-of-life reclamation -- independent third-party certified.
You can point and click today at Flor.com and have Cool Carpet delivered to your front door in five days.
We call this Mission Zero.
From real life experience , costs are down , not up , reflecting some 400 million dollars of avoided costs in pursuit of zero waste -- the first face of Mount Sustainability.
Our people are galvanized around this shared higher purpose.
Costs , products , people , marketplaces -- what else is there ? 
But the marketplace was down 36 percent.
I don ' t think so.
And what if we made A a lowercase  ' a, '  suggesting that it is a means to an end , and that end is happiness -- more happiness with less stuff.
At Interface we really intend to bring this prototypical sustainable , zero-footprint industrial company fully into existence by 2020.
If we can actually do it , it must be possible.
Who is that person ? 
On a Tuesday morning in March of 1996 , I was talking to people , as I did at every opportunity back then , bringing them along and often not knowing whether I was connecting.
Because it told me , by God , one person got it.
A wise friend introduced us two.
Tomorrow ' s child , my daughter , son , I ' m afraid I ' ve just begun to think of you and of your good , though always having known I should.
We are , each and every one , a part of the web of life.

Ben Cameron : The true power of the performing arts
And one who lives for my home theater , a home theater where I devour DVDs , video-on-demand and a lot of television.
While we initially heralded the Internet as the fantastic new marketing device that was going to solve all our problems , we now realize that the Internet is , if anything , too effective in that regard.
Gen-Y ' ers spent even more -- 23.8 hours , the majority online.
We can shop at three in the morning or eight at night , ordering jeans tailor-made for our unique body-types.
But as particular as they feel to us , we know we ' re not alone.
Everyone I talk to in performing arts resonates to the words of Adrienne Rich , who , in  " Dreams of a Common Language, "  wrote ,  " We are out in a country that has no language , no laws.
Now , rather than saying that we ' re on the brink of our own annihilation , I prefer to believe that we are engaged in a fundamental reformation , a reformation like the religious Reformation of the 16th century.
How are they entitled to practice ? 
In the 1930s , if any of you wanted to make a movie , you had to work for Warner Brothers or RKO because who could afford a movie set and lighting equipment and editing equipment and scoring and more ? 
Now , go to YouTube , Facebook ; you have worldwide distribution without leaving the privacy of your own bedroom.
This group , others have called the  " pro ams, "  amateur artists doing work at a professional level.
But I want to be clear , just as the religious Reformation did not spell the end to the formal Church or to the priesthood ; I believe that our artistic institutions will continue to have importance.
And indeed , while we ' ve tended to polarize the amateur from the professional , the single most exciting development in the last five to 10 years has been the rise of the professional hybrid artist , the professional artist who works , not primarily in the concert hall or on the stage ; but most frequently around women ' s rights , or human rights , or on global warming issues or AIDS relief for more -- not out of economic necessity , but out of a deep , organic conviction that the work that she or he , is called to do cannot be accomplished in the traditional hermetic arts environment.
And indeed , I think , rather than being annihilated , the performing arts are posed on the brink of a time when we will be more important than we have ever been.
Business leadership will depend more and more on emotional intelligence , the ability to listen deeply , to have empathy , to articulate change , to motivate others -- the very capacities that the arts cultivate with every encounter.
God knows , if we ever needed that capacity in human history , we need it now.
I promise you the hand of the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation is stretched out in friendship for now and years to come.
The three Ahn sisters breathe new life into the piano trio with their passionate musicmaking . At TEDWomen , they start with the bright and poppy  " Skylife, "  by David Balakrishnan , then play a gorgeous , slinky version of  " Oblivion, "  by Astor Piazzolla.
Angella Ahn : Thank you.
What you just heard is  " Skylife "  by David Balakrishnan.
This was in the middle of the 20th century when music from the heart , beautiful music , wasn ' t the most popular thing in the classical music world.

Bill Strickland makes change with a slide show
I have some pictures that represent my life and what I do for a living.
So , I walked in the art room and I said ,  " What is that ?  " 
And so for the remaining two years of my high school , I cut all my classes.
And he drove me out to the University of Pittsburgh where I filled out a college application and got in on probation.
One is called Bidwell Training Center ; it is a vocational school for ex-steel workers and single parents and welfare mothers.
Manchester Craftsmen ' s Guild is named after my neighborhood.
I went out and hired a student of Frank Lloyd Wright , the architect , and I asked him to build me a world class center in the worst neighborhood in Pittsburgh.
Built in a tough neighborhood where people have been given up for dead.
And now that I ' m giving speeches at conferences like TED , I got put on the board of the Carnegie Museum.
So , from that fountain I built this building.
That ' s intentional.
He ' s making a ton of money doing custom furniture for rich people.
Those are real and they ' re in my building every day.
You don ' t need a task force or a study group to buy flowers for your kids.
That happens to be at Christmas time.
And he called me into his office -- which is the equivalent of going to see the Wizard of Oz -- and John Heinz had 600 million dollars , and at the time I had about 60 cents.
Because back then , we were building a trades program.
I said ,  " Senator , it appears that we ' re going into the food training business. " 
And we ' ve never looked back.
Because the students made puff pastry and that ' s what the school ate every day.
Because I wanted to let them know every day of their life that they have value at this place I call my center.
What we ' ve discovered is the only thing wrong with poor people is they don ' t have any money , which happens to be a curable condition.
They have no calories.
We train pharmaceutical technicians for the pharmacy industry , we train medical technicians for the medical industry , and we train chemical technicians for companies like Bayer and Calgon Carbon and Fisher Scientific and Exxon.
We train corporate travel agents for the travel industry.
And so you must ask yourself the question : how is it possible in the 21st century that we graduate children from schools who can ' t read the diplomas that they have in their hands ? 
That ' s our library with more handcrafted furniture.
I have 400 kids from the Pittsburgh public school system that come to me every day of the week for arts education.
For that I won a big old plaque -- Man of the Year in Education.
We have ceramics and photography and computer imaging.
We teach photography.
We have a world class gallery because we believe that poor kids need a world class gallery , so I designed this thing.
And I said ,  " Bill , I want to hire you , man.
So , he jumped in the van , he went to Miss Jones '  house and said ,  " Miss Jones , I knew you wanted to come to your kid ' s art opening but you probably didn ' t have a ride.
Because now it ' s become socially not acceptable not to show up to support your children at the Manchester Craftsmen ' s Guild because people think you ' re bad parents.
And by the time I cut these kids loose from high school , they ' ve got four shows on their resume before they apply to college because it ' s all up here.
This is brand new.
My only criticism is your computers are getting a little bit old. " 
She said ,  " Yes , sir. " 
We got it just done in time to show you , so it ' s kind of the world debut of our digital imaging center.
And a guy named Dizzy Gillespie showed up to play there because he knew this man over here , Marty Ashby.
I said ,  " You ' re the gift. " 
And he showed up and said ,  " Dizzy talking about you all over the country , man , and I want to help you. " 
And Joe Williams came up to me and he put his hand on my shoulder and he said ,  " God ' s picked you , man , to do this work.
And I recorded it and we won something called a Grammy.
So , we ' ve become one of the hot , young jazz recording studios in the United States of America in the middle of the inner city with a high crime rate.
And there ' s Dizzy , just like I told you . He was there.
We put the mops in the hallway and re-engineered the thing and that ' s where we recorded the first Grammy.
And I can now tell you with absolute certainty that an appearance on Oprah Winfrey will sell 10,000 CDs.
And that ' s the building , and that ' s the model , and on the right ' s a high-tech greenhouse and in the middle ' s the medical technology building.
Every building has a fountain.
And as a result of the association , I ' m now a director of the Mellon Financial Corporation that bought Dreyfus.
And we have a handshake with one of the large retail grocers to sell our orchids in all 240 stores in six states.
And we got the funding and we open in the fall.
I had a chance to buy this whole industrial park -- which is less than 1,000 feet from the riverfront -- for four million dollars and I didn ' t do it.
The moral of the story is you must be prepared to act on your dreams , just in case they do come true.
He said ,  " Man , that ' s a great story.
My name ' s Willie Brown. " 
And I said ,  " Herbie , this is my concept of a training center for poor people. " 
He said ,  " San Francisco. " 
And he got me five acres of land on San Francisco Bay and we got an architect and we got a general contractor and we got Herbie on the board , and our friends from HP , and our friends from Steelcase , and our friends from Cisco , and our friends from Wells Fargo and Genentech.
And I said ,  " Well , thank you very much for that.
Thanks very much , and give me your card and sometime we ' ll talk. " 
I said ,  " Well , I met the guy who built the thing and he left me his card. " 
And all I ' ve got is a box of slides. " 
And in the back of the room , a woman stood up and she said ,  " In 35 years of living in this God forsaken place , you ' re the only person that ' s come down here and treated us with dignity.
And I think we can get in the ground this year as the first replication of the center in Pittsburgh.
And so he ' s assembled a group of people.
Because Mr . Ross used to bring in your albums when I was 16 years old in the pottery class , when the world was all dark , and your music got me to the sunlight. " 
I believe in you.
In Pennsylvania it costs 60,000 dollars to keep people in jail , most of whom look like me.
I am banking on you and I ' m banking on guys like Herbie and Quincy and Hackett and Richard and very decent people who still believe in something.
And I believe we can turn this whole story around to one of celebration and one of hope.
And my hope is that I ' ve made a few here tonight.
medical research,medicine,science,technology
So I ' m really a basic scientist , not a clinician , but in the last year and a half I ' ve started to switch over , to use what we ' ve been learning about these patterns of activity to develop prosthetic devices , and what I wanted to do today is show you an example of this.
There are 10 million people in the U.S.
And so , you know , for example , with these devices , patients can see simple things like bright lights and high contrast edges , not very much more , so nothing close to normal vision has been possible.
So when you look at something , like this image of this baby ' s face , it goes into your eye and it lands on your retina , on the front-end cells here , the photoreceptors.
Anyway , you get the idea.
Until the only things that you have left are these cells here , the output cells , the ones that send the signals to the brain , but because of all that degeneration they aren ' t sending any signals anymore.
So it consists of two parts , what we call an encoder and a transducer.
So no other device has been able to do this.
In other words , we ' re not literally replacing the components of the retina.
Now let me put my money where my mouth is and show you that we can actually produce normal output , and what the implications of this are.
So as you can see , the firing patterns from the blind animal treated with the encoder-transducer really do very closely match the normal firing patterns -- and it ' s not perfect , but it ' s pretty good -- and the blind animal treated with the standard prosthetic , the responses really don ' t.
So I ' m just going to show you one bottom-line experiment that answers this , and of course I ' ve got a lot of other data , so if you ' re interested I ' m happy to show more . So the experiment is called a reconstruction experiment.
So let me show you , and I ' m going to start with the standard method first.
But the key one really is the encoder alone , because we can team up the encoder with the different transducer.
But there was this limiting factor , the issue of the code , and how to make the cells respond better , produce normal responses , and so this was our contribution.
So the same strategy that we used to find the code for the retina we can also use to find the code for other areas , for example , the auditory system and the motor system , so for treating deafness and for motor disorders.
Bonnie Bassler discovered that bacteria  " talk "  to each other , using a chemical language that lets them coordinate defense and mount attacks . The find has stunning implications for medicine , industry -- and our understanding of ourselves.
Bacteria are the oldest living organisms on the earth.
And the way bacteria make a living is that they consume nutrients from the environment , they grow to twice their size , they cut themselves down in the middle , and one cell becomes two , and so on and so on.
There is about a trillion human cells that make each one of us who we are and able to do all the things that we do , but you have 10 trillion bacterial cells in you or on you at any moment in your life.
Well it turns out you have 100 times more bacterial genes playing a role in you or on you all of your life.
They cover us in an invisible body armor that keeps environmental insults out so that we stay healthy.
So , there ' s all kinds of bacteria on the Earth that have no business being in you or on you at any time , and if they are , they make you incredibly sick.
They live this sort of boring life where they grow and divide , and they ' ve always been considered to be these asocial reclusive organisms.
What you ' re looking at on this slide is just a person from my lab holding a flask of a liquid culture of a bacterium , a harmless beautiful bacterium that comes from the ocean , named Vibrio fischeri.
What was actually interesting to us was not that the bacteria made light , but when the bacteria made light.
What we ' ve figured out is that the way that they do that is that they talk to each other , and they talk with a chemical language.
But when the bacteria grow and double and they ' re all participating in making these molecules , the molecule -- the extracellular amount of that molecule increases in proportion to cell number.
Again , another plug for the animals in the ocean , Vibrio fischeri lives in this squid.
The squid is nocturnal , so during the day it buries itself in the sand and sleeps , but then at night it has to come out to hunt.
And it opens and closes the shutter so the amount of light coming out of the bottom -- which is made by the bacterium -- exactly matches how much light hits the squid ' s back , so the squid doesn ' t make a shadow.
And so what happens is every morning when the sun comes up the squid goes back to sleep , it buries itself in the sand , and it ' s got a pump that ' s attached to its circadian rhythm , and when the sun comes up it pumps out like 95 percent of the bacteria.
And what we found -- so this is now supposed to be , again , my bacterial cell -- is that Vibrio fischeri has a protein -- that ' s the red box -- it ' s an enzyme that makes that little hormone molecule , the red triangle.
When the molecule increases to a certain amount -- which says something about the number of cells -- it locks down into that receptor and information comes into the cells that tells the cells to turn on this collective behavior of making light.
We have a fancy name for this : we call it quorum sensing.
It ' s not like a couple bacteria get in you and they start secreting some toxins -- you ' re enormous , that would have no effect on you . You ' re huge.
We also then went to look at what are these molecules -- these were the red triangles on my slides before.
What I hope you can see is that the molecules are related.
Each molecule fits into its partner receptor and no other.
Once we got that far we thought we were starting to understand that bacteria have these social behaviors.
Anywhere on your body , it looks pretty much like this , and what I hope you can see is that there ' s all kinds of bacteria there.
They all have a species-specific system -- they have a molecule that says  " me. " 
What happens is that bacteria are able to count how many of me and how many of you.
What the important thing is that we learned is that every bacterium has exactly the same enzyme and makes exactly the same molecule.
But what we started to think is that maybe there is something practical that we can do here as well.
Couldn ' t these be new kinds of antibiotics ? 
We kill bacteria with traditional antibiotics and that selects for resistant mutants.
The first one is we ' ve targeted the intraspecies communication system.
We ' ve also done the same thing with the pink system.
In this one I ' m just using the interspecies molecule , but the logic is exactly the same.
What we ' ve been able to do is to give these virulent infections , but we give them in conjunction with our anti-quorum sensing molecules -- so these are molecules that look kind of like the real thing , but they ' re a little bit different which I ' ve depicted on this slide.
Of course what that allows bacteria to do is to be multicellular.
Bacteria have been on the Earth for billions of years ; humans , couple hundred thousand.
I hope that what you ' ve learned is that bacteria can distinguish self from other.
It ' s not like your heart cells and your kidney cells get all mixed up every day , and that ' s because there ' s all of this chemistry going on , these molecules that say who each of these groups of cells is , and what their tasks should be.
So , we ' ve targeted those systems to make the molecules work better.
Everything I told you about was discovered by someone in that picture.
It ' s a really lucky demographic to work with.
Thanks.

If you think about the arguments we have , most of the time it ' s shouting matches on cable television , ideological food fights on the floor of Congress.
But we too rarely articulate and defend and argue about those big moral questions in our politics.
According to Aristotle , justice means giving people what they deserve.
Take the example of flutes.
Who should get the best flute ? 
Who else ? 
Why ? 
Peter : The greatest benefit to all.
MS : All right.
That ' s all right.
And the point , the essential nature , of musical performance is to produce excellent music.
Now , flutes may seem .. . the distribution of flutes may seem a trivial case.
He was a very good golfer , but he had a disability.
They said ,  " No.
I want to compete.
How many here would say that Casey Martin does have a right to use a golf cart ? 
And how many would not ?  How many would say he doesn ' t ? 
What would be your reason ? 
How would you answer the objection ? 
MS : Charlie says -- We ' ll get Charlie a microphone in case someone wants to reply.
Charlie : It doesn ' t matter ; it ' s not part of the game.
Who has an answer for Charlie ? 
MS : Walking all those holes ? 
Charlie , what do you say to Warren ? 
Charley : And I am.
And they brought in Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer.
The fatigue factor is an important part of golf.
What do you suppose they said ? 
And the Supreme Court justices wrestled with that question.
It ' s interesting because he rejected the Aristotelian premise underlying the majority ' s opinion.
But since it is the very nature of a game to have no object except amusement , that is , what distinguishes games from productive activity , it is quite impossible to say that any of a game ' s arbitrary rules is essential. " 
If we had thought that the rules of the sports we care about are merely arbitrary , rather than designed to call forth the virtues and the excellences that we think are worthy of admiring , we wouldn ' t care about the outcome of the game.
What would it be ? 
Why ? 
So if golfing is the kind of game that can be played while riding around in a golf cart , it would be hard to confer on the golfing greats the status that we confer , the honor and recognition that goes to truly great athletes.
How many here favor the first policy : the state should recognize traditional marriage only ? 
And the defenders of same-sex marriage say no , procreation is not the only purpose of marriage ; what about a lifelong , mutual , loving commitment ? 
So let ' s step back from these cases and see how they shed light on the way we might improve , elevate , the terms of political discourse in the United States , and for that matter , around the world.
That , it seems to me , is a way to begin to restore the art of democratic argument.
Thanks . Thank you.
Now look , you ' re a pioneer of open education.
In the classroom , we have arguments on some of the most fiercely held moral convictions that students have about big public questions.
MS : Right . We did a little bit of it here with 1,500 people in Long Beach , and we do it in a classroom at Harvard with about 1,000 students.
Michael Sandel . Thank you so much.

I ' m going to talk about why defeating aging is desirable.
And then I ' m going spend perhaps the second half of the talk talking about , you know , how we might actually be able to prove that fatalism is wrong , namely , by actually doing something about it.
And of course , the last thing I ' m going to talk about is how to reach that intermediate step , that point of maybe 30 years life extension.
That was easy . OK.
Now the thing is , I would like to put it to you that the main reason why we think that malaria is a bad thing is because of a characteristic of malaria that it shares with aging.
I mean , I know I ' m with a sympathetic audience here , but , as we know , a lot of people are not entirely persuaded by this logic.
It ' s ecologically sound ; it stops the population explosion of foxes. " 
It ' s not just about life , of course -- -- it ' s about healthy life , you know -- getting frail and miserable and dependent is no fun , whether or not dying may be fun.
And , I mean , OK , I ' m not actually saying that these excuses are completely valueless.
But the question is , are they so dangerous -- these risks of doing something about aging -- that they outweigh the downside of doing the opposite , namely , leaving aging as it is ? 
People worry about overpopulation ; they say ,  " Well , if we fix aging , no one ' s going to die to speak of , or at least the death toll is going to be much lower , only from crossing St . Giles carelessly.
I don ' t agree with those answers . I think they basically don ' t work.
And , I say that that ' s fine -- the future of humanity is entitled to make that choice.
Right . So the next thing is , now why should we get a little bit more active on this ? 
Like , for example , making up these ridiculous reasons why aging is actually a good thing after all.
And that ' s why we have to really talk about this a lot -- evangelize , I will go so far as to say , quite a lot -- in order to get people ' s attention , and make people realize that they are in a trance in this regard.
A very simple definition.
So basically , metabolism , which is defined as basically everything that keeps us alive from one day to the next , has side effects.
They ' re what I ' m calling here the  " gerontology approach "  and the  " geriatrics approach. " 
But unfortunately the thing is that we don ' t understand metabolism very well.
So then , what do we do about that ? 
Just suppose , as I said , that we do acquire -- let ' s say we do it today for the sake of argument -- the ability to confer 30 extra years of healthy life on people who are already in middle age , let ' s say 55.
We can ' t just say ,  " Well , if they ' re young enough to benefit from these therapies , then they ' ll live 30 years longer. " 
There are fundamental , major breakthroughs , and there are incremental refinements of those breakthroughs.
But after that , things were pretty steady and pretty uniform.
This is the sort of thing you see after a fundamental breakthrough.
So I think that actually step two , that I called a step a moment ago , isn ' t a step at all.
The therapies will be improving faster than the remaining imperfections in the therapies are catching up with us.
I ' m saying that the rate of improvement of those therapies will be enough.
Well , it seems to get the point across.
But if you ' re only 50 , then there ' s a chance that you might be able to pull out of the dive and , you know -- -- eventually get through this and start becoming biologically younger in a meaningful sense , in terms of your youthfulness , both physical and mental , and in terms of your risk of death from age-related causes.
And that ' s quite a thought.
I ' m calling it  " robust mouse rejuvenation, "  not very imaginatively.
And then we do a whole bunch of stuff to them , and with those therapies , we get them to live , on average , to their fifth birthday.
Secondly , what does it mean for the public ' s perception of how long it ' s going to take for us to get to those things , starting from the time we get the mice ? 
I say that ' s nonsense.
15 years from the robust mouse.
They ' ll be wrong , but that actually won ' t matter too much.
So in order to tell you now how we ' re going to get these mice , I ' m going to add a little bit to my description of aging.
And this turns out to be useful.
And geriatricians try to hold back the sands of time by stopping the damage converting into pathology.
The engineering approach does not intervene in any processes.
We know that this threshold exists , because we don ' t get age-related diseases until we ' re in middle age , even though the damage has been accumulating since before we were born.
This list is just for illustration ; it is incomplete.
And there are only seven of them.
Of course one can make a biological argument.
The answer is : long-lived molecules , because if a short-lived molecule undergoes damage , but then the molecule is destroyed -- like by a protein being destroyed by proteolysis -- then the damage is gone , too.
Some of them are partially implemented already , the ones at the top.
You may have been dissatisfied with this talk , but fundamentally you have to go and read this stuff.
And of course the main thing is that you shouldn ' t trust people who call themselves gerontologists because , as with any radical departure from previous thinking within a particular field , you know , you expect people in the mainstream to be a bit resistant and not really to take it seriously.
And you know what happened.
This is what ' s going to take a bit of money.
And I think we know how to do it . And I ' ll stop there.
AG : Because I am an old man . I am actually 158.
AG : Brilliant . Thank you for asking a question that I can answer with an uncontroversial answer.
CA : The genes don ' t care but we do ? 
That means that I ' m one of your subjects to become a 1,000-year-old ? 
So , it ' s not quite as good as you might think , you might hope.
If there are cells in my body that live all 80 years , as opposed to a typical , you know , couple of months ? 
There are species that have no aging -- Hydra for example -- but they do it by not having a nervous system -- and not having any tissues in fact that rely for their function on very long-lived cells.

First , of course , the economic meltdown.
By the way , the pronunciation is  " Eyjafjallajokull. " 
Why would two women who were enjoying successful careers in investment banking in the corporate sector leave to found a financial services firm ? 
So we decided , a bit fed-up with this world and also with the strong feeling in our stomach that this wasn ' t sustainable , to found a financial services firm based on our values , and we decided to incorporate feminine values into the world of finance.
And we got a great group of people to join us -- principled people with great skills , and investors with a vision and values to match ours.
We believe in risk awareness.
But in 2007 , at the height of the sub-prime and all the complicated financial structures , it was quite opposite to the reckless risk-taking behaviors that we saw on the market.
It is actually people that make money and lose money , not Excel spreadsheets.
So we like to see profits , plus positive social and environmental benefits , when we invest.
The whole thing about the female trend is not about women being better than men ; it is actually about women being different from men , bringing different values and different ways to the table.
Will government change ? 
Einstein said that this was the definition of insanity -- to do the same things over and over again , hoping for a different outcome.
And I know that consumers are becoming more conscious , and they are going to start voting with their wallets , and they are going to change the face of business and finance from the outside , if they don ' t do it from the inside.
Women in Iceland took the day off.
For me it was the start of a long journey , but I decided that day to matter.
So I ' ve had incredibly many women role models that have influenced who I am and where I am today.
We are not the same , and it ' s great . Because of our differences , we create and sustain life.
So let ' s move away from thinking about business here and philanthropy there , and let ' s start thinking about doing good business.
Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala , the former finance minister of Nigeria , sums up four days of intense discussion on aid versus trade on the closing day of TEDGlobal 2007 , and shares a personal story explaining her own commitment to this cause.
It ' s very , very difficult to speak at the end of a conference like this , because everyone has spoken . Everything has been said.
But we are talking about  " Africa : the Next Chapter "  because we are looking at the old and the present chapter -- that we ' re looking at , and saying it ' s not such a good thing.
And the importance of that is that we have a platform to build on.
And inflation has come down.
You know , we ' ve built up reserves . Why is that important ? 
In 2005 , remittances -- I just took one country , Nigeria skyrocketing -- skyrocketing is too dramatic , but increasing dramatically.
And instead of an outflow , you are now getting a net inflow.
62 percent of our population is below the age of 24.
But most of all that they are productively engaged in life , and that they are creating the kind of productive environment in our countries that will make things happen.
There is no way you can know what people want.
But before I get to this slide , I just wanted to run you through this.
The economies were not growing.
Creating our own program to solve problems , like fighting corruption , building institutions , stabilizing the micro economy.
And that ' s not what the debate should be about.
To move our continent forward , to do the things that need doing that I talked about -- getting young people employed.
And I want to tell you something.
And I said ,  " Mo , you ' re right . We have -- no , but we ' ve already been doing it!
The issue is not that.
I want to tell you a little story.
We spent much of our time with my mother cooking.
At a certain point in time , in 1969 , things were really bad.
Well , I was in the middle of it.
He was in the army.
And she had such a high fever . We tried everything.
It was really hot . I was very hungry.
I got there and I saw huge crowds.
And while they were trying to break down the door , I climbed in through the window , and jumped in.
In about two to three hours , she started to move.
I strapped her on my back.
Why am I telling that ?  I ' m telling you that because -- when it is you or your person involved -- you don ' t care where -- whether it ' s aid.
And as an economist , we can also look at that side of the story.
So even from an economic standpoint , if we leave the social and the humanitarian , we need to save lives now.
You know , we have to use it well.
The EU transferred 10 billion . Where did they use it ? 
Did you know that Ireland got 3 billion dollars in aid ? 
They used it to build an information superhighway , gain infrastructure that enables them to participate in the information technology revolution , and to create jobs in their economy.
When we ask them and tell them what we need , one of my worries today is that we have many foundations now.
But I fear -- and I ' m very grateful to all of them for what they are trying to do on the continent -- but I ' m also worried . I wake up with a gnawing in my belly because I see a new set of aid entrepreneurs on the continent.
They are just discovering.
They want to visit us , see what ' s happening on the ground and make a decision.
Are we on their boards when they make decisions about where to channel money ?  Are we there ? 
Have we done that ?  The answer is no.
Our inability to take charge and say to all these people bringing their money ,  " Sit down. " 
Here is where we want you to channel this money. " 
Ten years from now we will have the same story , and we will be repeating the same things.
But it cannot do it alone.
Well , why don ' t we first say to those helping us out ,  " Don ' t be shy about infrastructure.
Don ' t be shy of it.
Aid cannot solve our problems , I ' m firmly convinced about that.
If you tell them ,  " We need a road here, "  they will help you build it.
Infrastructure , infrastructure , infrastructure and discipline.
So we can make a catalytic to help us provide some of that.
One idea.
Am I out of time ? 
But there are people -- women -- creating jobs.
We don ' t want men beating their wives because they don ' t have a job , and so on.
Beatrice Gakuba has created 200 jobs from her flower business in Rwanda.
She will create another 100 , 200 more jobs.
http://www.ted.com/talks/charles_limb_your_brain_on_improv.html
Charles Limb : Your brain on improv
And so I ' m going to try to talk to you over the next few minutes about my career in terms of how I ' m able to actually try to study music and really try to grapple with all these questions of how the brain is able to be creative.
And this video is a video of Keith Jarrett , who ' s a well-known jazz improviser and probably the most well-known , iconic example of someone who takes improvisation to a really higher level.
I ' ve always -- just as a listener , as just a fan -- I listen to that , and I ' m just astounded.
There ' s not too many brain-dead people creating art.
And I think that ' s a good question.
Maybe we ' re not the right people to do it.
And so it gets down to the brain.
I ask questions about what is this brain doing to enable us to do this.
There ' s something called BOLD imaging , which is Blood Oxygen Level Dependent imaging.
Deoxyhemoglobin can be detected by MRI , whereas oxyhemoglobin can ' t.
And this was done with a colleague of mine , Alan Braun , at the NIH.
And it works like this -- this doesn ' t actually produce any sound.
So what do you do now that you have this cool piano keyboard ? 
And so , I have here what we call the  " paradigms. " 
And so what we did was we brought professional jazz players to the NIH , and we had them memorize this piece of music on the left , the lower-left -- which is what you heard me playing -- and then we had them improvise to the same exact chord changes.
And the musicians , they were comfortable in the end.
And then we looked at the brain activity.
And so we had this focal area called the medial prefrontal cortex that went way up in activity.
They do a whole host of things that have to do with self-reflection , introspection , working memory and so forth.
One area turns on , and a big area shuts off , so that you ' re not inhibited , so that you ' re willing to make mistakes , so that you ' re not constantly shutting down all of these new generative impulses.
And I ' ve broken it down into four-bar groups here , so you would know how you would trade.
CL : Mike , come on in . Mike Pope : May the force be with you.
It ' s kind of fun actually.
Mike Pope : This is a pretty good representation of what it ' s like.
That was challenging.
This is one subject ' s data.
He actually had it also homologous on the right.
Now when I think about improvisation and the language , well what ' s next ? 
Mos Def : ♫ .. . brown skin I be , standing five-ten I be ♫ ♫ Rockin '  it when I be , in your vicinity ♫ ♫ Whole-style synergy , recognize symmetry ♫ ♫ Go and try to injure me , broke  ' em down chemically ♫ ♫ Styled it like Kennedy , late like a 10 to three ♫ ♫ When I say when I be , girls say bend that key cut ♫ CL : And so there ' s a lot of analogy between what takes place in free-style rap and jazz.
And my colleagues kind of think I ' m crazy , but I think it ' s very viable.
With this big screen , you can all rap with me . Okay ? 
So now , what ' s great about these free-stylers , they will get cued different words.
He doesn ' t know what ' s coming.
Creatively speaking , it ' s just a phenomenal thing.
CL : That ' s Emmanuel in the scanner.
And what we see , we do see language areas lighting up , but then -- eyes closed -- when you are free-styling versus memorizing , you ' ve got major visual areas lighting up.
So just to conclude , we ' ve got a lot of questions to ask , and like I said , we ' ll ask questions here , not answer them.

Arthur Benjamin ' s formula for changing math education
And everything we learn after that is building up towards one subject.
I mean , don ' t get me wrong . Calculus is an important subject.
But I ' m here to say , as a professor of mathematics , that very few people actually use calculus in a conscious , meaningful way , in their day-to-day lives.
I think if our students , if our high school students -- if all of the American citizens -- knew about probability and statistics , we wouldn ' t be in the economic mess that we ' re in today.
It ' s analyzing trends . It ' s predicting the future.
http://www.ted.com/talks/tan_le_a_headset_that_reads_your_brainwaves.html
Tan Le : A headset that reads your brainwaves
We observe facial expressions , body language , and we can intuit feelings and emotions from our dialogue with one another.
Well , it sounds like a pretty good idea , but this task , as Bruno mentioned , isn ' t an easy one for two main reasons : First , the detection algorithms.
Now this cortical folding presents a significant challenge for interpreting surface electrical impulses.
Our breakthrough was to create an algorithm that unfolds the cortex , so that we can map the signals closer to its source , and therefore making it capable of working across a mass population.
Now this is quite time consuming and isn ' t the most comfortable process.
It doesn ' t require any scalp preparation , no conductive gel or paste.
Now on to the detection algorithms.
He ' s obviously not Joanne -- so we ' ll  " add user. " 
He just hangs out . He ' s relaxed.
Evan Grant : Let ' s do  " pull. " 
But maintain that thought for the entire duration of the eight seconds.
So let ' s see if Evan can actually try and imagine pulling.
And this one is difficult because it ' s all about being able to visualize something that doesn ' t exist in our physical world.
Same sort of drill . So : one , two , three , go.
EG : Losing concentration.
As there is a machine learning algorithm in this -- Thank you.
And once you ' ve trained up the detections , these thoughts can be assigned or mapped to any computing platform , application or device.
And also , colors , lighting , sound and effects can dynamically respond to your emotional state to heighten the experience that you ' re having , in real time.
And of course , also to the lighting -- turning them on or off.
Now blink left to turn back left.
http://www.ted.com/talks/nathan_myhrvold_could_this_laser_zap_malaria.html
Nathan Myhrvold : Could this laser zap malaria ? 
We invent for fun -- invention is a lot of fun to do -- and we also invent for profit.
So I ' m going to briefly discuss a couple of problems that we have and a couple of problems where we ' ve got some solutions underway.
They go bad very quickly if you don ' t , and if you don ' t have stable power grid , this doesn ' t happen , so kids die.
Now , one of these Styrofoam chests will last for about four hours with ice in it.
Now , this is our second generations prototype.
The other idea is kind of interesting , which is , you can ' t reach inside anymore.
So a simple idea , which we hope is going to change the way vaccines are distributed in Africa and around the world.
Two hundred million people a year.
So what can we do about it ? 
That ' s great , except the places that have malaria really bad , they don ' t have health care systems.
You can distribute bed nets , and bed nets are very effective if you use them.
Now , malaria is an incredibly complicated disease.
One of those ways might be better diagnosis.
The other thing is , you know , it would be even better if you didn ' t have to draw the blood.
It ' s produced by the malaria parasite and it ' s a very interesting crystalline substance.
So this creates pulses of light that last a femtosecond.
So here ' s an image of red blood cells , and now we can actually map where the hemozoin and where the malaria parasites are inside those red blood cells.
This is our thousand-core supercomputer.
You spend a certain amount per bed net.
How can you tell ? 
We have all of the precipitation data and the temperature data.
Ultimately , it gives you this.
It nearly goes away in the dry season , because there ' s no place for the mosquitoes to breed.
This is a high-speed camera view of a mosquito.
Now , one of the ways you can make them not fly is with DDT.
The United States did.
Well , let ' s try to kill it with consumer electronics. " 
And , of course , there ' s signal processing and digital cameras.
Now , just suspend disbelief for a moment , and let ' s think of what could happen if we could do that.
You really want to protect them.
Now , it actually gets better than this.
Now , it turns out we only kill the female mosquitoes.
So , this sounds really crazy , right ? 
Now , after thinking about this a little bit we thought , you know , it probably would be simpler to do this with a nonlethal laser.
Take it away Eric.
Now , that ' s a fairly straightforward image processing routine , and let me show you how it works.
So you may be able to hear some mosquitoes flying around.
This is slowed way down so that you have an opportunity to see what ' s happening.
This is very satisfying.
Here ' s another one . Bang.
So , that ' s what I have . Thanks very much.
1020
That ' s a lot.
And it pretty much goes through eight different forms in its lifetime.
It ' s then distributed , and distribution is a massive issue.
There are different types of waste.
Basically a restaurant just like any other.
Floor : sustainable , recyclable.
This bench , although it was uncomfortable for my mom -- she didn ' t like sitting on it , so she went and bought these cushions for me from a local jumble sale -- reusing , a job that was pretty good.
This is powered by wind . All of the lights are daylight bulbs.
And I was thinking , well I ' m trying to think nature , nature , nature.
It actually looks better than a brand new one -- so looking good there.
Here ' s a great little example.
I basically created a menu that allowed people to choose the amount and volume of food that they wanted to consume.
We generate quite a lot of waste.
In here , I have produce and boxes that are unavoidable.
Three compost bins -- go through about 70 kilos of raw vegetable waste a week -- really good , makes fantastic compost.
It was like vegetable jerky , and killed all of them.
And I ultimately want to recycle that , put it back into the loos , maybe wash hands with it , I don ' t know.
I managed to do it.
The whole thing is electric , the restaurant and the kitchen.
The air handling system inside it -- I got rid of air-conditioning because I thought there was too much consumption going on there.
Very advanced , no air-conditioning -- I love it.
And what ' s great is one of the chefs who works in that restaurant lives on this boat -- it ' s off-grid ; it generates all its own power.
I ' ve got water and wood . I ' m just about to do fire.
Five weeks old , it ' s my baby , and it ' s hurting real bad.
So people -- i.e. , perhaps , more working-class -- or perhaps people who actually believe in a cooperative.
So I ' m committing to potatoes ; I ' m committing to milk ; I ' m committing to leeks and broccoli -- all very important stuff.
That ' s zero food waste.
So nature doesn ' t create waste doesn ' t create waste as such.
Environmentally conscious businesses are doable.
I think that if we reduce , reuse , refuse and recycle -- right at the end there -- recycling is the last point I want to make ; but it ' s the four R ' s , rather than the three R ' s -- then I think we ' re going to be on our way.
http://www.ted.com/talks/cesar_kuriyama_one_second_every_day.html
Cesar Kuriyama : One second every day
And one day I was at work and I saw a talk by Stefan Sagmeister on TED , and it was called  " The power of time off, "  and he spoke about how every seven years , he takes a year off from work so he could do his own creative projects , and I was instantly inspired , and I just said ,  " I have to do that . I have to take a year off.
The purpose of this project is , one : I hate not remembering things that I ' ve done in the past.
So if I live to see 80 years of age , I ' m going to have a five-hour video that encapsulates 50 years of my life.
You know , this project for me is a way for me to bridge that gap and remember everything that I ' ve done.
It ' s also kind of a protest , a personal protest , against the culture we have now where people just are at concerts with their cell phones out recording the whole concert , and they ' re disturbing you.
And it just takes a quick , quick second.
One of the reasons that I took my year off was to spend more time with my family , and this really tragic thing happened where my sister-in-law , her intestine suddenly strangled one day , and we took her to the emergency room , and she was , she was in really bad shape.
Or we ' re ,  " Oh , yeah , this party , let me take a picture. " 
It ' s not always a good day , so when you have a bad one , I think it ' s important to remember it , just as much as it is important to remember the [good] days.
The way to really remember what I saw was to record it as I actually saw it.
I think everyone would have a different interpretation of it.
And I don ' t know , I think this project has a lot of possibilities , and I encourage you all to record just a small snippet of your life every day , so you can never forget that that day , you lived.

And we can start a film about that , and we can see a little bit backwards in time.
And they should survive over there , on their own , in the future.
The beast walks sideways on the wet sand of the beach , with its nose pointed into the wind.
TJ : This is a herd , and it is built according to genetical codes.
This is a new generation , a new family , which is able to store the winds.
So , the proportion of the tubes in this animal is very important for the walking.
It works the same as a wheel.
So , 5,000 years after the invention of the wheel , we have a new wheel . And I will show you , in the next video -- can you start it , please ?  -- that very heavy loads can be moved.
It has a feeler , where it can feel obstacles and turn around.
So , they have to survive all the dangers of the beach , and one of the big dangers is the sea . This is the sea.
So imagine that the animal is walking towards the sea.
In fact , it is a step counter , and it counts the steps.
So it ' s a sort of imagination of the simple world of the beach animal.
And the nose is fixed , the whole animal is fixed.
Thank you very much , ladies and gentlemen.

It also is the first species to have its own website encoded in its genetic code.
And as soon as we had these two sequences we thought , if this is supposed to be the smallest genome of a self-replicating species , could there be even a smaller genome ? 
We decided early on that we had to take a synthetic route , even though nobody had been there before , to see if we could synthesize a bacterial chromosome so we could actually vary the gene content to understand the essential genes for life.
Ham and I took two years off as a side project to sequence the human genome , but as soon as that was done we got back to the task at hand.
Our first task was a 5,000-letter code bacteriophage , a virus that attacks only E . coli.
So , substantially larger than we even thought we would go initially.
And some of you have noticed that we switched from the smallest genome to a much larger one.
So this was a debugging , problem-solving scenario from the beginning because there was no recipe of how to get there.
And we knew , once that worked , that we actually had a chance if we could make the synthetic chromosomes to do the same with those.
It turned out the cell that we were trying to transplant into had a nuclease , an enzyme that chews up DNA on its surface , and was happy to eat the synthetic DNA that we gave it and never got transplantations.
So in addition to doing the transplant , we had to find out how to get a bacterial chromosome out of the eukaryotic yeast into a form where we could transplant it into a recipient cell.
When we did these experiments , though , we could get the chromosome out of yeast but it wouldn ' t transplant and boot up a cell.
Further advances came when the team removed the restriction enzyme genes from the recipient capricolum cell.
And Dan led the team for the synthesis of this over one-million-base pair chromosome.
We narrowed it down to one fragment ; we sequenced it and found just one base pair had been deleted in an essential gene.
And then early one morning , at 6 a.m.
Early on , when you ' re working in a new area of science , you have to think about all the pitfalls and things that could lead you to believe that you had done something when you hadn ' t , and , even worse , leading others to believe it.
So the team actually developed a new code within the code within the code.
So , there are four major watermarks all over 1,000 base pairs of genetic code.
So it ' s clearly distinguishable from any other species , having 46 names in it , its own web address.
It ' s a James Joyce quote.
So , because this is as much a philosophical advance as a technical advance in science , we tried to deal with both the philosophical and the technical side.
So with that , I would like to open it first to the floor for questions.
I ' m not sure we ' re the ones that should be explaining how significant it is.
But we actually believe this is going to be a very powerful set of tools and we ' re already starting in numerous avenues to use this tool.
In the vaccine area , Synthetic Genomics and the Institute are forming a new vaccine company because we think these tools can affect vaccines to diseases that haven ' t been possible to date , things where the viruses rapidly evolve , such with rhinovirus.
I think this latest oil spill in the Gulf is a reminder.
Those are just a couple of the approaches and directions that we ' re taking.

Since I live on a houseboat on the running stream of Lake Union , this makes perfect sense to me.
Part of the problem , I think , is that we imagine that the Koran can be read as we usually read a book -- as though we can curl up with it on a rainy afternoon with a bowl of popcorn within reach , as though God -- and the Koran is entirely in the voice of God speaking to Muhammad -- were just another author on the bestseller list.
My Arabic ' s reduced by now to wielding a dictionary , so I took four well-known translations and decided to read them side-by-side , verse-by-verse along with a transliteration and the original seventh-century Arabic.
So I read slowly.
The Koran declares that it comes to renew the message of the Torah and the Gospels.
And then there was the language , the rhythmic cadence of it , reminding me of evenings spent listening to Bedouin elders recite hours-long narrative poems entirely from memory.
And yet the more you add , the more seems to go missing.
But all is not lost in translation.
Yes , it does say that , but in a very specific context : the anticipated conquest of the sanctuary city of Mecca where fighting was usually forbidden , and the permission comes hedged about with qualifiers.
 " Some of these verses are definite in meaning, "  it says ,  " and others are ambiguous. " 
As in , for instance , that little matter of virgins and paradise.
Not a swelling breast nor a high bosom in sight.
And that number 72 never appears.
It ' s not virginity ; it ' s fecundity.
With a dusty backhoe , a handful of Japanese paint markers and a few students in tow , Deborah Gordon digs up ant colonies in the Arizona desert in search of keys to understanding complex systems.
I study ants , and that ' s because I like to think about how organizations work.
There are about 10,000 species of ants.
The queen just lays the eggs . There ' s no management.
Here ' s my study site . This is really a picture of ants , and the rabbit just happens to be there.
And every year I go there and make a map of my study site.
And because of that , I ' ve been able to study how their behavior changes as the colony gets older and larger.
So every year , on the same day -- and it ' s a mystery exactly how that happens -- each colony sends out its virgin , unmated queens with wings , and the males , and they all fly to a common place . And they mate.
And after that , the males all die . That ' s it for them.
She lays eggs , she feeds the larvae -- so an ant starts as an egg , then it ' s a larva.
So this is a one-year-old colony -- this happens to be 536.
They make a midden , a pile of refuse -- mostly the husks of the seeds that they eat.
So it starts out with zero ants , just the founding queen , and it grows to a size of about 10 or 12 thousand ants when the colony is five.
And I know how colony size changes as a function of colony age because I ' ve dug up colonies of known age and counted all the ants.
How is it that the colony manages to adjust the numbers of workers performing each task as conditions change ? 
When extra food becomes available -- and this is what everybody knows about picnics -- then extra ants are allocated to collect the food.
The patrollers -- that ' s supposed to be a magnifying glass -- are an interesting group that go out early in the morning before the foragers are active.
It also looks very similar to some of the cave dwellings of the Hopi people that are in that area.
So what you see the midden workers doing is making a pile of refuse.
So that ' s only about 25 percent of the colony , and they ' re the oldest ants.
I don ' t think that chamber has evolved because of me and my backhoe and my crew of students with pickaxes , but instead because when there ' s flooding , occasionally the colony has to go down deep.
And this is true of most ants -- that the ants you see walking around don ' t do much eating.
And curiously , and interestingly , it looks as though at any time about half the ants in the colony are just doing nothing.
And I think it ' s a very interesting question -- what is there about the way the colony is organized that might give some function to a reserve of ants who are doing nothing ? 
They somehow get into this reserve.
They have eyes , they can distinguish between light and dark , but they mostly work by smell.
Does it matter to the foragers what the nest maintenance workers are doing ? 
So I did experiments where I changed one thing.
And the nest maintenance workers just take all the toothpicks to the outer edge of the nest mound and leave them there.
And lately we ' ve gotten more sophisticated and we have this three-color system.
So , if I change the numbers performing one task , it changes the numbers performing another.
The same ant doesn ' t do the same task over and over its whole life.
But not every transition is possible . And this shows how it works.
So foraging acts as a sink , and the ants inside the nest act as a source.
And here was the most intriguing result : the task allocation.
And the amazing thing about this is that an ant lives only a year.
Instead , something about the organization must be changing as the colony gets older.
And what I ' ve found out is that ants are using a network of antennal contact.
And what we ' re learning is that an ant uses the pattern of its antennal contacts , the rate at which it meets ants of other tasks , in deciding what to do.
But first you might be wondering : how is it that an ant can tell , for example , I ' m a forager.
And we ' ve learned that , in this species -- and I suspect in others as well -- these hydrocarbons , this layer of grease on the outside of ants , is different as ants perform different tasks.
And it turns out that ants will respond to the right rate of contact with a glass bead with hydrocarbon extract on it , as they would to contact with real ants.
This is taken through a fiber optics microscope . It ' s down inside the nest.
You can also see this in the ants just outside the nest entrance like these.
It ' s variable . It ' s noisy . And , in particular , in two ways.
So , we do a lot of simulation and modeling , and also experimental work , to try to figure out how those two kinds of noise combine to , in the aggregate , produce the predictable behavior of ant colonies.
But it works pretty well.
And one of the things that we ' re studying is how natural selection might be acting now to shape this use of interaction patterns -- this network of interaction patterns -- to perhaps increase the foraging efficiency of ant colonies.
So this is the kind of rule that , as the colony develops and gets older and larger , will produce different behavior in an old colony and a small young one.

We ' ve had a digital revolution but we don ' t need to keep having it.
This first one , Internet Zero , up here -- this is a web server that has the cost and complexity of an RFID tag -- about a dollar -- that can go in every light bulb and doorknob , and this is getting commercialized very quickly.
That we can take the whole idea that gave birth to the Internet and bring it down to the physical world in this Internet Zero , this internet of devices.
So , half as much grain is half as much useful , but half a baby or half a computer is less useful than a whole baby or a whole computer , and we ' ve been trying to make computers that work that way.
On the left was postscript being rendered by a conventional computer ; on the right is postscript being rendered from the first prototype we made , but there ' s no frame buffer , IO processor , any of that stuff -- it ' s just this material.
If you need more resource , you just apply more computer.
This is showing making bits , this is showing -- once again , slowed down so you can see it , bits interacting to do logic and multiplexing and de-multiplexing.
Well , Shannon took us , in the  ' 40s , from here to here : from a telephone being a speaker wire that degraded with distance to the Internet . And he proved the first threshold theorem , that shows if you add information and remove it to a signal , you can compute perfectly with an imperfect device.
But all our fabrication is down in this lower left corner.
It ' s an information processing system.
This was just a proof of principle he did of tiles that interact magnetically , where you write a code , much like protein folding , that specifies their structure.
Laser micro-machining : essentially 3D printers that digitally fabricate functional systems , all the way up to building buildings , not by having blueprints , but having the parts code for the structure of the building.
But I had a problem . Once I had all these machines , I was spending too much time teaching students to use them.
Then they ' d ask , can you teach it at MIT ?  It seems too useful ? 
At the end of a semester they integrated their skills.
Well , scream buddy is a portable space for screaming.
This student made a web browser for parrots -- lets parrots surf the Net and talk to other parrots.
This is a student who made a machine that makes machines , and he made it by making Lego bricks that do the computing.
But you don ' t use it for inventory and payroll ; DEC is now twice bankrupt . You don ' t need personal fabrication in the home to buy what you can buy because you can buy it.
Today , when you spend that much of your money , there ' s a government requirement to do outreach , which often means classes at a local school , a website -- stuff that ' s just not that exciting.
This wasn ' t scheduled , but they went from inner-city Boston to Pobal in India , to Secondi-Takoradi on Ghana ' s coast to Soshanguve in a township in South Africa , to the far north of Norway , uncovering , or helping uncover , for all the attention to the digital divide , we would find unused computers in all these places.
So , in place after place we saw this same progression : that we ' d open one of these Fab Labs , where we didn ' t -- this is too crazy to think of.
It goes on from there to serious hands-on technical education informally , out of schools . In Ghana we had set up one of these labs.
So she insisted on fabbing the board , learning how to stuff it , learning how to program it . She didn ' t really know what she was doing or why she was doing it , but she knew she just had to do it . There was something electric about it.
I made a stacking board.
And finally , the lab started doing invention.
Real invention is happening in these labs.
PDPs came between mainframes and minicomputers.
We talked in hushed tones about the great discoveries then.
In DC , I go to every agency that wants to talk , you know ; in the Bay Area , I go to every organization you can think of -- they all want to talk about it , but it breaks their organizational boundaries . In fact , it ' s illegal for them , in many cases , to equip ordinary people to create rather than consume technology.
So this program has split into an NGO foundation , a Fab Foundation to support the scaling , a micro VC fund.
But we still look at technology as top-down mega-projects.
The real opportunity is to harness the inventive power of the world to locally design and produce solutions to local problems.
And , finally , any talk like this on the future of computing is required to show Moore ' s law , but my favorite version -- this is Gordon Moore ' s original one from his original paper -- and what ' s happened is , year after year after year , we ' ve scaled and we ' ve scaled and we ' ve scaled and we ' ve scaled , and we ' ve scaled and we ' ve scaled , and we ' ve scaled and we ' ve scaled , and there ' s this looming bug of what ' s going to happen at the end of Moore ' s law ; this ultimate bug is coming.
And the killer app for the rest of the planet is the instrumentation and the fabrication divide : people locally developing solutions to local problems . Thank you.

But my subject is national security.
You ' re probably thinking that was my birth year.
A hundred years ago we were looking at coal , of course , and we were looking at whale oil and we were looking at crude oil.
What is the decision point ? 
And the cost annually is three trillion dollars.
Now that includes the cost of military and the cost of the fuel both.
And with that , we have found ourselves to be the world ' s policemen.
Raise your hand if you think you know.
Do we have a corner on the market ? 
So actually most of the 11 we have are tied up in the Mid-East.
And we ' re doing it with four percent of the population.
Does that continue ? 
And when you look at what we ' re using the oil for , 70 percent of it is used for transportation fuel.
When you look at the biggest user and the second largest user , we use 20 million barrels and the Chinese use 10.
If you take the last 10 years and bring forward , you ' ve transferred to OPEC a trillion dollars.
They ' re over.
It ' s what they have to pay for is what we are going to pay for oil. " 
So where are we headed from here ? 
It ' s 25 percent cleaner than oil.
Run it through the separator and you ' re ready to use it.
But here you can look at the list.
Do we have enough natural gas ? 
How does that translate to barrels of oil equivalent ? 
But anyway , whether they say they ' re right or whatever , we have plenty of natural gas.
You take eight million trucks -- these are 18-wheelers -- and take them to natural gas , reduce carbon by 30 percent , it is cheaper and it will cut our imports three million barrels.
I don ' t have to worry about the bridge to where at my age.
Now let me take you -- I ' ve been a realist -- I went from theorist early to realist.
So I think I ' ve made my point that we have to get on our own resources in America.
If we could do that , I think we would take our first step to an energy plan.
What happened ? 
And so the margin is natural gas.
CA : So what happened was that , through increased ability to use fracking technology , the calculated reserves of natural gas kind of exploded and the price plummeted , which made wind uncompetitive.
The first one was Barnett Shale in Texas and then the Marcellus up in the Northeast across New York , Pennsylvania , West Virginia ; and Haynesville in Louisiana.
TBP : Well you say a big investor.
I ' m not a big natural gas producer.
But I also am in the fueling business.
Why doesn ' t that prospect concern you ? 
And so everyone can be at least happy to see a shift from coal or oil to natural gas.
And I said ,  " Bridge to what ? 
CA : But I don ' t think that ' s right , Boone.
Do you support the idea of some kind of price on carbon ? 
The government is not successful on these things.
But that only blew out 500 million.
One , don ' t build a reformer on a fault.
There isn ' t anything wrong with nuke.
Is that a concern ? 
CA : We ' ve got a little bit of accent incompatibility here , you know.
Fracking came out in  ' 47 , and don ' t believe for a minute when our president gets up there and says the Department of Energy 30 years ago developed fracking.
I saw my first one in  ' 53.
There had to have been 800,000 wells fracked in Oklahoma , Texas , Kansas in that aquifer.
Your picture then I guess of how the world eventually gets off fossil fuels is through innovation ultimately , that we ' ll someday make solar and nuclear cost competitive ? 
TBP : How do we get there ? 
LAMTA have been on natural gas for 25 years.
It ' s because of air quality.
CA : All right , so it ' s the bridge fuel.
Yeah , sure , I ' m game for it.
I think there ' s a lot of people who will want to engage with you.
United States,business,entrepreneur,history,innovation,invention,technology,web
You ' re going to see some other speakers today , I already know , who are going to talk about breaking-bones stuff , and , of course , with technology it never is.
And so I think the tempting analogy for the boom-bust that we just went through with the Internet is a gold rush.
The Internet was also very real . This is a real way for humans to communicate with each other . It ' s a big deal.
But you had the same thing with the Gold Rush .  " Gold . Gold . Gold. " 
People would get very excited about this when they read these articles.
And what would happen is -- and the Gold Rush went on for years.
These are community affairs , by the way.
They would take a ship down to Panama , across the isthmus , and then take another ship north.
Same thing happened on the Internet . You get DrKoop.com.
They turned the ships into hotels , because they couldn ' t sail them anywhere.
Half of them deserted to go look for gold.
This is actually from the Klondike Gold Rush . This is the White Pass Trail.
In fact it was so bad that most of the horses died before they could get where they were going.
The inhumanity which this trail has been witness to , the heartbreak and suffering which so many have undergone , cannot be imagined . They certainly cannot be described. " 
 : Bride #1 : You said you had a large selection of invitations . Clerk : But we do.
Husband #2 : Not for another 15 minutes . Announcer : After all , it ' s your special day.
Now , here ' s where our analogy with the Gold Rush starts to diverge , and I think rather severely.
And that was , of course , the very common story.
With the electric industry you actually have to -- one of them is that they ' re both sort of thin , horizontal , enabling layers that go across lots of different industries.
It ' s an incredible means of coordinating , in a very fine-grained way , information flows.
So the light bulb is what wired the world.
This was a huge -- as you would expect -- a huge capital build out.
The Edison Electric Company , which became Edison General Electric , which became General Electric , paid for all of this digging up of the streets . It was incredibly expensive.
How could it grow at 2,300 percent a year in 1994 when people weren ' t really investing in the Web ? 
And the appliances , the golden age of appliances really lasted -- it depends how you want to measure it -- but it ' s anywhere from 40 to 60 years . It goes on a long time.
There ' s asbestos under that handle there.
But three years later , by 1908 , it weighed 40 pounds.
These never really caught on either : the electric shoe warmer and drier . Never a big seller.
We ' d need the right partner . And I thought that really -- I thought that would really work , to give that another shot.
So this was -- remember , they didn ' t wire the houses for electricity.
In fact , if you ' ve seen the Carousel of Progress at Disney World , you ' ve seen this . Here are the cables coming up into this light fixture.
Everybody wanted one of these electric washing machines.
This is the clean rinse-water . So you ' d take the clothes out of here , put them in here , and then you ' d run the clothes through this electric ringer.
And that ' s actually kind of an important point in my presentation , because they hadn ' t invented the off switch.
That ' s what you did . You didn ' t turn it off.
And there was no off switch , so it wasn ' t very good.
First of all , this got installed upside down . This light socket -- and so the cord keeps falling out , so I taped it in.
So we really haven ' t progressed that much since 1908.
I know Ph.D.s in Computer Science -- this process has brought them to tears , absolute tears.
They have to -- typically , they come three times.
By the way , DSL is a kludge.
Every new thing creates two new questions and two new opportunities.
And if you believe that , then stuff like this doesn ' t bother you . This is 1996 :  " All the negatives add up to making the online experience not worth the trouble. " 
And I do think there ' s more innovation ahead of us than there is behind us.
And I think that ' s where we are.
charter for compassion,compassion,evolution,global issues
I ' m going to try to give you a little bit of a natural history of compassion and the golden rule.
The golden rule is great . I ' m a big supporter of both.
I ' m going to argue tonight that compassion and the golden rule are , in a certain sense , built into human nature.
In the beginning , there was compassion , and I mean not just when human beings first showed up , but actually even before that.
So , from a biologist ' s point of view , compassion is actually a gene ' s way of helping itself . OK.
Actually , I think the bad news about kin selection is just that it means that this kind of compassion is naturally deployed only within the family.
Biologists call that  " reciprocal altruism. "  OK.
It ' s not consciously self-serving , but to a biologist , that ' s the logic.
That ' s just human nature.
So , there ' s still work to be done.
So , they do understand that if you want to be treated well , you treat other people well.
I mean , for example , none of us , probably , want to go to prison , but we all think that there are some people who should go to prison . Right ? 
None of us really extends the golden rule in truly diffuse and universal fashion.
We all do that , and you see it all over the world.
So , it ' s these exclusions to the golden rule that amount to a lot of the world ' s trouble.
Now , there ' s one piece of good news I have that may save the world . Okay.
It ' s this non-zero-sumness stuff you just heard a little bit about.
If you ask what kind of a situation is conducive to people becoming friends and allies , the technical answer is a non-zero-sum situation.
So , their fortunes add up to zero.
That ' s a non-zero-sum game.
In a war , two allies are playing a non-zero-sum game.
The deployment of the golden rule most naturally happens along these non-zero-sum channels.
And now I can admit that it might not too , now that I ' ve held your attention for three minutes of technical stuff.
It ' s why social organization has grown from the hunter-gatherer village to the ancient state , the empire , and now here we are in a globalized world.
And you see this all the time in the modern world.
I mean , if you look at the American attitudes toward Japanese during World War II -- look at the depictions of Japanese in the American media as just about subhuman , and look at the fact that we dropped atomic bombs , really without giving it much of a thought -- and you compare that to the attitude now , I think part of that is due to a kind of economic interdependence.
Environmental problems , in many ways , put us all in the same boat.
So , there ' s plenty of non-zero-sumness.
And also , sometimes people don ' t recognize the non-zero-sum dynamics in the world.
And politicians can be aware , and should be aware that , when people around the world are looking at them , are looking at their nation and picking up their cues for whether they are in a zero-sum or a non-zero-sum relationship with a nation -- like , say , America , or any other nation -- human psychology is such that they use cues like : Do we feel we ' re being respected ? 
If there ' s one thing I can encourage everyone to do , politicians , religious leaders , and us , it would be what I call  " expanding the moral imagination "  -- that is to say , your ability to put yourself in the shoes of people in very different circumstances.
Once we define somebody as an enemy , we have trouble putting ourselves in their shoes , just naturally.
Has there ever been somebody who disrespected you so much that you kind of hated them briefly "  ? 
I think it ' s worth the trouble because , again , it just helps us to understand.
I mean , religious leaders are kind of in the inspiration business.
And it ' s going to take real work to change that.

And Alice was unusual partly because , of course , she was a woman , which was pretty rare in the 1950s.
But like every scientist , she appreciated that to make her mark , what she needed to do was find a hard problem and solve it.
Now , Alice had trouble getting funding for her research.
This really was a needle in a haystack sort of search , so she asked everything she could think of.
Did they have indoor or outdoor plumbing ? 
Now that finding flew in the face of conventional wisdom.
Nevertheless , Alice Stewart rushed to publish her preliminary findings in The Lancet in 1956.
The data was out there , it was open , it was freely available , but nobody wanted to know.
So , how did she know that she was right ? 
Alice was very warm , very empathetic with her patients.
He actively sought disconfirmation.
It ' s a fantastic model of collaboration -- thinking partners who aren ' t echo chambers.
So what does that kind of constructive conflict require ? 
And the more I ' ve thought about this , the more I think , really , that that ' s a kind of love.
 " My mother, "  she said ,  " My mother didn ' t enjoy a fight , but she was really good at them. " 
Well , for the most part , they don ' t.
Afraid of the conflict that that would provoke , afraid to get embroiled in arguments that they did not know how to manage , and felt that they were bound to lose.
And it means that people like many of us , who have run organizations , and gone out of our way to try to find the very best people we can , mostly fail to get the best out of them.
So , recently , I worked with an executive named Joe , and Joe worked for a medical device company.
But when he looked around his organization , nobody else seemed to be at all worried.
But he kept worrying about it , and he worried about it so much that he got to the point where he thought the only thing he could do was leave a job he loved.
So now Joe had allies . They could think together.
And when he dared to speak , he discovered much more inside himself and much more give in the system than he had ever imagined.
Well , the University of Delft requires that its PhD students have to submit five statements that they ' re prepared to defend.
The fact is that most of the biggest catastrophes that we ' ve witnessed rarely come from information that is secret or hidden.
But the truth won ' t set us free until we develop the skills and the habit and the talent and the moral courage to use it.
Stewart Brand works on the Clock of the Long Now , a timepiece that counts down the next 10,000 years . It ' s a beautiful project that asks us to think about the far , far future . Here , he discusses a tricky side problem with the Clock : Where can we put it ? 
Welcome to 10,000 feet.
A little background : For 10 years I ' ve been trying to figure out how to hack civilization so that we can get long-term thinking to be automatic and common instead of difficult and rare -- or in some cases , non-existent.
Our core project is a rather ambitious folly -- I suppose , a mythic undertaking : to build a 10,000-year clock that can really keep good time for that long a period.
It ' s about nine feet high.
Alexander Rose came up with this idea of a spiraloid tower with continuous sloping ramps.
Here ' s a beautiful project . They really knew it ' d last forever , because they ' d build it out of absolutely huge stones.
They ' ve been looted inside and out.
Underground in a place that ' s really solid.
So here ' s an image of the long view of the search problem.
Then Roger Kennedy , who was the director of the National Parks Service , led us to Eastern Nevada , to America ' s newest and oldest national park , which is called Great Basin National Park.
This place is remote . It ' s over 200 miles from any major city.
Inside the green line is national forest.
And now let ' s look at the grand truth of what ' s there.
It would be a pilgrimage to get to it ; it would be a serious hike to get up to where the clock is.
It ' s what he calls the seven stages of a mythic adventure.
Then -- this is a nice image of it , there ' s the labyrinth.
Based on -- parts of it are based on an algorithm that Danny Hillis developed , so that a peal of 10 bells makes a different peal every day for 10,000 years.
OK , back to Danny ' s list.
Something you didn ' t expect that caps what you did expect.
At the end of it there ' s something physical , a kind of reward that you take away.
This is not a normal building project.
There ' s possibilities . The borders are important.
They ' re the world ' s oldest living thing.
So when you do tree ring studies of trunks that are on the mountain , some of them go back 10,000 years.
That ' s interesting.
And then , based on that principle , he started looking around at the various trees at Timberline , and realized that the bristlecone pines -- he found some in the White Mountains that were over 4,000 years old.
And we said ,  " Wow , that ' s great . Listen , we ' ll counter . How about zero ? 
This is one of the mines . It doesn ' t have any beryllium in it.
Competent rock is rock that will hold itself up without any shoring.
OK , here ' s another mine that ' s up on top of the property , and it dates back to 1870.
You may recognize a couple of the miners there.
And Alexander Rose on the left there worked with a bunch of people from the National Park to survey the whole mine . It ' s a mile deep.
They don ' t quite meet.
Woke up in the morning -- the mountain was covered with snow.
We want a temporary use permit for the clock , eventually -- 10,000-year temporary use permit.
And there you see a week of weather at 9,400 feet on Mount Washington.
You can hike for days and not encounter anybody.
So you can scratch Lincoln Canyon as an approach.
And you can carry right on up through meadows and steepening forest to the high base of the cliffs at 10,500 feet , where there ' s a bit of a problem.
So Alexander Rose wanted to explore this route , and he started over here on the left from his pickup truck at 8,900 feet and headed up the mountain.
Now , he ' s a rock climber , but you know , he ' s our executive director.
It ' s a secret passage . It ' s like something from Tolkien. " 
In fact , there he is . That ' s Alexander Rose.
How about Zander ' s Crevice ?  No.
Only when you get fresh snow can you see just along the rim there , and that brings it out.
And so that maybe becomes part of the draw and part of the labyrinth.
So here we ' re looking from the south , look north.
And that ' s also timberline and those bristlecones really are shrubs.
We should probably put in a rail or something.
Their herd was reintroduced from Wyoming.
because the real peak is hidden around the corner.
One is the experience of the mountain.
In fact , there are artesian wells where water springs right into the air.
And most of these ranches are having trouble keeping going.
And a scheme emerged that Long Now is looking to see if it might be possible to buy up the whole valley , because those 10 ranches with their 17,000 acres dominate a 500 square mile valley with their grazing allotments and so on , and there ' s a possibility that you could get the whole thing for five million dollars and gradually restore it to its wild condition , and somewhere in the process turn it back over to the National Park , and it would double the size of Great Basin National Park . That would be swell.
It ' s only about 12 feet deep , but what if it were deepened from inside ? 
You ' d have a polished set of passages and chambers in there eventually leading to the 10,000 year clock.
Most of the amazingness of the clock we can borrow from the amazingness of the mountain.
They say ,  " pin peya obe "  -- welcome to the mountain.

And now I really like sort of sitting up , you know.
I walk during the day and I follow people who I think look interesting.
But I do that all the time.
And often , I ' m driving in a taxi and I see a hole in a shirt , or something that looks very interesting or pretty or functional in some way that I ' d never seen happen before.
I don ' t know where inspiration comes from.
I read  " Peter and the Wolf "  with this beautiful band from Juilliard.
And I said , how do I know about Stalinism ? 
I ' m very , very , very inspired by movies.
And I think about , you know , their roles , and about how you have to , like , watch what your daughters look at.
Color is something that motivates me a lot.
How can I ever make anything as beautiful as Greta Garbo ? 
People say , oh , do that . An astrologer tells me to do something.
And there were times when I was actually so desperate I would just , you know , walk into a room and just go like ,  " Eric! " 
I want to show you this clip because I do this kind of crazy thing where I do a cabaret act.
The name of the show is based on this story that I have to tell you about my mother.
I was dating this guy and it was going on for about a year , right.
You know , homosexuality , right ? 
That ' s the name of the show , they eat out , they -- that ' s on my tombstone when I die.
Because it ' s mortifying , and yet it feels ...
And you know , I don ' t say that I do everything well , I just say that I do a lot of things , that ' s all.
But I guess that ' s okay . Right ? 
I will show you this next thing , speaking of costumes for operas.
I ' d been very ingrained in the dance world since I was a teenager.
I don ' t know where it comes from.
There I was in high school , meeting dancers and acting.
And frankly , I don ' t really know what to call myself.
You always have to be slightly bored with everything.
And she makes all the deals.
And if you ever get bored you can look at another thing , and do another thing and talk about it , right ? 
This is one of my favorite clips of Rosie.
IM : Look how cute she looks with this , just a slick back.
I don ' t want to be -- okay . Here we go.
A : Cutting hair ?  Never , never.
IM : Do you have a problem with looking cute ?  You want to look cute.
IM : You read about all these people who have a lot of money and they have kids and the kids always end up somehow , like , really messed up , you know what I mean ? 
But you have to make the decision for yourself.
My God , this is the shortest I ' ve ever had.
A : Oh no , we ' re just staging , ROD : We ' re just staging it.
ROD : Flock of Rosie . Wooo!
Actually , I read this great quote the other day , which was ,  " Style makes you feel great because it takes your mind off the fact that you ' re going to die. " 
I ' ll tell you that I cook a lot also . I love to cook.
How could you show a beat up old dress ? 
So check this out.
It ' s a polymathematical website.
And again , I don ' t say it ' s good , I just think it ' s not boring , right ? 
IM : Yeah , but I can never find buttermilk , ever.
IM : It ' s always low-fat buttermilk.
Let me tell you something interesting.
Chef : Well , here ' s the deal . Let me tell you the deal.
IM : Yeah , exactly.
And that ' s what it was in the early days.
Chef : The reason he thought that is because buttermilk is so wonderfully thick and delicious.
Happy TED . It ' s so wonderful here . I love it . I love it . I love it.
culture,global issues,politics
Have you ever wondered how such a situation can be turned around ? 
I want to share some of that story with you , but also some of my ideas around change and the role of social movements in creating change in Muslim-majority societies.
And then we moved on into an era in the 19th century with the rise of a European nation-state where identities and allegiances were defined by ethnicity.
You could be American-Italian ; you could be American-Irish ; you could be British-Pakistani.
Now this is not all necessarily good news , because it ' s also my belief that hatred has gone global just as much as love.
Now I should know , because for 13 years of my life , I was involved in an extreme Islamist organization.
Anyone who ' s from England knows the reputation we have from Essex.
At the age of 21 , I was co-founding this organization in Pakistan.
We felt they were from the age of yesteryear.
Eventually I was detected , of course , in Egypt.
And it ' s not just Islamist extremists that did this.
What ' s actually happening is that what were previously localized parochialisms , individual or groupings of extremists who were isolated from one another , have become interconnected in a globalized way and have thus become , or are becoming , mainstream.
In others , headscarves are being banned.
Now that never would have been possible before.
And I ' ll give you an example here at this stage.
In the meanwhile , the Old mentality with a capital O , was represented by his father , the head of the Nigerian bank , warning the CIA that his own son was about to attack , and this warning fell on deaf ears.
So why are they succeeding ? 
It ' s comprised of ideas and narratives and symbols and leaders.
Incidentally , the difference between ideas and narratives : the idea is the cause that one believes in ; and the narrative is the way to sell that cause -- the propaganda , if you like , of the cause.
So these symbols and these leaders come to your mind immediately.
Which means , by definition , that particular leader no longer exists.
So that begs the next question.
Because those who aspire to democratic culture are in power , or have societies that are leading globalized , powerful societies , powerful countries.
Yet actually , whenever we talk about human rights , we do say that human rights are universal.
And then you have a third party saying ,  " Vote for us ; we ' ll establish a theocracy. " 
Let ' s bring the military back again. " 
When talking about those reasons , let ' s break down certain preconceptions.
Statistically , they are educated , on average , above the education levels of Western society.
And what I believe is missing is genuine grassroots activism on the ground , in addition to international aid , in addition to education , in addition to health.
Whereas Islamists and far-right organizations , for decades , have been building demand for their ideology on the grassroots.
And what ' s needed is a genuine transnational youth-led movement that works to actively advocate for the democratic culture -- which is necessarily more than just elections.
So what ' s needed is those organizations on the ground advocating for the democratic culture itself to create the demand on the ground for this culture.
But to get to that stage , where democracy builds the fabric of society and the political choices within that fabric , but are certainly not theocratic and military dictatorship -- i.e . you ' re voting in a democracy , in an existing democracy , and that democracy is not merely one of the choices at the ballot box.
The Arab uprisings have demonstrated that this is already beginning.
We need to see how we can help those societies move from political coalitions , loosely based political coalitions , to civilizational coalitions that are working for the ideals and narratives of the democratic culture on the ground.
So when Arab socialism started in Egypt , it spread across the region.
And we ' ve made a start for that in Pakistan with a movement called Khudi , where we are working on the ground to encourage the youth to create genuine buy-in for the democratic culture.
While news from Iran streams to the world , Clay Shirky shows how Facebook , Twitter and TXTs help citizens in repressive regimes to report on real news , bypassing censors  . The end of top-down control of news is changing the nature of politics.
I want to talk about the transformed media landscape , and what it means for anybody who has a message that they want to get out to anywhere in the world.
And there was some concern that in some parts of the country there might be voter suppression.
So this is a pattern that assumes we ' re all in this together.
It ' s when everybody is able to take them for granted.
Not to put too fine a point on it , the moment we ' re living through -- the moment our historical generation is living through -- is the largest increase in expressive capability in human history.
Then , a couple of hundred years ago , there was innovation in two-way communication , conversational media : first the telegraph , then the telephone.
This is the media landscape as we knew it in the 20th century.
And the media that ' s good at creating groups is no good at creating conversations.
And this is what changed.
Whereas the phone gave us the one-to-one pattern , and television , radio , magazines , books , gave us the one-to-many pattern , the Internet gives us the many-to-many pattern.
And that means that every medium is right next door to every other medium.
It ' s as if , when you bought a book , they threw in the printing press for free ; it ' s like you had a phone that could turn into a radio if you pressed the right buttons.
It ' s still changing patterns even among groups who know how to deal with the Internet well.
People were texting from their phones . They were taking photos of buildings.
And so as the quake was happening the news was reported.
The last time China had a quake of that magnitude it took them three months to admit that it had happened.
And this stuff rippled like wildfire.
But nine of the 10 in those first hours.
And then this happened.
A local official literally prostrated himself in the street , in front of these protesters , in order to get them to go away.
And so the protest kept going.
They began to shut down the media that the protests were happening on.
But like the Maginot Line , the great firewall of China was facing in the wrong direction for this challenge , because not one of those four things was true in this environment.
And in fact that is happening this week.
They also affect people who want to send messages , because this is really a transformation of the ecosystem as a whole , not just a particular strategy.
National message . Targeted individuals.
All of that is over.
And that ' s a little freaky . But you can get used to it after a while , as people do.
Those days are over , never to return.
And one of the things Obama did , was they famously , the Obama campaign did , was they famously put up And millions of citizens rushed in to participate , and to try and figure out how to help.
By the summer , in the middle of the general campaign , He said ,  " I ' ve thought about the issue more . I ' ve changed my mind.
 " Please get FISA right. " 
And he said essentially ,  " I have considered the issue.
This didn ' t please anybody . But then a funny thing happened in the conversation.
And that is the kind of discipline that it takes to make really mature use of this media.
And the choice we face , I mean anybody who has a message they want to have heard anywhere in the world , isn ' t whether or not that is the media environment we want to operate in.
Thank you very much.

This is an incident which occurred on Mount Everest ; it was the worst disaster in the history of Everest.
It ' s 29,035 feet high.
Everest is an extreme environment.
It ' s actually a wind-chill factor which is lower than a summer day on Mars.
It starts at base camp , at 17,500 feet.
And then Camp Four is the highest camp ; that ' s 3,000 feet short of the summit.
And this is what they unloaded for me : I had four yak loads of medical supplies , which are dumped in a tent , and here I am trying to arrange things.
And , after actually two months of preparation , we built our camps all the way up the mountain.
This is near the top of the icefall.
This is me crossing a crevasse.
Okay . This is Camp One.
They ' re on fixed ropes here.
If you notice , the summit of Everest is black.
This is on the way up from Camp Three to Camp Four , moving in , up through the clouds.
This is a picture of Rob Hall.
They ' re up at Camp Four , and you can see that there ' s wind blowing off the summit.
This looks like a good chance to go for the summit.
So that ' s what happened.
From here , it ' s about 1,500 feet up at a 30-degree angle to the summit.
And there were climbers on that summit ridge.
This is all you ' ve got . You ' re very exposed on the summit ridge.
So each person climbs individually.
But , either way , you fall for the rest of your life.
It was the worst winds I ' ve ever seen.
Rob Hall , we heard by radio , was up here , at this point in the storm with Doug Hansen.
There were still 18 other climbers that we weren ' t aware of their condition.
Our two strongest climbers , Todd Burleson and Pete Athans , decided to go up to try to rescue who they could even though there was a ferocious storm going.
There ' s no chance of saving him , and just try to save yourself at this point. " 
I gave them radio advice from Camp Three , and we sent down the climbers that could make it down under their own power.
And they all came by me so I could take a look at them and see what I could do for them , which is really not much , because Camp Three is a little notch cut in the ice in the middle of a 45-degree angle.
So , as the climbers came by me , I sort of assessed whether or not they were in condition to continue on further down.
While I was taking care of them , we got more news about Rob Hall.
But Rob was now too weak to come down himself , and with the fierce winds and up at that altitude , he was just beyond rescue and he knew it.
They picked the name for their baby.
This was my medical kit.
And this was scene at the lower camp.
This is some severe frostbite on the feet , severe frostbite on the nose.
I expected him to be incoherent , but , in fact , he walked into the tent and said to me ,  " Hi , Ken . Where should I sit ?  " 
You can see his hand is completely white ; his face , his nose , is burned.
He said he had gotten lost in the storm , collapsed in the snow , and just laid there , unable to move.
So the climbers passed him by , and Beck lay there for a day , a night and another day , in the snow.
After laying in the snow that long a time , he got up and found his way back to the camp.
And I can only try to speculate on how he did it.
This measures dynamic blood flow and therefore energy flow within the brain.
This is a roughly normal scan , showing equal distribution of energy.
These parts of the brain are quieting down.
He ' s running out of energy.
He ' s dying.
He ' s developing energy in this area through thought.
This is where people make decisions , where they develop willpower.
And you can see here , he ' s starting to get more energy into the frontal lobe.
And then , that energy is sort of spreading throughout his thought areas.
So this is what I can speculate might have been going on had we been able to do a SPECT scan on Beck during this survival epic.
A helicopter came in at 21,000 feet and carried out the highest helicopter rescue in history.
These are Serphas lighting juniper branches.
This was Scott Fischer , Rob Hall , Andy Harris , Doug Hansen and Yasuko Namba.
These Sherpas believe that if you write prayers on these flags , the message will be carried up to the gods , and that year , Beck ' s message was answered.

Slowly ideas lead to ideology , lead to policies that lead to actions.
So ideas change states.
The second set of ideas I call  " ideas in progress. " 
Because when you are a developing country in the world where you can see the problems that other countries are having , you can actually anticipate what that did and do things very differently.
We thought of people as a liability.
And this change in thinking of human capital is linked to the fact that India is going through a demographic dividend.
In other words , it will be the only young country in an aging world.
But a demographic dividend is only as good as the investment in your human capital.
The second thing in India has been the change in the role of entrepreneurs.
The third big thing I believe that has changed India is our attitude towards the English language.
And the fact that we have English is now becoming a huge strategic asset.
Forty percent of those prepaid phones are recharged at less than 20 cents at each recharge.
They didn ' t want the unions to believe that they were actually computers.
Again , after having lived for more than 200 years under the East India Company and under imperial rule , Indians had a very natural reaction towards globalization believing it was a form of imperialism.
When democracy came to India 60 years back it was an elite concept.
I believe these six factors -- the rise of the notion of population as human capital , the rise of Indian entrepreneurs , the rise of English as a language of aspiration , technology as something empowering , globalization as a positive factor , and the deepening of democracy -- has contributed to why India is today growing at rates it has never seen before.
One is the question of education.
Even in the slums of India more than 50 percent of urban kids are going into private schools.
Similarly , infrastructure -- for a long time , infrastructure was not a priority.
It is reflected in the political statements.
So I do believe this is an idea which has arrived , but simply not implemented.
And that is reflected in the kinds of situations that you see.
The final thing is the notion of India as a single market -- because when you didn ' t think of India as a market , you didn ' t really bother about a single market , because it didn ' t really matter.
So there is a form of internal globalization which is happening , which is as important as external globalization.
These are the arguments we have which cause gridlock.
It ' s also related to the way that we subsidize our people , and all the left and right arguments that we have.
The second one is the labor policies that we have , which make it so difficult for entrepreneurs to create standardized jobs in companies , that 93 percent of Indian labor is in the unorganized sector.
At the same time give a policy for a lot more people to be in the formal sector , and create the jobs for the millions of people that we need to create jobs for.
It ' s very difficult for a foreign university to come to India.
Here India can look at what is happening in the west and elsewhere , and look at what needs to be done.
We can use technology for transparency , and many other things.
Therefore we ' re to rethink the whole way we look at health.
And then again , India does not have the luxury of making its environment dirty , because it has to marry environment and development.
But if India grows at something like eight percent , income per year per person will go to 16 times by 2050.
Why does what ' s happening 10 thousand miles away matter to all of you ? 
And it is important to prove that growth and democracy are not incompatible , that you can have a democracy , that you can have an open society , and you can have growth.
You know if you look at the development in the West over 200 years , the average growth may have been about two percent.
When the economic growth goes to eight percent and population growth drops to 1.5 percent , then per capita income is doubling every nine years.

I ' m afraid I ' m one of those speakers you hope you ' re not going to meet at TED.
I ' m much more trying to add to some of the questions we ' re talking about.
Basically you believe in complexity , but not in ambiguity.
So now when you know what to expect , let ' s give you the story.
And when the votes had been counted , three-fourths of the people have voted with a blank ballot.
But what to do about people who are voting with a blank ballot ? 
This is the opening of a beautiful novel by Jose Saramago called  " Seeing. " 
The problem is that many people start to believe that it is not a game worth playing.
Because especially now with the economic crisis , you can see that the trust in politics , that the trust in democratic institutions , was really destroyed.
And the question which I want to ask is the following : How did it happen that we are living in societies which are much freer than ever before -- we have more rights , we can travel easier , we have access to more information -- at the same time that trust in our democratic institutions basically has collapsed ? 
And the first was the cultural and social revolution of 1968 and 1970s , which put the individual at the center of politics.
But after that you have the market revolution of the 1980s.
And it was the birth of the global world.
The very idea of political community totally has changed.
Because first you have the 1960s and 1970s , cultural and social revolution , which in a certain way destroyed the idea of a collective purpose.
And it is so difficult to engage people in politics when they believe that what really matters is where they personally stand.
Now we have the reverse tendency.
When the Soviet Union was still there , the rich and the powerful , they needed the people , because they feared them.
So as a result of it , you have this very strange situation in which the elites basically got out of the control of the voters.
I know that many people here have been splendidly speaking about the digital world and the possibility for cooperation , but [have you] seen what the digital world has done to American politics these days ? 
What really matters is basically to manipulate the emotions of the people.
Now the revolutions are called under the medium which is most used.
And when we ' re now trying to see how we can change the situation , when basically we ' re trying to see what can be done about democracy , we should keep this ambiguity in mind.
This is probably true.
We are assuming that our societies are going to be based on mistrust.
But when politics is only management of mistrust , then -- I ' m very glad that  " 1984 "  has been mentioned -- now we ' re going to have  " 1984 "  in reverse.
Are you not afraid with all these technologies that are going to track down any statement the politicians are going to make on certain issues , are you not afraid that this is going to be a very strong signal to politicians to repeat their positions , even the very wrong positions , because consistency is going to be more important than common sense ? 
So for me this is extremely important.
In a small country that could be my country , but could be also your country , they took a decision -- it is a real case story -- that all of the governmental decisions , discussions of the council of ministers , were going to be published on the Internet 24 hours after the council discussions took place.
Because it ' s going to be very difficult for them to dissent knowing that 24 hours after this is going to be on the public space , and this is in a certain way going to be a political crisis. "

Deborah Scranton on her  " War Tapes " 
So I went to bed that night pretty excited.
And I had this idea : what if I could , in effect , virtually embed , and create a permeable relationship with the soldiers ? 
He ' s like ,  " Yes , Deborah ?  " 
I picked one unit -- Charlie Company , Third of the 172nd , they ' re mountain infantry -- for two reasons.
This was a big thing that I think when Major H told me , I wasn ' t really totally gathering what that would mean.
I started with the 1607 Massachusetts Bay Colony Pequot Indian Wars.
So , I want to show the trailer , and then I ' m going to take apart one scene in detail.
Zack Bazzi : Do I really want to go ?  Probably not.
Voice : The real deal , man! Narrator : You ready ? 
SP : If you let fear get to you , then you ' re not going to be doing your job.
Soldiers : IV! Are we on fire ?  IV!
MM : This little kid is in the middle of a war zone.
SP : You don ' t put 150,000 troops in there , and say we ' re there to create democracy.
Jon Baril : The worst thing in my life.
Kevin Shangraw : The Iraqi people are who we are there to help -- and we just killed one.
I hope.
I don ' t know how many of you might imagine it , but there ' s actually a TEDster who recently got back from Iraq.
We were one of the lucky ones to get in the class with the Sony cameras and the Vista software.
I mean , we were there for an hour , talking.
How do we open it up to really be able to have a conversation ? 
I really related to what James was saying yesterday , because I ' m behind the camera.
The guys '  tapes on average took two weeks to get from Iraq to me.
The reason I quantify that is because we really embarked on this as a mutual journey to really get inside of it.
SP : We like to give these insurgents a fair chance.
It ' s not true . Very unsafe.
Be advised , we ' re leaving Taji right now.
Soldiers : Get your vest on!
Soldier : I ' ll walk you through it.
Probably 20 dead , at least 20 or 30 wounded Iraqis.
They just removed a burnt body , or half a body from here.
And that ' s it , that ' s all that ' s left.
I later heard that Iraqi casualties were not to be treated in Taji.
21:00 hours , and it ' s just our squad going through today ' s events in our heads , whether we want to or not.
I feel exploited and proud at the same time.
Because these pages smell like Linds , and there won ' t be any time for jerking off tomorrow.
It ' s a new way of trying to make a documentary.
The way I learned about Taji was Steve Pink sent me an email , and in it , attached a photo of that burned body out at the car.
Because the thing that very often is missing is , in the military what they call  " hot wash. " 
So , in order to get the intimacy , to share that experience with you , the guys -- the two most popular mounts -- there was a camera on the turret , the gun turret , and then on the dashboard of the Humvee.
Steve Pink reading his journal happened five months after he came home.
Now , the news footage I put in there to try to show -- you know , I think mainstream media tries to do the best they can in the format that they have.
They didn ' t have to go outside the wire.
And I think it ' s such an amazing gift that they would share this as a way of bridging.
And we have to be able to go into scary places where we may , you know , we think we know.
I ' ll share one story.
Or you know , these things.
And for me , one of the most profound stories someone shared with me , that then became my story , was -- for those of you who haven ' t seen the film , and it ' s not a spoiler -- it ' s very common there are a lot of civilian accidents , where people get in front of Humvees and they get killed.
And he looked at me , and I smiled , and then I saw the tears start welling up in his eyes.
The gunner was throwing candy.
And I ' m a father . I have children.
And he said ,  " I ' m going to bring her to see your film.
And often , I ' ll hear people say , who maybe know that I did this film , and they say ,  " Oh , you know , I ' m against the war , but I support the soldiers. " 
Do you , if you find out your neighbor ' s been , do you spend some time ? 
I think , I challenge us to say -- to operationalize those terms , when we say we support someone , you know ? 
And really do give them a hug.

It is unbelievably bad.
Only nine percent is passenger cars , interestingly enough.
And we said we could redesign the 115-year-old gypsum drywall process that generates 20 billion pounds of CO2 a year.
There is the inside of our lab . We haven ' t shown this before.
We don ' t build this production equipment any longer in the U.S. , unfortunately.
That ' s the finished production line there.
These are people who worked this project for two to three years.
We signed the first panel just a few weeks after that , had a great signing ceremony , leading to people hopefully using these products across the world.
So here is what we learned : 8,000 gallons of gas equivalent to build one house.
Don ' t listen to the people who say you can ' t do this , because anyone can.
Two and a half million cars worth of gypsum , you know , CO2 generated . Right ? 
So my hope is that when you leave TED , you will look at reducing your carbon footprint in however you can do it.
Thank you so much.

13 years -- for some of you , you can empathize with that number.
So let ' s first talk about focused ultrasound.
So you see , it ' s all intact , completely transparent.
On the right-hand side , you see an ultrasonic transducer.
It ' s just a lesion formed inside.
So this is , I think , the first kosher Hippocratic surgical system.
But ultrasound can be shaped to be anything in between , because it ' s a mechanical force.
So this idea of harnessing focused ultrasound to treat lesions in the brain is not new at all.
And it makes you ponder why those pioneers failed.
So this is how it looks , you know , the operating room of the future today.
One of the neurological conditions that can be treated with focused ultrasound are movement disorders , like Parkinson ' s or essential tremor.
So he suffered from essential tremor for many years.
It is approved under an FDAIDE at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville using focused ultrasound to ablate a point in his thalamus.
So we put the patient on the MR table.
I don ' t have a pointer here , but you see the green , sort of rectangle or trapezoid ? 
So once those pictures are acquired and the physician has drawn all the necessary safety limits and so on , he selects basically a point -- you see the round point in the middle where the cursor is -- and he presses this blue button called  " sonicate. " 
So he presses  " sonicate, "  and this is what happens.
It elevates the temperature.
And one of the unique capabilities that we leverage with the MR is the ability to measure temperature noninvasively.
And you can see the points there on the graph.
So once the physician verifies that the focus spot is on the target he has chosen , then we move to perform a full-energy ablation like you see here.
This is an immediate relief.
He said ,  " Miraculous. " 
I mean , those people lose their independence.
And he also plays golf , like you do in Virginia when you are retired.
He suffers from no neurodeficit.
Pain is something that can make your life miserable.
He ' s a 78 year-old farmer who suffered from -- how should I say it ?  -- it ' s called pain in the butt.
Many patients like that favor radiation therapy.
He had to sit on a cushion , stand still , not move , because it was very painful.
He returned again to his daily routine on the farm.
But now , you ask me , but what about war , the war on cancer ? 
The good news : there ' s a lot that can be done.
I don ' t see , without this nation taking it as some collective will or something that is a national goal to make that happen , it will not happen.
And we have better-than-surgery results in breasts.
Well , there are other cancer tumors in the abdomen -- quite lethal , very lethal actually -- pancreas , liver , kidney.
But I have now a message to the ladies.
And sometimes , they cannot even conceive and become pregnant because of the fibroid.
She was offered a hysterectomy , but this is an inconceivable proposition for someone who wants to keep her pregnancy option.
So in conclusion , I ' d like to leave you with actually four messages.
He can stop the surgery at any moment.
business,creativity,culture,design,fashion,law,media
She ' s an Italian fashion designer.
She ' s looking at the seams . She ' s looking at the construction.
But to a fashionista , what it really is is a sign of Prada ' s genius : that she can root through the history of fashion and pick the one jacket that doesn ' t need to be changed by one iota , and to be current and to be now.
They have trademark protection , but no copyright protection and no patent protection to speak of.
It ' s because it ' s a lot harder for knock-off artists to knock off these designs because they can ' t knock off the logo.
And sometimes these are fun , right ? 
But too utilitarian ?  I mean is that the way you think of fashion ? 
What I ' m going to argue today is that because there ' s no copyright protection in the fashion industry , fashion designers have actually been able to elevate utilitarian design , things to cover our naked bodies , into something that we consider art.
They ' re also notorious for riffing off of the zeitgeist.
Now , fashion designers have the broadest palette imaginable in this creative industry.
People think this is a magical thing . How does it happen ? 
Now , the fast fashion giants have probably benefited the most from the lack of copyright protection in the fashion industry.
When you look at copies like this , you wonder : How do the luxury high-end brands remain in business ? 
Here ' s what he had to say.
The people on Santee Alley are not the ones who shop at Gucci.
There ' s lots of virtues of copying.
Because of fast fashion , global trends actually get established much more quickly than they used to.
And so , they want to move on to the next trend as soon as possible.
Now of course , there ' s a bunch of effects that this culture of copying has on the creative process.
He came up with this Bowden-wedge heel that has to be made out of steel or titanium ; if you make it from some sort of cheaper material , it ' ll actually crack in two.
He said that one of the reasons he invented bebop was that he was pretty sure that white musicians wouldn ' t be able to replicate the sound.
I love these Gallianos.
So when one-liners were really popular , everybody stole them from one another.
If somebody steals a joke from Larry David , for instance , it ' s not as funny.
Now , some fashion designers will say ,  " It ' s only in the United States that we don ' t have any respect.
And that ' s sort of like the novelty standard for a U.S . patent , which fashion designers never get -- rarely get here in the states.
It turns out it ' s because the novelty standard is too low.
are Nike T-shirts that are almost identical to one another.
I don ' t think the legislation is going anywhere , because they realized it is so hard to tell the difference between a pirated design and something that ' s just part of a global trend.
You know , it ' s not just the fashion industry that doesn ' t have copyright protection.
It doesn ' t matter how wacky they look or how cool they look , you cannot copyright the sculptural design.
Hairdos , no copyright protection.
Tattoo artists , they don ' t want it ; it ' s not cool.
And some of these industries may seem sort of marginal to you , but these are the gross sales for low I.P . industries , industries with very little copyright protection , and there ' s the gross sales of films and books.
It ' s embarrassing. " 
I want a picture. "  And the lawyers do not provide a picture , so I made one.
Then it deserves protection.
The other one is : Is it an idea ? 
The problem is that digital technology has completely subverted the logic of this physically fixed , expression versus idea concept.
And these things , because we can copy and transmit them so easily , actually circulate within our culture a lot more like ideas than like physically instantiated objects.
He ' s smart , he ' s smart.
And I really want to thank Veronica Jauriqui for making this very fashionable presentation.

This individual lives in the Atacama Desert in Chile , and it happens to be 3,000 years old.
There ' s an environmental component.
The tree was in part a catalyst for the project.
I think it was my longstanding desire to bring together my interest in art , science and philosophy that allowed me to be ready when the proverbial light bulb went on.
Visiting Greenland was more like traveling back in time than just traveling very far north.
And it ' s not like you could send them a text or shoot them an e-mail , so I was literally left to my own devices.
And then , of course , there ' s the lichens.
And if the title  " Searching for Armillaria Death Rings, "  sounds ominous , it is.
So I ' m not sure if there are any in this photo , but I do know the fungus is down there.
And then from underground to underwater.
And you ' ll see , there ' s some damage to the surface of the coral.
Now this is something that I think is one of the most quietly resilient things on the planet.
So what you have is one giant , interconnected , genetically identical individual that ' s been living for 80,000 years.
The location of this tree is actually kept secret for its own protection.
This is the Fortingall Yew -- no , I ' m just kidding -- this is the Fortingall Yew.
Rachel Sussman : 300 ?  No , 175 is the oldest living tortoise , so nowhere near 2,000.
So that being said , it ' s highly unlikely that any jellyfish would survive that long in the wild.
And now down to another part of the world.
And you know , I think of all of these organisms as palimpsests.
So the Baobabs , as they get older , tend to get pulpy in their centers and hollow out.
And what ' s more , it ' s actually a tree.
And it actually never sheds those leaves , so it also bears the distinction of having the longest leaves in the plant kingdom.
This is something called an underground forest.
The tree can easily recover.
If you ' ve been in the American West , you know the Creosote bush is pretty ubiquitous , but that being said , you see that this has this unique , circular form.
This is the clonal Mojave yucca , it ' s about a mile away , and it ' s a little bit older than 12,000 years.
In fact , this land is designated for recreational all-terrain vehicle use.
And what they found , by doing research into the permafrost , was this bacteria.
This is a map that I ' ve put together of the oldest living things , so you can get a sense of where they are ; you see they ' re all over the world.
So , I probably have about two more years left on this project -- on this phase of the project , but after five years , I really feel like I know what ' s at the heart of this work.
It ' s my hope that , by going to find these organisms , that I can help draw attention to their remarkable resilience and help play a part in insuring their continued longevity into the foreseeable future.

They want to be part of it.
I don ' t want to disappoint my family or friends. " 
Will I not make enough money ? 
And nothing important happens in life without a cost. " 
One of my favorite quotes from literature was written by Tillie Olsen , the great American writer from the South.
What is the cost of not trying ? 
And when we would gather as fellows , she would push us to think about how the elders in Native American culture make decisions.
And whenever we would gather the fellows after that , we would leave a chair empty for her spirit.
And I met them in the early  ' 90s.
They said they would try so hard to remember the fragments of the dance , hoping that others were alive and doing the same.
And I sat there in the studio watching these women clapping their hands -- beautiful rhythms -- as these little fairy pixies were dancing around them , wearing these beautiful silk colors.
I also have been touched by the dark side of power and leadership.
We built this institution based on social justice , gender equity , this idea of empowering women.
And I would visit her in the prisons , sitting side-by-side , knees touching , and I would have to admit to myself that monsters exist in all of us , but that maybe it ' s not monsters so much , but the broken parts of ourselves , sadnesses , secret shame , and that ultimately it ' s easy for demagogues to prey on those parts , those fragments , if you will , and to make us look at other beings , human beings , as lesser than ourselves -- and in the extreme , to do terrible things.
And that , when they sit on those street corners and all they can think of in the future is no job , no education , no possibility , well then it ' s easy to understand how the greatest source of status can come from a uniform and a gun.
And they ' re incredible guys.
And I have learned so much from Chris and Kevin and Alex and Herbert and all of these young men.
What we really yearn for as human beings is to be visible to each other.
And my hat ' s off to you in Kibera.
I know it works.
But we find those entrepreneurs who put people and the planet before profit.
Last May I had this extraordinary 24-hour period where I saw two visions of the world living side-by-side -- one based on violence and the other on transcendence.
But less than 24 hours , I was 13 miles away from those mosques , visiting one of our Acumen investees , an incredible man , Jawad Aslam , who dares to live a life of immersion.
He stood on moral ground and refused to pay bribes.
And there ' s schools and clinics and shops.
He said ,  " Long story.
We need that kind of moral leadership and courage in our worlds.
Or we can take the much more difficult path of transformation , transcendence , compassion and love , but also accountability and justice.
And every day he would watch her , and it looked like she was talking to the people.
What are you saying ?  " 
But she became part of history and opened up this idea that all of us should have access to education.
But especially when I was talking to the African women , I sometimes made these mistakes -- it was so hard for me to learn how to listen. " 
We need leaders.
And it is in the total of all those acts that the history of this generation will be written.
http://www.ted.com/talks/siegfried_woldhek_shows_how_he_found_the_true_face_of_leonardo.html
Siegfried Woldhek shows how he found the true face of Leonardo
But we do not know his face.
Is this the face of Leonardo da Vinci or isn ' t it ? 
But no faces ? 
So let ' s try to find them.
Which ones of these could be self-portraits ? 
So we can also eliminate the ones that are very vague or very stylized.
And here they are.
I ' ve made more than 1,100 portraits myself for newspapers , over the course of 300 -- 30 years , sorry , 30 years only.
And hold onto your seats , because if we zoom in on those faces , remark how they have the same broad forehead , the horizontal eyebrows , the long nose , the curved lips and the small , well-developed chin.
Now , are they made in the right order ? 
What was the age of Leonardo at the time ?  Does that fit ? 
Well , we need a reference.
The statue is the reference , and it connects the identity of Leonardo to those three faces.
Here he is : Leonardo da Vinci.

And it ' s constructed for change . It ' s all about change.
Isn ' t she fabulous ? 
In fact there is little evidence that there is any cognitive ability in a very young infant.
It would be several months before this infant could do something as simple as reach out and grasp under voluntary control an object and retrieve it , usually to the mouth.
It has stored , recorded , can fastly retrieve the meanings of thousands , tens of thousands of objects , actions , and their relationships in the world.
This brain is very much a thinking machine.
Now movement has advanced to the point where it can actually control movement simultaneously , in a complex sequence , in complex ways as would be required for example for playing a complicated game , like soccer.
And if you did he ' d probably be from Sao Paulo.
And in fact they result in a wonderful differentiation in humankind , in the way that , in fact , no two of us are quite alike.
And we try to track the changes that occur as the new skill or ability is acquired.
From these studies we defined two great epochs of the plastic history of the brain.
All it takes for example in the sound domain , is exposure to sound.
The sound doesn ' t have to be valuable to the animal : I could raise the animal in something that could be hypothetically valuable , like the sounds that simulate the sounds of a native language of a child.
I can raise an animal under conditions that would be equivalent to raising a baby under a moderately loud ceiling fan , in the presence of continuous noise.
And they account for , for example the beautiful evolution of a language-specific processor in every normally developing baby.
The input doesn ' t really have to be meaningful.
And in this epoch , which extends from late in the first year of life to death ; it ' s actually doing this under behavioral control.
This is actually very powerful.
So here is a very simple experiment.
So in the beginning the monkey could not perform this task at all.
But the monkey gradually developed a strategy.
We can look down in the brain of the monkey.
Now this is a map , down in the surface of the brain , in which , in a very elaborate experiment we ' ve reconstructed the responses , location by location , in a highly detailed response mapping of the responses of its neurons.
These are the surfaces the monkey is using to manipulate the tool.
And yet now it ' s represented in substantially finer grain.
And each one of them changes in ways that are specific to the skill or ability.
There are 15 or 20 cortical areas that are changed specifically when you learn a simple skill like this.
This is constructed by physical change.
The changes are massive.
It ' s what ' s rewarding to you.
That is why you , in your many skills and abilities , are a unique specialist : a specialist that ' s vastly different in your physical brain in detail than the brain of an individual 100 years ago ; enormously different in the details from the brain of the average individual 1,000 years ago.
Now overwhelmingly the most powerful context that ' s occurred in your brain is you.
It ' s constructed . It ' s created in your brain.
I ' m going to talk about using these strategies to actually design brain plasticity-based approach to drive corrections in the machinery of a child that increases the competence of the child as a language receiver and user and , thereafter , as a reader.
We now have a large body of literature that demonstrates that the fundamental problem that occurs in the majority of children that have early language impairments , and that are going to struggle to learn to read , is that their language processor is created in a defective form.
And there are a lot of things that contribute to that.
We knew that they were going to be slow cognitively ; we knew they were going to struggle to learn to develop normal language abilities ; and we knew that they were going to struggle to learn to read.
We don ' t hear about that anymore . Where did it go ? 
Every sound the child hears uncorrected is muffled.
It ' s muffled English . It ' s degraded Japanese.
And then the child is stuck with it.
There are many inherited faults that can make it noisier.
And you can look in the brain of such a child and record those time constants.
Of course they will . Because as a receiver of language , they are receiving it and representing it , and in information it ' s representing crap.
And you are going to have corresponding abnormal neurology.
Changing it in detail . It takes about 30 hours on the average.
So here we ' re looking at the normal distribution.
This is in a broad assessment of their language abilities.
Think of a classroom of children in the language arts.
And an important language dependent skill is enabled by this training -- that is to say reading.
Now you can also take the same approach to address problems in aging.
And you can actually look down on the brain of such an individual and witness a change in the time constants and space constants with which , for example , the brain is representing language again.
These are 80- to 90-year-olds.
It means that most people who are at risk for senility , more or less immediately , are now in a protected position.
And in older age conditions like Parkinsonism , and in other acquired impairments like schizophrenia.
Get ready for it . It ' s going to be a part of every life not too far in the future , just like physical exercise is a part of every well organized life in the contemporary period.
It will be a long time before they really understand it.
When he realized his wife had to choose between buying family meals and buying her monthly  " supplies, "  Arunachalam Muruganantham vowed to help her solve the problem of the sanitary pad . His research got very very personal -- and led him to a powerful business model.
It makes me to stand here , the fame , the money I got out of it.
I saw .  " What is that ?  "  I asked.
Then I understood this -- adapting that unhygienic method to manage her period days.
And it ' s called affordability.
I don ' t know why . I did not ask for a condom.
They are not going to touch that , because it ' s not your matter.
It ' s not like I can just check it in the lab.
Then I made a sanitary pad and handed it to Shanti -- my wife ' s name is Shanti.
Because it ' s an arranged marriage , not a love marriage.
That ' s why I am always jealous with the saints in India.
Then I used , tried to use the medical college girls.
I wore a sanitary pad . I filled animal blood in a football bottle , I tied it up here , there is a tube going into my panties , while I ' m walking , while I ' m cycling , I made a press , doses of blood will go there.
But I am also trying to make sanitary pad with the good cotton . It ' s not working.
Why is this ?  I used medical college girls.
In this machine , any rural woman can apply the same raw materials that they are processing in the multinational plant , anyone can make a world-class napkin at your dining hall.
A lot of people making a lot of money , billion , billions of dollars accumulating.
That ' s why I am giving this machine only in rural India , for rural women , because in India , [you ' ll be] surprised , only two percent of women are using sanitary pads . The rest , they ' re using a rag cloth , a leaf , husk , [saw] dust , everything except sanitary pads.
A school dropout from Coimbatore , how he is able to sustaining ? 
She replied immediately ,  " I know about napkins , but if I start using napkins , then we have to cut our family milk budget. " 
AM : And previously , you need a multimillion investment for machine and all . Now , any rural woman can.
I ' m sustaining on seventh year.
That ' s why I ' m not running after this bloody money.
Like that , I never chased Mahalakshmi.
I am becoming a solution provider . I ' m very happy.
So I classify the people into three : uneducated , little educated , surplus educated.
Lewis Pugh talks about his record-breaking swim across the North Pole . He braved the icy waters to highlight the melting icecap . Watch for astonishing footage -- and some blunt commentary on the realities of supercold-water swims.
Today I want to talk to you about swimming across the North Pole , across the most northern place in the whole world.
And one of the stories he told me so often when I was a young boy was of the first British atomic bomb test.
And I know that watching that atomic bomb going off had a very , very big impact on my late father.
He loved history . He would tell me about Captain Scott walking all the way to the South Pole and Sir Edmund Hillary climbing up Mount Everest.
And , well , sometimes it takes a long time for a dream to come true.
But I have seen that place change beyond all description , just in that short period of time.
And I wanted the world to know what was happening up there.
And the message was very clear : Climate change is for real , and we need to do something about it.
This morning , the temperature of the English Channel was 18 degrees.
It ' s fucking freezing.
Some people think that swimming is a very solo sport , you just dive into the sea and off you go.
And I had to visualize the swim.
And so I literally swam across the North Pole hundreds and hundreds of times in my mind.
And on day four , we decided to just do a quick five minute test swim.
I have never in my life felt anything like that moment.
I swam as hard as I could for five minutes.
And they were swollen so much , I couldn ' t even close them.
I immediately got rushed onto the ship and into a hot shower.
And this dream which I had had ever since I was a young boy with my father , was just going out the window.
The next morning , I woke up and I was in such a state of depression , and all I could think about was Sir Ranulph Fiennes.
And after just three minutes in that water , he was able to get himself out.
And Ran decided to go into his tool shed and take out a saw and do it himself.
We carried on sailing through the ice packs towards the North Pole.
And I realize the reason why you ' re going to do this.
And I just , I got so much confidence from him saying that , because he knew me so well.
And I went down into my cabin and I put on my swimming costume.
I had never seen black water before.
And so I now want to show you a short video of what happened there on the ice.
It was absolutely magical.
We ' re finally at the North Pole . This is months and months and months of dreaming to get here , years of training and planning and preparation.
Lewis Pugh : Ten seconds to swim . Ten seconds to swim.
You did it! You did it man!
Thank you so much.
There are very , very few people who don ' t know now about what is happening in the Arctic.
You saw during that video all those flags.
All of us together , we ' re all on the same ship together.
Four or five children sitting behind a desk , and even in those poorest conditions , they all have a very , very good grasp of climate change.
But the most important thing we must do is , I think , we must all walk to the end of our lives and turn around , and ask ourselves a most fundamental question.
As the world ' s attention focuses on the perils of oil exploration , we present Richard Sears '  talk from early February 2010 . Sears , an expert in developing new energy resources , talks about our inevitable and necessary move away from oil . Toward .. . what ? 
For the next few minutes we ' re going to talk about energy , and it ' s going to be a bit of a varied talk.
You take about eight or so carbon atoms , about 20 hydrogen atoms , you put them together in exactly the right way and you get this marvelous liquid : very energy-dense and very easy to refine into a number of very useful products and fuels.
A bigger one for you to look at.
Now , that ' s just one story about oil , and we could end it there and say ,  " Well , oil ' s going to last forever because , well , there ' s just a lot of it. " 
So , that ' s one of the stories of oil ; there ' s just a lot of it.
There was one kind of peak oil in 1985 , when oil represented 50 percent of global energy supply.
So oil is playing a less significant role every year.
Well , a lot of natural gas and a little bit of nuclear , for starters.
Now , I ' m not pretending that energy use in total isn ' t increasing , it is -- that ' s another part of the story . Come talk to me about it , we ' ll fill in some of the details -- but there ' s a very important message here : This is 200 years of history , and for 200 years we ' ve been systematically decarbonizing our energy system.
And to tell the next part of the story -- and this is looking out say 2100 and beyond.
I picked it up outside of Marble Falls , Texas.
I picked this up at MIT . It ' s a little younger.
It ' s not different , it ' s the same stuff : calcium carbonate , calcium carbonate.
Now , millions of abalone every year make this shell.
It ' s thousands of times , maybe 3,000 times tougher than this.
All the same , what ' s different ? 
And I ' ll suggest that this coal is about as exciting as this chalk.
And so that is my story.
It ' s because , well , thousands of years ago , people invented ideas -- they had ideas , innovations , technology -- and the Stone Age ended , not because we ran out of stones.
design,health care,product design
It ' s fantastic , it ' s going to blow your mind.
Here ' s me and my dad a couple days after I was born.
So why is it that this year ' s new cars look pretty much exactly like last year ' s new cars ? 
So here ' s a problem : Four million babies around the world , mostly in developing countries , die every year before their first birthday , even before their first month of life.
This is what we want.
Keeping a baby warm for a week , that ' s not rocket science.
Let ' s figure out what people want.
So the idea here is , unlike the concept car , we want to marry something beautiful with something that actually works.
We want design to get out for people to see it.
So it turns out that design for inspiration doesn ' t really -- I guess what I would say is , for us , for what I want to do , it ' s either too slow or it just doesn ' t work , it ' s ineffective.
So when we were designing NeoNurture , we paid a lot of attention to the people who are going to use this thing -- for example , poor families , rural doctors , overloaded nurses , even repair technicians.
And I have to ask the question -- VC ' s always ask ,  " Sir , what is your business , and who is your customer ?  " 
Those decisions are made by the Ministry of Health or by foreign donors , and it just kind of shows up.
So it turns out that design for outcomes in one aspect really means thinking about design for manufacture and distribution.
Our other partner is East Meets West.
And they said ,  " Well let ' s work on newborn jaundice. " 
There ' s one way to treat jaundice , and that ' s what ' s called an exchange transfusion.
You ' ve got to shine blue light on the kid -- bright blue light on as much of the skin as you can cover.
And here ' s how it ' s supposed to be used.
So these dark blue squares show you where it ' s effective phototherapy.
We see other examples of problems like this.
She sees her baby naked , lying under some blue lights , looking kind of vulnerable.
Except , what we ' ve learned is that there ' s no such thing as a dumb user -- really is what we ' ve learned.
It ' s the use -- designed for actual use.
They ' re inexpensive , really rugged.
They want Buck Rogers , they don ' t want effective.
So we took all that information together.
So from the very beginning we started by talking to manufacturers.
When we think about actual use , you ' ll notice that Firefly has a single bassinet.
So the idea here is we say , you want to make it hard to use wrong.
Well that ' s why we have lights above and below the baby in Firefly.
I had a laptop in the Peace Corps , and the screen had all these dead pixels on it.
We actually got rid of all of that stuff.
I have to pay attention to manufacturing and distribution.
I have to accept that there are no dumb users , that there ' s only dumb products.
Are we designing for the world that ' s coming , whether we ' re ready or not ? 
http://www.ted.com/talks/marc_pachter_the_art_of_the_interview.html
Marc Pachter : The art of the interview
And so I ' m not going to talk about the painted portrait today.
And so I came up with the idea of the living self-portrait series.
One was that they be American.
For obvious reasons , it doesn ' t seem that old anymore to me.
But the second part of it -- and the older I get , the more convinced I am that that ' s true.
So , we can then go back in our lives , if we ' ve got an interviewer who gets that , and begin to reflect on how we got there.
There are the journalist interviews , which are the interrogation that is expected.
That ' s Frost-Nixon , where Frost seems to be as important as Nixon in that process.
By the way , this was always done in public.
I didn ' t know it coming into it.
And I thought it was worth a chance , he thought it was worth a chance , and so we got up on the stage , and we had an hour conversation about his life , and after that a woman rushed up to me , essentially did , and she said ,  " Where did you train as a doctor ?  " 
I didn ' t know what was going on , but I was so part of the process of getting that out.
It had nothing to do with their intellect , the quality of their intellect.
I ' m convinced of it.
And so he filled the room , and we had an extraordinary conversation.
But after the interview , I got a call , very gruff voice , from a woman.
And then she made me go up with the tape of it and prove that George Abbott actually could talk.
There ' s nothing that ever happens that justifies people taking good hours of the day to be with them.
Didn ' t matter. "  Whatever.
But it comes down , in the end , to how do you get through all the barriers we have.
This wasn ' t -- and some of you will remember Mike Wallace ' s old interviews -- tough , aggressive and so forth . They have their place.
There ' s an extraordinary woman named Clare Boothe Luce.
She was a congresswoman when there weren ' t very many congresswomen.
And , in fact , when we did the interview -- I did the living self-portrait with her -- there were three former directors of the CIA basically sitting at her feet , just enjoying her presence.
We were on the stage and then -- by the way , spectacular.
And she stonewalled me . It was unbelievable.
When we were alone , I was her audience.
But I hadn ' t asked that , and then she went off on a tear , and she said ,  " Oh , well , there was that one time that I was an actress.
Just withering in her contempt.
Again , a remarkable person.
And she was in horrible pain.
The usual sort of thing.
Now , there are other ways that you get somebody to open up , and this is just a brief reference.
Was yours unhappy ?  " 
And he looked at me , and then we heard the big sad story.
And I ' ll just give you two examples of this because of the time constraints.
And he said ,  " Well , of course , but actually , I know him better than anyone who ever met him , because I got to read all of his letters. " 
And here is this man who had given his whole life to uncovering Jefferson and connecting with him , and he said ,  " Well ... "  -- I ' m going to do a bad southern accent.
And he basically was saying that this was a man who lied more than he wished he had , because he saw the letters.
And he started to talk about that , and later on he invited me to his house , and I met his wife who was from Massachusetts , and he and she had exactly the relationship of Thomas Jefferson and John Adams.
Agnes de Mille is one of the great choreographers in our history.
She said ,  " Come to my apartment. " 
I had known that she had had a stroke , and that was some 10 years before.
She wasn ' t unhappy about this . She was resigned.
She agreed.
And we had a conversation , and then I asked her this unthinkable question.
And she began to talk about things that had happened to her body and her face , and how she could no longer count on her beauty , and her family then treated her like the ugly sister of the beautiful one for whom all the ballet lessons were given.
But she was thrilled to get that out as a real , real fact in her life.
Just be that way with your friends and particularly the older members of your family.

Because there is this asymmetry , which creates , basically , failing governance.
I used to work as the director of the World Bank office in Nairobi for East Africa.
You are meddling in the internal affairs of our partner countries.
Let me give you an example : a huge power project , 300 million dollars , to be built smack into one of the most vulnerable , and one of the most beautiful , areas of western Kenya.
And yet , we all rejected this project , none of the donors was willing to have their name connected with it , and it was the first project to be implemented.
They were the actors of this global market , which I mentioned in the beginning.
This was the reality which I saw , and not only one project like that : I saw , I would say , over the years I worked in Africa , I saw hundreds of projects like this.
I found out afterwards , after I left , under a big fight , the World Bank.
No wonder that most of the most important international operators in Germany , but also in France and the UK and Scandinavia , everywhere , systematically bribed.
And therefore , there was a indeed a prisoner ' s dilemma , which made it very difficult for an individual company , an individual exporting country to say ,  " We are not going to continue this deadly , disastrous habit of large companies to bribe. " 
Many of the German companies , for instance , believe that they are really producing a high-quality product at a good price , so they are very competitive.
They began to think of an escape route from this prisoner ' s dilemma , and we developed concepts of collective action , basically trying to bring various competitors together around the table , explaining to all of them how much it would be in their interests if they simultaneously would stop bribing , and to make a long story short , we managed to eventually get Germany to sign together with the other OECD countries and a few other exporters.
In the first session -- we had three sessions over the course of two years.
They even applaud it.
Cabinet ministers would admit this.
We had a broader , geographically much wider , constituency we were trying to defend.
And , again , civil societies breathing down the neck of the establishment.
Civil society is pushing , civil society is trying to get a solution to this problem , also in the U.K. , and also in Japan , which is not properly enforcing , and so on.
In Germany , we have a system where you are not allowed to bribe a civil servant , but you are allowed to bribe a deputy.
I believe that what we managed to achieve in fighting corruption , one can also achieve in other areas of failing governance.
And this is possible because civil society joined the companies and joined the government in the analysis of the problem , in the development of remedies , in the implementation of reforms , and then later , in the monitoring of reforms.
So , we must be aware that civil society has to shape up itself.
This is why we have set up the governance school and the Center for Civil Society here in Berlin , because we believe most of our educational and research institutions in Germany and continental Europe in general , do not focus enough , yet , on empowering civil society and training the leadership of civil society.
Africa,creativity,culture,entertainment,film,global issues,media,technology
And it ' s an African story.
Today we have Nollywood , the third-largest film industry in the world.
It has created thousands , if not tens of thousands of jobs.
The industry is 15 years old.
My father also lived most of his adult life in East Africa.
I think I uttered the first words , and my family bought their first home.
And I remember really this desire to talk about Africa as a place where we lived and people live and go about their lives , and have dreams like we all have.
And we really look how digital technology is changing , and how young , independent filmmakers can make movies at a fraction of the cost.
So we went to Lagos in October 2005.
And he had nine days to make it.
I would like to show you six minutes.
Man : Action.
We ' re not doing films for the elite and the people in their glass houses.
Here is that you make these films , it sells , you jump onto the location again to make another film , because if you don ' t make the next film , you ' re not going to feed.
I think it ' s the most viable vehicle right now to pass information across a dedicated cable.
PP : I keep trying to explain to people , it ' s not about the quality at the moment -- the quality is coming.
Lancelot Imasen : But our films , they are stories that our people can relate to themselves.
It ' s the blockbuster comedy.
But we can do something too.
Come on . Don ' t run away . Come back . Come back.
You see how he talks . You see how he lives.
Man : See you . Bye.
For a young man to really make it out here , you got to think of some negative things and all that , or some kind of vices.
Man : Let ' s go.
Roboger Animadu : In big countries , when they do the movies , they have all these things in place.
Woman : That ' s why I use enough masking tape.
But she ' s a professional . She knows what she’s doing.
RA : So now you ' re about to see how we do our own movies here , with or without any assistance from anybody.
So many themes in this story.
Werner Herzog , the German filmmaker said ,  " I need to make movies like you need oxygen. " 
A woman told me ,  " When I see a Nollywood film , I can relax , I really -- I can breathe better. " 
And this has unleashed tremendous energy.
I hope that the Nollywood phenomenon will go both ways.
Filmmakers , friends of mine , they look at Nollywood and they say ,  " Wow , they are doing what we really want to do , and make a buck and live with this job. " 
Try to imagine a world where the only goal is food and a shelter , but no stories.
No novels.
I would like you to hear their voices.
If you have an industry that puts a smile on people ' s face , that’s Nollywood.
But we ' re telling it our own way , our own Nigerian way , African way.
And I really hope that this will happen.
FS : Oh , yes . I think I mentioned briefly -- it ' s close to 2,000 films.
And we know that there are more.
There is a glut of film , the quality has to be raised , they need to go to the next level , but I’m optimistic.
They are bought in video shops.
It ' s a CD , it ' s a little bit more compressed image.
So there are 57 million VCRs in Nigeria that play , you know , VHS and these VCDs.
And I have to say , this really proves that storytelling , it ' s a commodity , it ' s a staple.
Before he was a legend , architect Frank Gehry takes a whistlestop tour of his early work , from his house in Venice Beach to the American Center in Paris , which was under construction when he gave this talk.
I ' m going to go right into the slides.
Let me go right into the slides.
Anyway , I did this house in Santa Monica , and it got a lot of notoriety.
On the left-hand side , I had the context of those little houses , and I tried to build a building that fit into that context.
I was concerned about making a place for the study of law.
And it all related to the clients and the students from the very first meeting saying they felt denied a place.
I tried to be inclusive , to include the buildings in the neighborhood , whether they were buildings I liked or not.
I couldn ' t deal with the success of furniture -- I wasn ' t secure enough as an architect -- and so I closed it all up and made furniture that nobody would like.
The piece on the left -- and that ultimately led to the piece on the right -- happened when the kid that was working on this took one of those long strings of stuff and folded it up to put it in the wastebasket.
I mean , the story I tell is that I got mad at postmodernism -- at po-mo -- and said that fish were 500 million years earlier than man , and if you ' re going to go back , we might as well go back to the beginning.
And a lot of my architectural ideas that came from it -- accidental , again -- it was an intuitive kind of thing , and I just kept going with it , and made this proposal for a building , which was only a proposal.
And after I got -- I was really drunk -- I was asked to do some sketches on napkins.
Three weeks later , I received a complete set of drawings saying we ' d won the competition.
I started to get the head OK , but the tail I couldn ' t do.
It was a dialog with the context again.
So ...
We made the drawings of the fish and the scales.
And it ' s one of the nicest pieces I ' ve ever made , I think.
And so we built a temporary building -- I ' m getting good at temporary -- and we put a conference room in that ' s a fish.
When I went to sleep , the next day it wasn ' t there.
I went around Toronto and found a bathtub like my grandmother ' s , and I put the fish in.
And we ' ve started to work on things.
He was a souvenir salesman who always wanted to be a painter , and I was Frankie P . Toronto.
This beautiful object , the Swiss Army knife , which I get credit for participating in.
We made it into a sailing craft.
And I ' m fascinated with that , which , like the paper furniture -- it ' s one of those materials.
And that chain link is really expensive.
Of course , the milk can is his.
Then Jay Chiat asked me to do this building on this funny lot in Venice , and I started with this three-piece thing , and you entered in the middle.
I had the binoculars from Claes , and I put them there , and I could never get rid of them after that.
It led to the building on the left.
I said ,  " If I can ' t get the craft that I want , I ' ll use the craft I can get. " 
The metalworkers , for the most part , do ducts behind the ceilings and stuff.
It ' s a way of connecting , at least , with some of those people that are so important to the realization of architecture.
I mean , it ' s kind of a trite thing to say , but it is real that they wanted to have a central place where the cafeteria would be , where the people would come and where the people working would interact.
I spent a lot of time undoing Richard Meier ' s aesthetic.
There ' s a ramp.
Because these were ideas that we were talking about , building things next to each other , making -- it ' s all about [a] metaphor for a city , maybe.
He ' d made a building with a dome and he had a little tower.
And so I decided to put him in a depression.
And so then I put this big billboard behind it.
It was a very prominent building off the freeway , and we added a floor and cleaned it up and fixed it up and used the kind of -- I thought -- the language of the neighborhood , which had these cornices , projecting cornices.
And it surprised both Boston and myself that we got it approved , because they have very strict kind of design guideline , and they wouldn ' t normally think I would fit them.
But they made it a third smaller than my model without telling me.
And the shape fit perfectly.
It gave me an opportunity to make a sculpture out of it.
And we started with the stream and built the house along the stream -- dammed it up to make a lake.
When you have to do something really cheaply , it ' s hard to get perfect corners and stuff.
I thought it was fitting for me to be doing that.
He didn ' t recommend me , by the way.
You ' ve got the idea.
And the building is very sculptural as you walk around it.
In this case we learned how to detail it.
And we had the opportunity to build a building on this site.
Burnham had designed a railroad station that was never built , and so we followed.
The health club is fastened to the garage with a C-clamp , for Cleveland.
This owner has a pet peeve about bad automobile entries.
I feel much more comfortable down here.
And following that basic idea of the village , we changed it as we got into it.
She wanted a dome somewhere in the house.
But when you ' re in that room , you feel like you ' re on a kind of barge on some kind of lake.
These aren ' t focused very well.
Left -- it ' s my right.
A guest bedroom , which has this dome with marble on it.
And the bed is back in this space , with windows looking out onto the lake.
And this happened by accident that I got this right on axis with the dining room table.
And you feel like you ' re in your own kind of village.
You go under this bridge at about 65 miles an hour , and there ' s another bridge here.
Kind of a fun thing to do.
So we ' ve made a kind of pragmatic slab in the second phase here , and we ' ve taken the conference facilities and made a villa out of them so that the communal space is very sculptural and separate.
The Minister of Finance -- the guy that moved from the Louvre -- goes in here.
And the French have this extraordinary way of screwing things up by taking a beautiful site and cutting the corner off.
I showed you the other model , the one -- this is the way I organized myself so I could make the drawing -- so I understood the problem.
And the one on the left is pretty awful.
The restaurants here -- the apartments and the theater , etc.
On the side facing the street it ' s much more normal , except I slipped a few mansards down , so that coming on the point , these housing units made a gesture to the corner.
Jay Chiat is a glutton for punishment , and he hired me to do a house for him in the Hamptons.
I say ,  " I ' m not going to do it anymore -- I don ' t want to do it anymore -- I ' m not going to do it. " 
And this piece here is -- I don ' t know what it is.
I think I ' m from Mars for them , and they are for me , but somehow we all manage to work together , and I think , productively.
And then this is a kind of a shopping mall , with a rodeo and restaurants.
The light grid will have a light , be lit up at night and give a kind of light ceiling.
And as you pass by it ' s always part -- you see it as all of these pieces accrue and become part of an overall neighborhood.
I ' m so cunning and clever -- I made it quiet and wonderful.
I know I ' m over time.
It ' s a complicated project.
And the plan of this -- it ' s a concert hall.
But finally , there ' s a hotel there.
You have to then try and get that back in some way.
Everybody liked the surround.
We finally settled on a shape that was the proportion of the Concertgebouw with the sloping outside walls , which the acoustician said were crucial to this and later decided they weren ' t , but now we have them.
And the nice thing about introducing columns is they give you a kind of sense of proscenium from wherever you sit , and create intimacy.
Most halls come straight down into a proscenium.
When you get into a box , it ' s harder to do it -- and here we are , struggling with how to put the hotel in.
And of course it ' s not going to look like that , but it is the crazy way I tend to work.
It ' s a public space , and I made it kind of a garden structure , and you can go in it.
And so we took the language of this exposed steel and used it , perverted it , into the form of the fish , and created a kind of a 19th-century contraption that looks like , that will sit -- this is the beach and the harbor out in front , and this is really a shopping center with department stores.
We showed this to the hotel people the other day , and they were terrified and said that nobody would come to the Ritz-Carlton anymore , because of this fish.
Time goes on.
It should have been the other way around -- the food should have been good first.

Amy Smith shares simple , lifesaving design
It addresses one of the biggest health issues on the planet , the number one cause of death in children under five , which is .. .  ?  Water-borne diseases ?  Diarrhea ?  Malnutrition ? 
Can ' t we make better stoves ? 
You ' ll see scenes like this all over the island.
Now one of the reasons why there are so few trees is this : people need to cook , and they harvest wood and they make charcoal in order to do it.
And so this is what they do.
This is one such volunteer , and this is a device that he had built in the village where he worked.
So you could imagine they were very excited about it.
And in fact if you look closely , right here , you can see it says ,  " U.S . Peace Corps. " 
What we wanted to do is we wanted to make a fuel that used something that was readily available on the local level.
It just sits in a pile near the sugar mill until eventually they burn it.
After some time , after setting it on fire , you seal it to restrict the oxygen that goes into the kiln , and then you end up with this carbonized material here.
And so what we did was we looked , and we found that cassava is indeed grown in Haiti , under the name of  " manioc. " 
These are the graduates of the first Ecole de Chabon , or Charcoal Institute . And these -- -- that ' s right . So I ' m actually an instructor at MIT as well as CIT.
Kids and women are especially affected by it , because they ' re the ones who are around the cooking fires.
And there was wheat straw and there was rice straw in this area.
And in fact , it heats the water a lot more quickly.
So we went back to MIT , we took out the Instron machine , and we figured out what sort of forces did you need in order to compress a briquette to the level that you actually are getting improved performance out of it ? 
In Haiti alone , about 30 million trees are cut down every year.
So this is where we ' re also moving ahead with our charcoal project.
But now we have a way that ' s using an agricultural waste material to create a cooking fuel.
And the beauty of this is that you don ' t need to form briquettes -- it comes ready made . This is my $100 laptop , right here.
And I think one of the things , which is also remarkable about this technology , is that the technology transfer is so easy.
So not only do you have health benefits , you have environmental benefits.
They can save the money that they were going to spend on charcoal , and they can produce excess and sell it in the market to people who aren ' t making their own.
And now I don ' t actually mean the world that we live in.
That ' s as if the entire workforce of the State of California worked full time for a year doing nothing but fetching water.
And more than half of you would be living on less than a dollar a day.
I have a few areas that I believe are especially important that we address.
And we need to rethink our development strategies , so that we ' re not promoting educational campaigns to get them to stop being farmers , but rather to stop being poor farmers.
So we need to create this future , and we need to start doing it now.
One of the really exciting things is looking at solar water disinfection and improving the ability to be able to do that.
It ' s a difficult thing ; it ' s a marketplace which is very fragmented and a consumer population with no income.
We have 30 students a year go out into the field and try to implement this and move it forward.
Facial surgeon Iain Hutchison works with people whose faces have been severely disfigured . By pushing to improve surgical techniques , he helps to improve their lives ; and by commissioning their portraits , he celebrates their humanity . NOTE : This talk contains images of disfigured and badly injured faces that may be disturbing -- and Hutchison provides thoughtful answers as to why a disfigured face can shock us so deeply . Squeamish ?  Hide your screen from 12:10 - 13:19 , but do keep listening . Portraits shown in this talk come from Mark Gilbert.
Our face is hugely important because it ' s the external , visual part that everybody else sees.
And this bone is peppered , as you can see , with the light shining through the skull with cavities , the sinuses , which warm and moisten the air we breathe.
And overlying this is the skin drape , which is a hugely complex three-dimensional structure -- taking right-angled bends here and there , having thin areas like the eyelids , thick areas like the cheek , different colors.
It ' s the face where we ' re attracted to with that.
There ' s a definite difference.
Dysmorphophobia is a perversion of this where people who may be very good looking regard themselves as hideously ugly and are constantly seeking surgery to correct their facial appearance.
In other words , he looks entirely normal.
As you can see , it ' s blocking her vision.
Actually , sometimes the parents argue about whether these children should have the lesion removed.
Shouldn ' t you be doing something about this ?  Why haven ' t you had it removed ?  " 
The adults behave more naturally , and the children play more readily with other children.
So our facial appearance is vital to us as we ' re trying to project ourselves to the world.
I ' ve chosen to show this profile view of Sue because what it shows is her lower jaw jutting forward and her lower lip jutting forward.
She wasn ' t miserable at all.
So she chose to have facial surgery.
Is this change , though , a real change , or is it a figment of the imagination of the patient themselves ? 
They were all perceived as being less than normal in all those characteristics -- more violent , etc . -- before the surgery.
What happens to them is that they may have suffered cancer or trauma.
I learned a huge amount from Henry.
He maintained a calm insouciance.
And that ' s what these people can do.
It took 23 hours . I did it with my neurosurgeon.
And again , he said ,  " This painting of me with my son Jeremiah shows me as the successful man that I feel that I am. " 
For instance , there are two different types of facial surgery.
They don ' t feel different.
If you do cosmetic surgery , patients are often less happy.
But then we have other people who don ' t choose to have facial surgery.
And again , as I told you , if they have a caring family and good work life , then they can lead normal and fulfilled lives.
This is a little Bangladeshi girl from the east end of London who ' s got a huge malignant tumor on the right side of her face , which has already made her blind and which is rapidly growing and is going to kill her shortly.
It ' s been going on since we can think of Lombroso and the way he would define criminal faces.
We ' d like to spend time with him . He looks friendly.
We think we can judge people on their expressions.
Are we uncomfortable with this image ?  Yes , we are.
The truth is that there ' s a five-minute rule , not the tenth-of-a-second rule like Todorov , but a five-minute rule.
This is an image of Ann who ' s had her right jaw removed and the base of her skull removed.
And that ' s what she achieved , and that ' s what we have to get to.
This is the bar that he set for us.
We then bent a plate up to it.
So the patient ' s life is restored.
It ' s thicker , it ' s darker , it ' s coarser , it doesn ' t have the contours.
So it ' s very valuable to have that tool in our armamentarium.
This is not a life-saving transplant -- like a heart , or liver , or lung transplant -- it is a quality-of-life transplant , and as a result , are the patients going to say , if they get a malignant cancer 10 or 15 years on ,  " I wish I ' d had conventional reconstructive techniques rather than this because I ' m now dying of a malignant cancer "  ?  We don ' t know yet.
So there are going to be problems with face transplantation.
I can sprinkle a few cells , stem cells from the patient ' s own hip , a little bit of genetically engineered protein , and lo and behold , leave it for four months and the face is grown.
We ' re still not curing enough patients -- it ' s the most disfiguring cancer.
We need to do research.
Thank you very much indeed.

I ' m doing 7,100 meals a day and I ' ve been doing it for two years , trying to change how we feed kids in America.
Everyone says it couldn ' t be done.
And I ' ll tell you why we need to change it , but we absolutely have to change it.
We ' re seeing sick kids get sicker and sicker.
The way we got here is because of big agribusiness.
So when I started thinking about these issues and how I was going to change what kids ate , I really started focusing on what we would teach them.
And then we talk about organic food.
You know , it doesn ' t work.
We are feeding our kids antibiotics in beef and other animal protein every day.
And , you know , certainly antibiotics have been over-prescribed , but it ' s an issue in the food supply.
Okay , we could talk about Rachel Carson and DDT , but we know it wasn ' t good for you and me.
We cannot believe that they have our best interests at heart.
It ' s consuming food in a way in which we ' ll still have a planet , in which kids will grow up to be healthy , and which really tries to mitigate all the negative impacts we ' re seeing.
We now live in a country that has more prisoners than farmers -- 2.1 million prisoners , 1.9 million farmers.
We ' re getting sick and our kids are getting sick.
And if we continue down this path , if we continue to feed kids bad food , if we continue not to teach them what good food is , what ' s going to happen ?  You know , what is going to happen ? 
And if that ' s not enough , they ' ve gone on to say , most before they graduate high school.
And it ' s because of what we feed them.
Big companies spend 20 billion dollars a year marketing non-nutrient foods to kids.
You know that everybody thinks they should be eating more , and more , and more.
Why can we have 29-cent Big Gulps and 99-cent double burgers ? 
Well , this is the food I found 24 months ago.
The only kitchen tools my staff had was a box cutter.
In case you can ' t tell , that ' s , like , pink Danish and some kind of cupcakes.
And we , all of us , have to understand that this is about us , that we can make a difference here.
And that they could figure it out , that we could sell this stuff to kids.
We really need to change this whole paradigm with kids and food.
You know , we have to change the way we teach kids about these things.
We ' re cooking from scratch every day.
We can ' t keep serving kids processed crap , full of chemicals , and expect these are going to be healthy citizens.
You know what ?  They ' re just going to be sick.
Now I ' m in charge of all the cooking classes and all the gardening classes in our school district.
Those are the recipes that the kids learn in my cooking classes.
Now you ' ve probably garnered that I don ' t love the USDA , and I don ' t have any idea what to do with their pyramid , this upside-down pyramid with a rainbow over the top , I don ' t know.
We have to start changing this.
What are kids learning ?  Where is the family time ? 
I work with kids a lot . These are kids I work with in Harlem.
And we have to pull it all together . We have composting in all of our schools.
Because , you know what , many of us are sort of at the end of our careers , and we need to be giving these kids -- these young kids , the next generation -- the tools to save themselves and save the planet.
Most schools in America spend less than 7,500 dollars a year teaching a child.
And if we ' re going to change it , and change how we feed kids , we really have to rethink that.
It ' s going to take more money.
You know , if you have kids coming into lunch and all they ' re going to do when they get out of lunch is go to have recess , you see them just throw away their lunch so they can run outside.
We need to -- we need to educate.
Two were supposed to be cooks -- none could.
We need 40-minute lunches -- most schools have 20-minute lunches -- and lunches that are time-appropriate.
And just remember , at very least tacitly , this is what we ' re teaching children as what they should be doing.
Okay , Finance 101 on this , and this -- I ' m sort of wrapping it up with this finance piece , because I think this is something we all have to understand.
In this country , we ' re spending 110 billion dollars a year on fast food.
200 billion.
That means we spend less than a dollar a day on food for kids in schools -- most schools , 80 to 90 cents . In L.A. , it ' s 56 cents.
You know what ?  We should be ashamed.
It ' s the kids who have parents and grandparents and uncles and aunts that can ' t even afford to pay for school lunch that gets this food.
That every single one of us , whether we have children , whether we care about children , whether we have nieces or nephews , or anything -- that we can make a difference.
http://www.ted.com/talks/jonas_eliasson_how_to_solve_traffic_jams.html
Jonas Eliasson : How to solve traffic jams
I mean , think about how different cities are , actually.
Anyway , the American cities : lots of roads dispersed over large areas , almost no public transportation.
They ' re basically attempts at figuring out what people should do instead of rush hour car driving.
And the urban planner in London goes ,  " What do you mean , who ' s in charge of London ' s — I mean , no one is in charge. " 
I mean , it basically -- I haven ' t really thought of it.
When you try to solve really complex social problems , the right thing to do is most of the time to create the incentives.
Now , Stockholm is a medium-sized city , roughly two million people , but Stockholm also has lots of water and lots of water means lots of bridges -- narrow bridges , old bridges -- which means lots of road congestion.
You would be wrong.
Now , that ' s also wrong , because traffic happens to be a nonlinear phenomenon , meaning that once you reach above a certain capacity threshold then congestion starts to increase really , really rapidly.
The first day with the congestion charges looked like this.
So after a while they would all come back because they have sort of gotten used to charges.
I mean , this was a really fun experiment to start with , and we actually got to do it twice.
This is the last day with the congestion charges , July 31 , and you see the same street but now it ' s summer , and summer in Stockholm is a very nice and light time of the year , and the first day without the congestion charges looked like this.
Now these traffic figures are really exciting and a little bit surprising and very useful to know , but I would say that the most surprising slide here I ' m going to show you today is not this one . It ' s this one.
No , on the contrary , they changed , up to a point where we now have 70 percent support for keeping the charges , meaning that -- I mean , let me repeat that : 70 percent of the population in Stockholm want to keep a price for something that used to be free.
And where did they go ?  If we can understand this , then maybe we can figure out how people can be so happy with this.
And why is that ?  It ' s because that travel patterns are much less stable than you might think.
Who changed their opinion , and why ? 
Which means that we are now in a position where we have reduced traffic across this toll cordon with 20 percent , and reduced congestion by enormous numbers , and people aren ' t even aware that they have changed , and they honestly believe that they have liked this all along.
http://www.ted.com/talks/monika_bulaj_the_hidden_light_of_afghanistan.html
Monika Bulaj : The hidden light of Afghanistan
Behind the destruction , I found a soul of places.
And I ever met more humble people.
I was alone on foot.
So I have been walking and traveling , by horses , by yak , by truck , by hitchhiking , from Iran ' s border to the bottom , to the edge of the Wakhan Corridor.
Hidden river , interconnected with the mysticism from Gibraltar to India.
These are the nomad girls who became prostitutes for Afghan businessmen.
13,000 girls studying here in the rooms underground , full of scorpions.
My aim is to give a voice to the silent people , to show the hidden lights behind the curtain of the great game , the small worlds ignored by the media and the prophets of a global conflict.
1181
I ' m going to define what the terms of my success are. " 
Regarding the word  " patient, "  when I first started a few years ago getting involved in health care and attending meetings as just a casual observer , I noticed that people would talk about patients as if it was somebody who ' s not in the room here , somebody out there.
So when you hear what I ' m going to talk about here today , first of all , I want to say that I am here on behalf of all the patients that I have ever met , all the ones I haven ' t met.
Now I ' m going to step back in history.
The world was changing.
Here , just for historical authenticity , is a picture of me in that year.
We think of hippies of being just hedonists , but there ' s a very strong component -- I was in that movement -- a very strong component of being responsible for yourself.
And he saw that the great majority of what we do in medicine and health care is taking care of ourselves.
And he coined this term e-Patients -- equipped , engaged , empowered , enabled.
Well , I got an X-ray , and the next morning -- you may have noticed , those of you who have been through a medical crisis will understand this.
The phone rang and it was my doctor.
To make a long story short , I said ,  " So you need me to get back in there ?  " 
This is the advice your doctor gives you :  " just go home and have a glass of wine with your wife. " 
That meant it was metastasized from somewhere.
My wife came with me.
This is much sharper than an ultrasound would be.
One was growing out the back , and it attached to the soleus muscle , which is a big muscle in the back that I ' d never heard of , but all of a sudden I cared about it.
My point is I went to a respected medical website , WebMD , because I know how to filter out junk.
There ' s so much about trust -- what sources of information can we trust ? 
Where does medical ability end and start ? 
And what I found was on other websites , even by the third page of Google results ,  " Outlook is bleak "  ,  " Prognosis is grim. " 
I was slowly losing weight , but for me , that was what the doctor told me to do.
In the left femur , the left thigh bone , there ' s another one.
I had kidney cancer growing out of my tongue.
I thought ,  " What ' s my mother ' s face going to look like on the day of my funeral ?  " 
It ' s really serious.
Get yourself to a specialist center.
And by the way , here are four doctors in your part of the United States who offer it and their phone numbers. " 
Government-approved , American Cancer Society , but patients know what patients want to know.
And he said ,  " You know , the immune system is good at detecting invaders -- bacteria coming from outside -- but when it ' s your own tissue that you ' ve grown , it ' s a whole different thing. " 
And the story of how all that happens is in this book.
You see , that ' s the immune system.
Who knows what we ' ll be able to do when we learn to make more use of it.
Now I want to talk briefly about a couple of other patients who are doing everything in their power to improve health care.
And she thought ,  " You know , if I have a nutrition facts label on the side of a cereal box , why can ' t there be something that simple telling every new nurse who comes on duty , every new doctor , the basics about my husband ' s condition ?  " 
She came to realize that there were a lot of people who ' d written patient advocate books that you just don ' t hear about at medical conferences.
And here she has our damned data -- it ' s a pun -- which is starting to break out , starting to break through -- the water symbolizes our data.
♫ Gimme my damn data ♫ ♫ I want to be an e-Patient just like Dave ♫ ♫ Gimme my damn data , cuz it ' s my life to save ♫ Now I ' m not going to go any further.
And I thought ,  " You know , I wonder what my soleus muscle is ?  " 
And then I realized it reminded me of Google Earth , where you can fly to any address.
But you see , it ' s still generic.
This is a live story unfolding just in the last few weeks.
Well she found , through her online research , a nuclear bone scan that ' s usually used for cancer , but it can also reveal inflammation.
Well that ' s not what he was supposed to do with it.
So she pulled up the CD of the scan images , and look at all those hot spots.
What she was able to do was because she had access to the raw data.
Raw data now. " 
For all the patients around the world watching this on the webcast , God bless you , everyone -- let patients help.
Africa,activism,business,development,economics,global issues,politics,poverty
Well , the thesis of  " The Bottom Billion "  is that a billion people have been stuck living in economies that have been stagnant for 40 years , and hence diverging from the rest of mankind.
What I ' m going to offer you is a recipe , a combination of the two forces that changed the world for good , which is the alliance of compassion and enlightened self-interest.
We need compassion to get ourselves started , and enlightened self-interest to get ourselves serious.
Well , a good guide is to think ,  " What did we do last time the rich world got serious about developing another region of the world ?  " 
That was post-War Europe.
Europe had to be dragged into economic development.
But what else did you do ? 
So , total reversal of trade policy.
After the war , you tear that up , you put 100,000 troops in Europe for over 40 years.
After the war , you found the United Nations , you found the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development , you found the IMF , you encouraged Europe to create the European Community -- all systems for mutual government support.
Is that easier or harder ? 
The opportunity we ' re going to look to is a genuine basis for optimism about the bottom billion , and that is the commodity booms.
So , a mass of new discoveries.
So , the flow of resources from the commodity booms to the bottom billion are without precedent.
Will it be taken ? 
And the short run -- say , the first five to seven years -- is just great.
And how about the long run ? 
That is not a forecast about how commodity prices go ; it ' s a forecast of the consequences , the long-term consequences , for growth of an increase in prices.
You go up in the short term , and then you go up even more in the long term.
That ' s what we ' re seeing across the bottom billion at the moment.
It ' s countries like Nigeria , which are worse off than if they ' d never had oil.
Now , there ' s one big change since the commodity booms of the 1970s , and that is the spread of democracy.
Democracies make even more of a mess of these resource booms than autocracies.
And so , what the countries of the bottom billion need is very strong checks and balances.
In all the societies of the bottom billion , there are intense struggles to do just that.
That is the very simple idea that governments should report to their citizens what revenues they have.
So , we know it works . What would the content be of these international standards ? 
You know how rights to resource extraction are being sold at the moment , how they ' ve been sold over the last 40 years ? 
The public agency with the greatest expertise on Earth is of course the treasury -- that is , the British Treasury.
It went for 20 billion pounds through auction.
If we could do it , we would change the world.
If you think about it , the cost of promulgating international rules is zilch -- nothing.
And so I realized we had to go through the business of building an informed citizenry.
I grew up in a culture of self-effacement.
http://www.ted.com/talks/steven_schwaitzberg_a_universal_translator_for_surgeons.html
Steven Schwaitzberg : A universal translator for surgeons
And in my little corner of the world , these two things are actually related , and I want to tell you how tonight.
Keep your hands up if you wanted an operation.
That ' s what I want to talk to you about tonight -- how doing and teaching this type of surgery led us on a search for a better universal translator.
We perform a million of these a year in the United States alone.
It ' s hard to teach , and it ' s not all that easy to learn.
Surgeons are not made either.
We build on that and we take people , hopefully , to the operating room where they learn to be an assistant.
You get your board certificate , and you can go out into practice.
It ' s not a lecture , it ' s not a course , it ' s all of that plus a high-stakes assessment.
No , we just said all surgeons.
We can ' t travel everywhere.
So I was inspired by a friend.
Very inspiring.
Let me bring it to you locally.
It ' s a big labor-intensive effort.
And you have no idea how hard it is to talk to somebody or take care of somebody you can ' t talk to.
One of the things that I want to leave you with as you think about this talk is that this talk is not just about us preaching to the world.
Maybe we have something to learn as well.
So here ' s what we think we want to do : Imagine giving a lecture and being able to talk to people in their own native language simultaneously.
It ' s a big task.
A lexicon is a body of words that describes a domain.
So let me show you what we ' re doing.
But we don ' t have the words yet , so we add a third technology.
And we currently have access to eleven language pairs.
Module five : manual skills practice.
But that ' s the lectures.
Allan Okrainec : Today we ' re going to practice suturing.
Aim for the black dots.
SS : So that ' s what we ' re working on in our quest for the universal translator.
As we think about intersecting technologies -- everybody has a cell phone with a camera -- we could use this everywhere , whether it be health care , patient care , engineering , law , conferencing , translating videos.
http://www.ted.com/talks/janet_echelman.html
Janet Echelman : Taking imagination seriously
I was an unlikely person to be doing this.
Promising to give exhibitions of paintings , I shipped my paints and arrived in Mahabalipuram.
So I tried bronze casting.
My first satisfying sculpture was made in collaboration with these fishermen.
I was mesmerized.
Thousands of people saw it , and one of them was the urbanist Manual Sola-Morales who was redesigning the waterfront in Porto , Portugal.
For two years , I searched for a fiber that could survive ultraviolet rays , salt , air , pollution , and at the same time remain soft enough to move fluidly in the wind.
But there was no engineering software to model something porous and moving.
So I developed a relationship with an industrial fishnet factory , learned the variables of their machines , and figured out a way to make lace with them.
It was hard to believe that what I had imagined was now built , permanent and had lost nothing in translation.
As I watched the wind ' s choreography unfold , I felt sheltered and , at the same time , connected to limitless sky.
Historic Philadelphia City Hall : its plaza , I felt , needed a material for sculpture that was lighter than netting.
I didn ' t know where to begin , but I said yes.
Its title :  " 1.26 "  refers to the number of microseconds that the Earth ' s day was shortened.
The sculpture could now be entirely soft , which made it so light it could tie in to existing buildings -- literally becoming part of the fabric of the city.
This new soft structural method enables me to model these and build these sculptures at the scale of skyscrapers.
My artistic horizons continue to grow.
There they were in their business suits , laying in the grass , noticing the changing patterns of wind beside people they didn ' t know , sharing the rediscovery of wonder.
In stunning large-format photographs , Edward Burtynsky follows the path of oil through modern society , from wellhead to pipeline to car engine -- and then beyond to the projected peak-oil endgame.
I started my journey 30 years ago.
And after 17 years of photographing large industrial landscapes , it occurred to me that oil is underpinning the scale and speed.
The other chapter that I wanted to look at was how we use it -- our cities , our cars , our motorcultures , where people gather around the vehicle as a celebration.
It was 23 metric tons for one liter.
And that also brought me to the fact that this poses such a risk to our society.
So , it ' s not a question of if , but a question of when peak oil will come upon us.
Neuroscientist and inventor Christopher deCharms demonstrates a new way to use fMRI to show brain activity -- thoughts , emotions , pain -- while it is happening . In other words , you can actually see how you feel.
Hi . I ' m going to ask you to raise your arms and wave back , just the way I am -- kind of a royal wave.
I ' m going to tell you about that technology.
You had to take a spaceship , shrink it down , inject it into the bloodstream.
We ' re going to fly into my colleague Peter ' s brain.
When Peter moves his arm , that yellow spot you see there is the interface to the functioning of Peter ' s mind taking place.
He can look at these 65,000 points of activation per second.
We all know that as we form thoughts , they form deep channels in our minds and in our brains.
So put your arms back up and flex your bicep.
They ' re watching their own brain activation , and they ' re controlling the pathway that produces their pain.
This is an investigational technology , but , in clinical trials , we ' re seeing a 44 to 64 percent decrease in chronic pain patients.
You will be able to look at all the aspects that make you yourself , all your experiences.
Where will we take it ? 
801
It ' s thought that science can help us get what we value , but it can never tell us what we ought to value.
So , I ' m going to argue that this is an illusion -- that the separation between science and human values is an illusion -- and actually quite a dangerous one at this point in human history.
Values are a certain kind of fact.
It ' s because we don ' t think rocks can suffer . And if we ' re more concerned about our fellow primates than we are about insects , as indeed we are , it ' s because we think they ' re exposed to a greater range of potential happiness and suffering.
And to say that such changes can persist after death is itself a factual claim , which , of course , may or may not be true.
And we know -- we know -- that there are right and wrong answers to how to move in this space.
There are truths to be known about how human communities flourish , whether or not we understand these truths.
But if we ' re going to talk about human well-being we are , of necessity , talking about the human brain.
And so therefore whatever cultural variation there is in how human beings flourish can , at least in principle , be understood in the context of a maturing science of the mind -- neuroscience , psychology , etc.
And one thing to notice is that perhaps there are states of human well-being that we rarely access , that few people access.
Now , let me be clear about what I ' m not saying . I ' m not saying that science is guaranteed to map this space , or that we will have scientific answers to every conceivable moral question.
For instance , there are 21 states in our country where corporal punishment in the classroom is legal , where it is legal for a teacher to beat a child with a wooden board , hard , and raising large bruises and blisters and even breaking the skin.
And the rationale for this behavior is explicitly religious.
Now , many of you might worry that the notion of well-being is truly undefined , and seemingly perpetually open to be re-construed.
As we just heard from Michael Specter , it has changed over the years.
People will send you donations when you ' re in that condition.
Now , why wouldn ' t this undermine an objective morality ? 
The fact that there are many right answers to the question ,  " What is food ?  " 
Why would we think this ? 
There are moments when losing your Queen is a brilliant thing to do.
Now , this brings us to the sorts of moves that people are apt to make in the moral sphere.
And who are we to say , even , that they ' re wrong to beat them with lengths of steel cable , or throw battery acid in their faces if they decline the privilege of being smothered in this way ? 
But what does voluntary mean in a community where , when a girl gets raped , her father ' s first impulse , rather often , is to murder her out of shame ? 
For instance , this is what it ' s like to go to a newsstand almost anywhere in the civilized world.
Probably not . OK , so perhaps there ' s some place on the spectrum between these two extremes that represents a place of better balance.
And of course they think they have right answers to moral questions because they got these answers from a voice in a whirlwind , not because they made an intelligent analysis of the causes and condition of human and animal well-being.
Now , what stands in the way of this ? 
On the other hand , we have someone like Ted Bundy ; Ted Bundy was very fond of abducting and raping and torturing and killing young women.
There ' s nothing that one should be able to say to the other that should persuade the other. " 
If you ask the smartest physicists around who is the smartest physicist around , in my experience half of them will say Ed Witten.
I ' m not a fan. " 
But this is just the point.
How have we convinced ourselves that in the moral sphere there is no such thing as moral expertise , or moral talent , or moral genius even ? 
How is their ignorance any less obvious on the subject of human well-being ? 
Just admitting this will transform our discourse about morality.
We simply must converge on the answers we give to the most important questions in human life.
Language seems to be really important here.
I mean , can you engage in a conversation with that kind of woman without seeming kind of cultural imperialist ? 
CA : A lot of people want to believe in this concept of moral progress.
SH : Well , I think once you admit that we are on the path toward understanding our minds at the level of the brain in some important detail , then you have to admit that we are going to understand all of the positive and negative qualities of ourselves in much greater detail.
I mean I don ' t think we need an NSF grant to know that compulsory veiling is a bad idea -- but at a certain point we ' re going to be able to scan the brains of everyone involved and actually interrogate them.
SH : Well yeah , modulo one obvious fact , that you can love someone in the context of a truly delusional belief system.
It ' s all of us in this together , not one man feeling ecstasy and then blowing himself up on a bus.
http://www.ted.com/talks/shimon_steinberg_natural_pest_control_using_bugs.html
Shimon Steinberg : Natural pest control .. . using bugs!
And then I thought , myself , how can I be practical or help in the science of entomology ? 
And biological pest control , by the way , or these good bugs that we are talking about , they ' ve existed in the world for thousands and thousands of years , for a long , long time.
That ' s a magnifier times 10.
So this phenomenon of natural control exists literally everywhere.
Well let us go hand by hand and browse through just a few examples.
In general , I ' m going to talk about insects and spiders , or mites , let us call them.
You see the mother in between and two daughters , probably on the left and right , and a single egg on the right-hand side.
But here comes nature that provides us with a good spider.
By the way , a meal for them for 24 hours is about five individuals of the spider mites , of the bad mites , or 15 to 20 eggs of the pest mites.
When temperature rises sharply , you can see those bad ones , those aphids , all over the plants , in your hibiscus , in your lantana , in the young , fresh foliage of the spring flush , so-called.
Parthenogenesis , [as it] was so called.
Here you see a typical cucumber leaf that turned actually from green to black because of a black fungus , sooty mold , which is covering it.
This is a parasitic wasp , again , two millimeters long , slender , a very quick and sharp flier.
She kicks and bites and secretes different liquids , but nothing will happen , in fact.
This is not fiction , nothing at all.
This is the visual result of a dead aphid encompassing inside , in fact , a developing parasitoid that after a few minutes you see halfway out.
This female can live only three to four days , and she needs to give rise to around 400 eggs.
Again , we ' ll start first with the pest : the thrips.
This is not just an exotic , ornamental sweet pepper.
And again , in action.
So this is a very positive situation , by the way.
What we do is actually this.
Many different parts.
We take them from nature , and the only thing that we do , we give them the optimal conditions , under the greenhouses or in the climate rooms , in order to proliferate , multiply and reproduce.
And this is the whole bunch of predatory mites.
And we can produce from this , believe you me , several dozens of kilograms on an annual basis.
Here we come with those natural enemies in order to reverse a little bit of the wheel and to bring more natural balance to the agricultural plot by reducing those chemicals.
For example , in Israel , where we employ more than 1,000 hectares -- 10,000 dunams in Israeli terms -- of biological pest controlling sweet pepper under protection , 75 percent of the pesticides were actually reduced.
Why good bugs ? 
So safety , with respect to the application , this is the number one answer that we get from growers , why biological control.
It hardly happens.
Even here , there is another grower , you see , very interested in the bugs , the bad ones and the good ones , wearing this magnifier already on her head , just walking safely in her crop.
If we take the overall turnover of the biocontrol industry worldwide , it ' s 250 million dollars.
So there is a huge gap to bridge.
Secondly , to create even more intensive and strict public demand to reduction of chemicals in the agricultural fresh produce.
So I think my last slide is : All we are saying , we can actually sing it : Give nature a chance.

Why do societies fail ?  With lessons from the Norse of Iron Age Greenland , deforested Easter Island and present-day Montana , Jared Diamond talks about the signs that collapse is near , and how -- if we see it in time -- we can prevent it.
I think all of us have been interested , at one time or another , in the romantic mysteries of all those societies that collapsed , such as the classic Maya in the Yucatan , the Easter Islanders , the Anasazi , Fertile Crescent society , Angor Wat , Great Zimbabwe and so on . And within the last decade or two , archaeologists have shown us that there were environmental problems underlying many of these past collapses.
What is there that we can learn from the past that would help us avoid declining or collapsing in the way that so many past societies have ? 
This is a European society with literate records , so we know a good deal about the people and their motivation.
In the case of the Vikings -- in Greenland , the climate got colder in the late 1300s , and especially in the 1400s . But a cold climate isn ' t necessarily fatal , because the Inuit -- the Eskimos inhabiting Greenland at the same time -- did better , rather than worse , with cold climates . So why didn ' t the Greenland Norse as well ? 
And then finally , the fifth item on my checklist is the political , economic , social and cultural factors in the society that make it more or less likely that the society will perceive and solve its environmental problems . In the case of the Greenland Norse , cultural factors that made it difficult for them to solve their problems were : their commitments to a Christian society investing heavily in cathedrals ; their being a competitive-ranked chiefly society ; and their scorn for the Inuit , from whom they refused to learn . So that ' s how the five-part framework is relevant to the collapse and eventual extinction of the Greenland Norse.
Going through the same checklist : human environmental impacts ? 
Fourth : relations with hostiles . Montanans have the same problems as do all Americans , in being sensitive to problems created by hostiles overseas affecting our oil supplies , and terrorist attacks . And finally , last item on my checklist : question of how political , economic , social , cultural attitudes play into this . Montanans have long-held values , which today seem to be getting in the way of their solving their own problems.
In a way , just like Tolstoy ' s statement about every unhappy marriage being different , every collapsed or endangered society is different -- they all have different details . But nevertheless , there are certain common threads that emerge from these comparisons of past societies that did or did not collapse and threatened societies today . One interesting common thread has to do with , in many cases , the rapidity of collapse after a society reaches its peak . There are many societies that don ' t wind down gradually , but they build up -- get richer and more powerful -- and then within a short time , within a few decades after their peak , they collapse . For example , the classic lowland Maya of the Yucatan began to collapse in the early 800s -- literally a few decades after the Maya were building their biggest monuments , and Maya population was greatest.
In a petri dish , bacteria grow . Say they double every generation , and five generations before the end the petri dish is 15/16ths empty , and then the next generation ' s 3/4ths empty , and the next generation half empty . Within one generation after the petri dish still being half empty , it is full . There ' s no more food and the bacteria have collapsed.
Easter , of all Pacific islands , has the least input of dust from Asia restoring the fertility of its soils . But that ' s a factor that we didn ' t even appreciate until 1999.
Didn ' t they see what they were doing ?  How could societies not perceive their impacts on the environments and stop in time ? 
One blueprint for trouble , making collapse likely , is where there is a conflict of interest between the short-term interest of the decision-making elites and the long-term interest of the society as a whole , especially if the elites are able to insulate themselves from the consequences of their actions . Where what ' s good in the short run for the elite is bad for the society as a whole , there ' s a real risk of the elite doing things that would bring the society down in the long run.
And the other generalization that I want to mention is that it ' s particularly hard for a society to make quote-unquote good decisions when there is a conflict involving strongly held values that are good in many circumstances but are poor in other circumstances . For example , the Greenland Norse , in this difficult environment , were held together for four-and-a-half centuries by their shared commitment to religion , and by their strong social cohesion . But those two things -- commitment to religion and strong social cohesion -- also made it difficult for them to change at the end and to learn from the Inuit . Or today -- Australia.
Well , all of us know the dozen sorts of ticking time bombs going on in the modern world , time bombs that have fuses of a few decades to -- all of them , not more than 50 years , and any one of which can do us in ; the time bombs of water , of soil , of climate change , invasive species , the photosynthetic ceiling , population problems , toxics , etc. , etc . -- listing about 12 of them . And while these time bombs -- none of them has a fuse beyond 50 years , and most of them have fuses of a few decades -- some of them , in some places , have much shorter fuses . At the rate at which we ' re going now , the Philippines will lose all its accessible loggable forest within five years . And the Solomon Islands are only one year away from losing their loggable forest , which is their major export . And that ' s going to be spectacular for the economy of the Solomons . People often ask me , Jared , what ' s the most important thing that we need to do about the world ' s environmental problems ? 
The fact is that our present course is a non-sustainable course , which means , by definition , that it cannot be maintained.
The big problems facing the world today are not at all things beyond our control . Our biggest threat is not an asteroid about to crash into us , something we can do nothing about.
Marcel Dicke makes an appetizing case for adding insects to everyone ' s diet . His message to squeamish chefs and foodies : delicacies like locusts and caterpillars compete with meat in flavor , nutrition and eco-friendliness.
Okay , I ' m going to show you again something about our diets.
Because there ' s 80 percent out there that really eats insects.
And here you see just a selection.
In fact , of all animals on Earth , of all animal species , 80 percent walks on six legs.
There was an estimation , a conservative estimation , a couple of years ago that the U.S . economy benefited by 57 billion dollars per year.
Well we know that that was not a cheap war.
They remove dung , they pollinate our crops.
Small animals eat insects.
There ' s quite a lot of people that are eating insects.
And here you see me enjoying a meal with caterpillars , locusts , bee pupae -- delicacies.
More than 1,000 species -- an enormous variety.
What are you eating ? 
If they don ' t have any damage , they go to the grocery.
In fact , all our processed foods contain more proteins than we would be aware of.
In a lot of food items that we have -- I have only two items here on the slide -- pink cookies or surimi sticks or , if you like , Campari -- a lot of our food products that are of a red color are dyed with a natural dye.
One gram of cochineal costs about 30 euros.
The human population is growing very rapidly and is growing exponentially.
How are we going to feed this world ? 
Our diet consists , [in] some part , of animal proteins , and at the moment , most of us here get it from livestock , from fish , from game.
It ' s 25 kilograms per person per year.
And of course , we are not there to say that ' s only for us , it ' s not for them.
You ' ll get proteins in any kind of food anyway.
They ' re even models in medicine , and we can even transplant organs from a pig to a human.
You get a new disease that can be deadly.
You take 10 kilograms of feed , you can get one kilogram of beef , but you can get nine kilograms of locust meat.
We ' re not taking the bonus yet.
If we take 10 kilograms of food -- and it results in one kilogram of beef , the other nine kilograms are waste , and a lot of that is manure.
So you have less waste , and the waste that you have is not as environmental malign as it is with cow dung.
In fact , it ' s comparable to anything we eat as meat at the moment.
I can go on , and I could make many more points for insects , but time doesn ' t allow this.
Even if you don ' t like it , you ' ll have to get used to this because at the moment , 70 percent of all our agricultural land is being used to produce livestock.
We could much better change from meat , from beef , to insects.
So people there are eating them , not because they ' re hungry , but because they think it ' s a delicacy.
In fact , we have delicacy that ' s very much like this grasshopper : shrimps , a delicacy being sold at a high price.
In fact , a locust is a  " shrimp "  of the land , and it would make very good into our diet.
That ' s why we ' re changing the perception of insects.
So we have to get used to the idea of eating insects.
I predict that later this year , you ' ll get them in the supermarkets -- not visible , but as animal protein in the food.
So there ' s even a lot of design to it.
It ' s not something that is a hobby of mine.
A couple of years ago , we had 1,750 people all together in a square in Wageningen town , and they ate insects at the same moment , and this was still big , big news.
Bruno Giussani : Look at them first . Look at them first.
They just make it [with] nuts or something.

And what I ' d like to argue is that that ' s not necessarily the case , as progress is simply a word for change , and with change you gain something , but you also lose something.
If you glance at your iPhone , it ' s so simple to tell the time.
Well , the way you would do it is by using a device that ' s called an astrolabe.
And it was a device that , in fact , is a model of the sky.
If you were an educated child , you would know how to not only use the astrolabe , you would also know how to make an astrolabe.
And the central idea that makes this computer work is this thing called stereographic projection.
Each point on the surface of the sphere is mapped through the bottom pole , onto a flat surface , where it is then recorded.
And the altitude corresponds to the plate system.
And then there is their location on the sky as seen from a certain latitude on the back plate . Okay ? 
And so , this astrolabe is on loan from us from the Oxford School of -- Museum of History.
That ' s the movable part of the sky.
You know , I ' ve always wanted one of these.
But a real one would cost about as much as my house , and the house next to it , and actually every house on the block , on both sides of the street , maybe a school thrown in , and some -- you know , a church.
First thing that you do is you select a star in the night sky , if you ' re telling time at night.
So , step two , I hold the device up , and then I sight its altitude there so I can see it clearly now.
Deneb is there . I can tell.
So , it is , in a sense , holding a model of the universe in my hands.
as you glance at your iPod to just check out the time.
He would not only know what time it was , he would also know where the sun would rise , and how it would move across the sky.
So , affordances are the qualities of an object that allow us to perform an action with it.
On the back there is scales and measurements for terrestrial navigation.
Astrolabes have an incredible history.
There is portable ones . There is large display ones.
So , the earliest retes , for example , were very simple and primitive.
How cool is that ?  This is just amazing.
Well , I think the first thing is that it reminds us just how resourceful people were , our forebears were , years and years ago.
And what we gain with a new technology , of course , is precision and accuracy.
And so , what can you learn from these devices ? 
When Allison Hunt found out that she needed a new hip -- and that Canada’s national health care system would require her to spend nearly 2 years on a waiting list -- she took matters into her own hands.
Allison Hunt : My three minutes hasn ' t started yet , has it ? 
I mean I ' m nervous enough as it is.
Electric saw , power drill , totally disgusting unless you ' re David Bolinsky , in which case it ' s all truth and beauty.
Just two things.
And being the youngest of seven , I have never been at the front of the line for anything . OK ? 
Finally got to see him after 10 months of waiting -- almost a year.
I ' m going to replace your hip -- it ' s about an 18-month wait. " 
I wouldn ' t have my new hip for this TED.
So , I left his office and I was walking through the hospital , and that ' s when I had my epiphany.
We do not think that way.
Hey , are you from Canada ?   " Oh , me too! Hi! " 
No , no . Front of the line.
Well , they signed me up immediately.
So , next thing you know , I had my bright blue volunteer vest , I had my photo ID , and I was fully trained by my 89-year-old boss.
Then I ' d tell them ,  " Well , I ' m getting my hip replaced -- in 18 months.
So , naturally , I had my vest and my identification.
Now , word on the street was that it was actually my volunteering that got me to the front of the line.
But also I intend to stick with the volunteering , which actually leads me to the biggest epiphany of them all.
AI,engineering,robots,science,technology
It stands for Self-excited Tripedal Dynamic Experimental Robot.
But before that , let ' s look at pop culture.
So , this is an actual dynamic simulation animation.
What you ' re doing is you really swing your leg and catch the fall , stand up again , swing your leg and catch the fall.
It ' s a constantly falling process.
And it deploys legs -- it looks almost like  " Star Wars "  -- when it lands , it absorbs the shock and starts walking.
The first version , in the back , that ' s STriDER I.
It ' s a mechanical solution to a problem , instead of using mechatronics.
So , it ' s a wheel-leg hybrid robot.
So , in this video we ' re using an approach called the reactive approach.
You probably haven ' t seen anything like this out there.
The front wheels rotate like this.
We just simply change the length of the spoke.
So , I ' ve been talking to a lot of NASA JPL scientists -- at JPL they are famous for the Mars rovers -- and the scientists , geologists always tell me that the real interesting science , the science-rich sites , are always at the cliffs.
So , what it does , it has three legs . It ' s probably difficult to see , but it has a winch and a cable at the top -- and it tries to figure out the best place to put its foot.
Five years ago I actually worked at NASA JPL during the summer as a faculty fellow.
We actually have a very interesting payload on there.
And also , it does some fun stuff , as can imagine.
This robot is an amoeba robot.
Or use an active tension cords to make it move forward and backward . It ' s called ChIMERA.
Robotic Air Powered Hand with Elastic Ligaments.
We wanted to go tackle this problem in a very different direction.
And it can actually crush an empty soda can.
This is a robot that can climb structures.
The cable over there , that ' s an optical fiber.
In this case it ' s very intuitive ; this student , probably his first time using it , doing very complex manipulation tasks , picking up objects and doing manipulation , just like that . Very intuitive.
This was in 2004 ; at that time , this was something really , really revolutionary.
So , it ' s an open loop control.
It stands up , it walks -- very impressive.
And now DARwIn II is completely autonomous.
Dennis Hong : So , there is actually a competition called RoboCup.
It ' s a true actual goal . It ' s a very ambitious goal , but we truly believe that we can do it.
You ' re going to see the action , three against three , completely autonomous.
What you see over here , this is the beautiful Louis Vuitton Cup trophy.
Last year it actually conducted the Roanoke Symphony Orchestra for the holiday concert.
And it walks away . So , this is DARwIn IV.
So , what is the secret of our success ? 
We also have the world ' s very first vehicle that can be driven by the blind.
So , really , we have five secrets.
At night when I go to bed , 3 - 4 a.m . in the morning , I lie down , close my eyes , and I see these lines and circles and different shapes floating around.
So , I see this , scribble everything down , draw things , and I go to bed.
So , I need to decipher what I wrote.
But just a spark of imagination is not good enough.
The rule is : Nobody criticizes anybody ' s ideas.
They have these wacky , cool , crazy , brilliant ideas , and the whole room is just electrified with creative energy.
He gave a talk about how education and school kills creativity.
Batman , fighting against bad guys , he has his utility belt , he has his grappling hook , he has all different kinds of gadgets.
These are all the tools that we need.
So , I always tell my students ,  " Work smart , then work hard. " 
That ' s really the secret of our success , we ' re having too much fun.
“Desertification is a fancy word for land that is turning to desert,” begins Allan Savory in this quietly powerful talk . And it ' s happening to about two-thirds of the world’s grasslands , accelerating climate change and causing traditional grazing societies to descend into social chaos . Savory has devoted his life to stopping it . He now believes -- and his work so far shows -- that a surprising factor can protect grasslands and even reclaim degraded land that was once desert.
The most massive tsunami perfect storm is bearing down upon us.
But fossil fuels -- carbon , coal and gas -- are by no means the only thing that is causing climate change.
But I have for you a very simple message that offers more hope than you can imagine.
And we have environments where we have months of humidity followed by months of dryness , and that is where desertification is occurring.
I took this picture in the Tihamah Desert while 25 millimeters -- that ' s an inch of rain -- was falling.
Where had that water gone ? 
Now you ' re told over and over , repeatedly , that desertification is only occurring in arid and semi-arid areas of the world , and that tall grasslands like this one in high rainfall are of no consequence.
Almost everybody knows this , from nobel laureates to golf caddies , or was taught it , as I was.
We were once just as certain that the world was flat.
Now no sooner — this was in the 1950s — and no sooner did we remove the hunting , drum-beating people to protect the animals , then the land began to deteriorate , as you see in this park that we formed.
They did . They agreed with me , and over the following years , we shot 40,000 elephants to try to stop the damage.
It made me absolutely determined to devote my life to finding solutions.
So I then began looking at all the research plots I could over the whole of the Western United States where cattle had been removed to prove that it would stop desertification , but I found the opposite , as we see on this research station , where this grassland that was green in 1961 , by 2002 had changed to that situation.
Take one square meter of soil and make it bare like this is down here , and I promise you , you will find it much colder at dawn and much hotter at midday than that same piece of ground if it ' s just covered with litter , plant litter.
Why has it accelerated lately ? 
Now , large herds dung and urinate all over their own food , and they have to keep moving , and it was that movement that prevented the overgrazing of plants , while the periodic trampling ensured good cover of the soil , as we see where a herd has passed.
Now , all of that grass you see aboveground has to decay biologically before the next growing season , and if it doesn ' t , the grassland and the soil begin to die.
And we are burning in Africa , every single year , more than one billion hectares of grasslands , and almost nobody is talking about it.
Okay ?  We cannot reduce animal numbers to rest it more without causing desertification and climate change.
There is no other alternative left to mankind.
All of that grass is now covering the soil as dung , urine and litter or mulch , as every one of the gardeners amongst you would understand , and that soil is ready to absorb and hold the rain , to store carbon , and to break down methane.
We ' d had 10,000 years of extremely knowledgeable pastoralists bunching and moving their animals , but they had created the great manmade deserts of the world.
So rather than reinvent the wheel , I began studying other professions to see if anybody had.
This is land close to land that we manage in Zimbabwe.
Now let ' s go to our land nearby on the same day , with the same rainfall , and look at that.
And we did that by increasing the cattle and goats 400 percent , planning the grazing to mimic nature and integrate them with all the elephants , buffalo , giraffe and other animals that we have.
This was another site where it had been bare and eroding , and at the base of the marked small tree , we had lost over 30 centimeters of soil . Okay ? 
I began helping a family in the Karoo Desert in the 1970s turn the desert that you see on the right there back to grassland , and thankfully , now their grandchildren are on the land with hope for the future.
They put 25,000 sheep in one flock , really mimicking nature now with planned grazing , and they have documented a 50-percent increase in the production of the land in the first year.
What we are doing globally is causing climate change as much as , I believe , fossil fuels , and maybe more than fossil fuels.
We are already doing so on about 15 million hectares on five continents , and people who understand far more about carbon than I do calculate that , for illustrative purposes , if we do what I am showing you here , we can take enough carbon out of the atmosphere and safely store it in the grassland soils for thousands of years , and if we just do that on about half the world ' s grasslands that I ' ve shown you , we can take us back to pre-industrial levels , while feeding people.
Chris Anderson : Thank you . I have , and I ' m sure everyone here has , A )  a hundred questions , B )  wants to hug you.
Allan Savory : Well , we have done this for a long time , and the only time we have ever had to provide any feed is during mine reclamation , where it ' s 100 percent bare.
The best people on our blog are going to come and talk to you and try and -- I want to get more on this that we could share along with the talk . AS : Wonderful.
Designer Emily Pilloton moved to rural Bertie County , in North Carolina , to engage in a bold experiment of design-led community transformation . She ' s teaching a design-build class called Studio H that engages high schoolers '  minds and bodies while bringing smart design and new opportunities to the poorest county in the state.
So this is a story of a place that I now call home.
It ' s about two hours east driving-time from Raleigh.
So there ' s only 27 people per square mile , which comes down to about 10 people per square kilometer.
It ' s the hollowing out of small towns.
And Bertie County is no exception to this.
It is the poorest county in the state.
The biggest employer is the Purdue chicken processing plant.
There are more buildings that are empty or in disrepair than occupied and in use.
Racially , the county is about 60 percent African American , but what happens in the public schools is most of the privileged white kids go to the private Lawrence Academy.
There ' s basically no pool of qualified teachers to pull from , and only eight percent of the people in the county have a bachelor ' s degree or higher.
The biggest asset , in my opinion , one of the biggest assets in Bertie County right now is this man : This is Dr . Chip Zullinger , fondly known as Dr . Z.
And he is an absolute renegade and a visionary , and he is the reason that I now live and work there.
It ' s about designing with people , and letting appropriate solutions emerge from within.
I have strategically cut Matt ' s head out of this photo , because he would kill me if he knew I was using it because of the sweatsuits.
We had fallen in love with the place and the people and the work that we ' re able to do in a rural place like Bertie County , that , as designers and builders , you can ' t do everywhere.
But beyond our personal reasons for wanting to be there , there is a huge need.
The initial goal became using design within the public education system in partnership with Dr . Zullinger -- that was why we were there.
And I should say that these are three things that we ' ve done in Bertie County , but I feel pretty confident that they could work in a lot of other rural communities around the U.S . and maybe even beyond.
This is in response to the awful mobile trailers and the outdated textbooks and the terrible materials that we ' re building schools out of these days.
You come in , you face the wall , you take your test and you leave.
And this also meant the co-creation with some teachers of this educational playground system called the learning landscape.
And then she ' ll call out a math problem -- so let ' s say four times four -- and then one student from each team has to compete to figure out that four times four is 16 and find the tire with the 16 on it and sit on it.
So with design for education , I think the most important thing is to have a shared ownership of the solutions with the teachers , so that they have the incentive and the desire to use them.
This is the most complex.
There are thousands of these blue dots all over the county.
Aside from , you know , getting people excited and wondering what the heck these blue dots were all over the place , it asked the school system to envision how it might become a catalyst for a more connected community.
So  " design as education "  means that we could actually teach design within public schools , and not design-based learning -- not like  " let ' s learn physics by building a rocket, "  but actually learning design-thinking coupled with real construction and fabrication skills put towards a local community purpose.
So we started thinking about the legacy of shop class and how shop class -- wood and metal shop class in particular -- historically , has been something intended for kids who aren ' t going to go to college.
And in recent decades , a lot of the funding for shop class has gone away entirely.
And this is what it looks like.
They ' re paid as employees of Project H to be the construction crew with us to build these projects in the community.
This is Ryan.
So what Studio H might offer her is a way to develop skills so that she might give back in the most meaningful way.
And then this is Anthony.
So this building downtown , which may very well become the site of our future farmers '  market , is now the classroom.
It ' s one project per year , and it makes the youth the biggest asset and the biggest untapped resource in imagining a new future.
Because , when you zoom out that far , you lose the ability to view people as humans.
So while this is a very small story , we hope that it represents a step in the right direction for the future of rural communities and for the future of public education and hopefully also for the future of design.

In fact , if you were to be treated , you might well end up being treated by a person who has no medical credentials as this case from Rajasthan illustrates.
So when I heard these two things , it troubled me deeply , both because of personal reasons and scientific reasons.
As a new father , I have a qualitatively different sense of just how delicate babies are , what our obligations are towards them and how much love we can feel towards a child.
The birth of the idea is from David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel ' s work , two researchers who were at Harvard , and they got the Nobel Prize in 1981 for their studies of visual physiology , which are remarkably beautiful studies , but I believe some of their work has been extrapolated into the human domain prematurely.
That ' s the humanitarian mission.
Prakash , as many of you know , is the Sanskrit word for light , and the idea is that in bringing light into the lives of children , we also have a chance of shedding light on some of the deepest mysteries of neuroscience.
This is an outreach station conducted at a school for the blind.
But , every so often , we come across children who show some residual vision , and that is a very good sign that the condition might actually be treatable.
So , eating burgers actually helps.
In our eyes , the lens is clear , but in this child , the lens has become opaque , and therefore he can ' t see the world.
So , even from that little clip , you can begin to get the sense that recovery is possible , and we have now provided treatment to over 200 children , and the story repeats itself.
I should add a tragic postscript to this -- she died two years ago in a bus accident.
So , we were fairly convinced -- we are convinced -- that recovery is feasible , despite extended visual deprivation.
We treat many more children then we actually work with.
This arc of development gives us unprecedented and extremely valuable information about how the scaffolding of vision gets set up.
The brain has this complex task of putting together , integrating , subsets of these regions into something that ' s more meaningful , into what we would consider to be objects , as you see on the right.
His visual-motor coordination is quite poor , but you get a general sense of what are the regions that he ' s trying to trace out.
So the world is this complex patchwork of regions.
Patient : These are two things.
PS : A very dramatic transformation has come about.
Doctor : What shape do you see here ? 
Doctor : How many things are these ? 
Patient : A square and a circle.
This simple idea has far reaching implications.
I ' m at MIT , at MIT you need to apply whatever basic knowledge you gain.
The way we test Dylan is by giving it inputs , as I said , of the same kind that a baby , or a child in Project Prakash would get.
I had to have long conversations with my wife.
Their acuity -- our acuity is 20/20 ; babies '  acuity is like 20/800 , so they are looking at the world in a very , very blurry fashion.
But then two or three days afterward , babies begin to pay attention to their mother ' s or their father ' s face.
The clinical implication , it comes from the domain of autism.
What you ' re going to see are video clips of two children -- one neurotypical , one with autism , playing Pong.
Even before the ball gets to a place , the child is already looking there.
So we are pursuing this line of work and hopefully we ' ll have more results to report soon.
The Prakash Center will integrate health care , education and research in a way that truly creates the whole to be greater than the sum of the parts.
In this TED archive video from 1998 , paralympic sprinter Aimee Mullins talks about her record-setting career as a runner , and about the amazing carbon-fiber prosthetic legs that helped her cross the finish line.
Sheryl Shade : Hi , Aimee . Aimee Mullins : Hi.
SS : Well , why don ' t you tell them how you got to Georgetown -- why don ' t we start there ? 
They pick three students out of the nation every year to get involved in international affairs , and so I won a full ride to Georgetown and I ' ve been there for four years . Love it.
I played softball for five years growing up.
In fact , I ' d never even met another amputee until I was 17.
And I had these legs that were made of a wood and plastic compound , attached with Velcro straps -- big , thick , five-ply wool socks on -- you know , not the most comfortable things , but all I ' d ever known.
And so I decided to give this a shot : heart pounding , I ran my first race and I beat the national record-holder by three hundredths of a second , and became the new national record-holder on my first try out.
And so I decided to call the track coach at Georgetown.
And I called him up and said ,  " Listen , I ran one race and I won ... " 
And he said ,  " Well , we should meet first , before we decide anything. " 
So this was like ,  " Here we go -- let ' s start on this trip. " 
You can run on our women ' s track team here. " 
In the spring of 1996 , with my goal of making the U.S . Paralympic team that May coming up full speed , I joined the women ' s track team.
Why don ' t you just tell them ? 
It was really , really hot.
And I , I mean , was just mortified -- because I was signed up for the 200 , you know , which went off in a half hour.
And he just sat there like this.
And I did . So , he kept me in line.
AM : No , a year.
So , here we are , a week after the Olympics and down at Atlanta , and I ' m just blown away by the fact that just a year ago , I got out on a gravel track and couldn ' t run 50 meters.
I was the only woman who would be doing the long jump.
No , I made it for the long jump and the 100-meter.
And we ' re at the trainee warm-up track , which is a few blocks away from the Olympic stadium.
And I ' m always looking around , like , where is my competition ? 
I wanted to find out times.
Then I ' m looking : the next lane , lane two , is 12.8.
I ' m sitting there , like ,  " Oh , my god . Oh , my god. " 
Here we are , like , crème de la crème , and there is no doubt about it , that I ' m going to lose big.
And I remember putting my blocks in and just feeling horrified because there was just this murmur coming over the crowd , like , the ones who are close enough to the starting line to see.
And the gun went off , and all I remember was finishing last and fighting back tears of frustration and incredible -- incredible -- this feeling of just being overwhelmed.
I became a collegiate athlete , you know . I became an Olympic athlete.
How many people gave of their time and their expertise , and their patience , to deal with me ? 
That ' s the achievement , I think . That ' s the real achievement.
AM : Well , these are my pretty legs.
And , seriously , like , I can wear heels.
Patrick Ewing , who played for Georgetown in the  ' 80s , comes back every summer.
He didn ' t find it as humorous as I did , anyway.
That ' s another leg I have for , like , tennis and softball.
AM : In these ? 
SS : She can ' t really stand on these legs . She has to be moving , so ...
These are supposed to simulate the actual form of a sprinter when they run.
And I was a guinea pig , as I hope to continue to be in every new form of prosthetic limbs that come out.
AM : Yes , we ' ll do that.
AM : Yes . These I got in a place called Bournemouth , England , about two hours south of London , and I ' m the only person in the United States with these , which is a crime because they are so beautiful.
They ' re also silicon.
And , I mean , it ' s really -- let me take this off so you can see it.
And this is just a silicon piece of skin.
SS : Two weeks ago , Aimee was up for the Arthur Ashe award at the ESPYs.
SS : For 45 minutes . Luckily , the hotel was terrific.
 " No , no , no , no . I ' ve got these special feet that need a two-inch heel . I have a three-inch heel.
No , these legs are great.
SS : That ' s Aimee Mullins.

I ' d therefore like to propose that we employ , we enlist , the cutting edge field of copyright math whenever we approach this subject.
Now this is obviously a powerful , some might say dangerously powerful , insight.
But identifying the actual losses to the economy is almost impossible to do unless we use copyright math.
And TV , satellite and cable revenues are way up.
What we ' re looking at here is the insidious cost of ringtone piracy.
The movie folks also tell us that our economy loses over 370,000 jobs to content theft , which is quite a lot when you consider that , back in  ' 98 , the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicated that the motion picture and video industries were employing 270,000 people.
And some people think that string theory is tough.
Some people think this number ' s a little bit large , but copyright mathematicians who are media lobby experts are merely surprised that it doesn ' t get compounded for inflation every year.
These days an iPod Classic can hold 40,000 songs , which is to say eight billion dollars-worth of stolen media.
I hope you ' ll join me next time when I will be making an equally scientific and fact-based inquiry into the cost of alien music piracy to he American economy.

Those learning it think it ' s disconnected , uninteresting and hard.
Yet math is more important to the world than at any point in human history.
I believe that correctly using computers is the silver bullet for making math education work.
It ' s actually very popular.
And then you get an answer that ' s quantitative in the modern world.
What ' s the point of teaching people math ? 
Over the years we ' ve put so much in society into being able to process and think logically . It ' s part of human society.
What do we mean when we say we ' re doing math , or educating people to do math ? 
People ask the wrong question , and surprisingly enough , they get the wrong answer , for that reason , if not for others.
Turn it from that into some answer in a mathematical form.
And also verify it -- crucial step.
Instead , we ought to be using computers to do step three and using the students to spend much more effort on learning how to do steps one , two and four -- conceptualizing problems , applying them , getting the teacher to run them through how to do that.
There was only one way to do calculating and that was by hand.
So I think in terms of the fact that math has been liberated from calculating.
It ' s the thing you ' d like to avoid if you can , like to get a machine to do.
That ' s an amazing amount of human endeavor.
For example : mental arithmetic.
It ' s still quicker to do that and more practical.
See , the thing we ' re doing right now is we ' re forcing people to learn mathematics.
I was somewhat interested in ancient Greek , but I don ' t think that we should force the entire population to learn a subject like ancient Greek.
Well one of them is , they say , you need to get the basics first.
Are the basics of driving a car learning how to service it , or design it for that matter ? 
A hundred years ago , it ' s certainly true that to drive a car you kind of needed to know a lot about the mechanics of the car and how the ignition timing worked and all sorts of things.
So there ' s another thing that comes up with basics.
She enjoys making what she calls  " paper laptops. " 
If you were born after computers and paper , it doesn ' t really matter which order you ' re taught with them in , you just want to have the best tool.
Do we really believe that the math that most people are doing in school practically today is more than applying procedures to problems they don ' t really understand , for reasons they don ' t get ? 
When they ' re out of education , they do it on a computer.
Why are we using computers to show a student how to solve a problem by hand that the computer should be doing anyway ? 
But you see , when you ' re using a computer , you can just substitute.
They ' ve got hair all over them.
I don ' t think so -- quite the opposite.
I think there is one thing that I think very valid here , which is that I think understanding procedures and processes is important.
If you really want to check you understand math then write a program to do it.
It ' s usually some kind of choice between the vocational and the intellectual.
What I really think we gain from this is students getting intuition and experience in far greater quantities than they ' ve ever got before.
Another thing it allows us to do is reorder the curriculum.
Well , it ' s damn hard doing the calculations , that ' s the problem.
We were talking about what happens when you increase the number of sides of a polygon to a very large number.
Very simple example.
In the end , if we test everyone by hand in exams , it ' s kind of hard to get the curricula changed to a point where they can use computers during the semesters.
This is an actual model where we can be asked to optimize what happens.
So I believe [there is] critical reform we have to do in computer-based math.
In fact , I even talk about us moving from what we often call now the  " knowledge economy "  to what we might call a  " computational knowledge economy, "  where high-level math is integral to what everyone does in the way that knowledge currently is.
And you know if you walk across a chasm , you end up making it worse than if you didn ' t start at all -- bigger disaster.
Now I ' m not even sure if we should brand the subject as math , but what I am sure is it ' s the mainstream subject of the future.
computers,design,interface design,invention,technology,visualizations
It fundamentally changed the way that people thought about computation , thought about computers , how they used them and who and how many people were able to use them.
It ' s like the land and the king they ' re inseparable , they are one.
So it was a necessity.
Networks , we didn ' t have networks at all at the time of the Macintosh ' s introduction , and that has become the single most salient aspect of how we live with computers.
So we ' ve forgotten to invent new interfaces.
Computers and the programming languages that we talk to them in , that we teach them in , are hideously insensate when it comes to space.
So what happens if you start to explain space to them ? 
When you use a mouse , your hand is down here on the mouse pad.
That ' s a digital storage in a physical container.
If you presented it with a chess board , it tried to figure out what you might mean by that.
So you ' ve got an interface that has no interface.
Here , the real world merges with the simulation.
And if you introduce tools like this inverse clock , then you can control the sun ' s position in the sky.
Short shadows at noon and so forth.
Are you blinding passers by and motorists on the freeways ? 
This work is 15 years old.
And the great thing about it was that Alex was so dedicated to the idea of verisimilitude , the idea that the putative 2054 that we were painting in the film be believable , that he allowed us to take on that design work as if it were an R&D effort.
So here we have a bunch of stuff , some images.
And that ' s all well and good.
So navigation is a fundamental issue.
Now we can distribute this stuff in many different ways.
So if we don ' t like stuff , or we ' re intensely curious about Ernst Haeckel ' s scientific falsifications , we can pull them out like that.
If you ' re of a more analytical nature then you might want , actually , to look at this as a color histogram.
And we ' ll perform this Boolean operation because we really love yellow and tapirs on green grass.
And one thing that ' s very important is to combine traditional tabular data with three-dimensional and geospatial information.
And bring out this graph.
That ' s the old way , that ' s the old mantra : one machine , one human , one mouse , one screen.
We might want to ask for some help.
So I ' m going to leave that over there because I have a question for Paul.
Kevin , can you help ? 
So collaborative work , whether it ' s immediately co-located or distant and distinct , is always important.
We at Oblong believe that media should be accessible in much more fine-grained form.
We can grab elements off the front , where upon they reanimate , come to life , and drag them down onto the table here.
Yeah , let ' s take that one.
And I think that it ' s time that we asked for the same from technology.
And , as well , as of efficacy , agency.
CA : When real ?  When for us , not just in a lab and on a stage ? 
We won ' t have succeeded unless we take that next big step.
You know , how can it work ? 
So this is the inevitability about it.
The world has a habit of surprising us as to how these things are actually used.
So , whether it ' s logistics and supply chain management or natural gas and resource extraction , financial services , pharmaceuticals , bioinformatics , those are the topics right now , but that ' s not a killer app.
JU : It ' s been a great pleasure.
culture,entertainment,humanity,humor,religion,writing
And I like to immerse myself in my topics.
So , they answered my emails.
It was a wonderful experience.
So , I decided I would try this for a month.
So , that was hard.
Although , listening to Kevin Kelly , you don ' t have to remember anything.
And I undertook this for two reasons.
But I ' ve become increasingly interested in religion.
The second reason I undertook this is because I ' m concerned about the rise of fundamentalism , religious fundamentalism , and people who say they take the Bible literally , which is , according to some polls , as high as 45 or 50 percent of America.
I had Christian bibles.
And this was a very long list -- over 700 rules.
There is the law in Leviticus ,  " You cannot shave the corners of your beard. " 
So , certainly the challenge was there.
The Bible says that if two men are in a fight , and the wife of one of those men grabs the testicles of the other man , then her hand shall be cut off.
I will say it was an amazing year because it really was life changing , and incredibly challenging.
But it was really interesting , because I was able to make some progress , because I couldn ' t believe how much my behavior changed my thoughts.
So , you know , if you want to become more compassionate , you visit sick people in the hospital , and you will become more compassionate.
In the Proverbs , it says that if you smile , you will become happier , which , as we know , is actually true.
So , I was able to stone one adulterer.
And I explained my project , and he said ,  " Well , I am an adulterer , are you going to stone me ?  " 
But he ' s still an adulterer , and still quite angry.
How should we view the Bible ? 
And it ' s sort of evolved.
This became very , very clear , early on.
But this one is -- the Bible says that you cannot touch women during certain times of the month , and more than that , you cannot sit on a seat where a menstruating woman has sat.
And these are the ultimate literalists.
And they go through these amazing mental gymnastics to accomplish this.
So , whatever you think of creationism -- and I think it ' s crazy -- they did a great job.
And I started to realize the hundreds of little things that go right every day , that I didn ' t even notice , that I took for granted , as opposed to focusing on the three or four that went wrong.
This one was unexpected because I started the year as an agnostic , and by the end of the year , I became what a friend of mine calls a reverent agnostic , which I love.
This was one of the great things about my year , doing the Sabbath , because I am a workaholic , so having this one day where you cannot work , it really , that changed my life.
I wanted it to be about religion in America.
Oh , thank you very much.
That ' s how they printed them in the old Bibles.
So , this was very inspiring to me.
This one was very unexpected because , you know , I grew up with the scientific worldview , and I was shocked learning how much of my life is governed by irrational forces.
And I would say ,  " But that ' s crazy. " 
So the key is to choose the right rituals , the ones that are not harmful -- but rituals by themselves are not to be dismissed.
Because you can ' t.
You ' re just picking and choosing. " 
So , it ' s about choosing the parts of the Bible about compassion , about tolerance , about loving your neighbor , as opposed to the parts about homosexuality is a sin , or intolerance , or violence , which are very much in the Bible as well.
That ' s how I hailed taxicabs.
Clay Shirky looks at  " cognitive surplus "  -- the shared , online work we do with our spare brain cycles . While we ' re busy editing Wikipedia , posting to Ushahidi  , we ' re building a better , more cooperative world.
The story starts in Kenya in December of 2007 , when there was a disputed presidential election , and in the immediate aftermath of that election , there was an outbreak of ethnic violence.
And Okolloh solicited from her commenters more information about what was going on.
There is more information about what ' s going on in Kenya right now than any one person can manage.
That ' s all it is , but that ' s all that ' s needed because what it does is it takes the tacit information available to the whole population -- everybody knows where the violence is , but no one person knows what everyone knows -- and it takes that tacit information and it aggregates it , and it maps it and it makes it public.
It ' s been deployed in Washington D.C . to track snow cleanup.
Now what Okolloh did would not have been possible without digital technology.
I call it cognitive surplus.
The world has over a trillion hours a year of free time to commit to shared projects.
But now that we ' ve been given media tools -- the Internet , mobile phones -- that let us do more than consume , what we ' re seeing is that people weren ' t couch potatoes because we liked to be.
And it ' s those two things together -- ancient human motivation and the modern tools to allow that motivation to be joined up in large-scale efforts -- that are the new design resource.
LOLcats are cute pictures of cats made cuter with the addition of cute captions.
There are other candidates of course , but LOLcats will do as a general case.
There is a spectrum between mediocre work and good work , and as anybody who ' s worked as an artist or a creator knows , it ' s a spectrum you ' re constantly struggling to get on top of.
But media abundance never works that way.
And that source is design for generosity.
Simple , straightforward , commonsensical -- also , largely untested.
Meanwhile , the parents -- perhaps a little busy at work , running late , running errands -- want a little slack to pick the kids up late.
The white group there is the control group ; they change nothing.
And the minute they did that , the behavior in those daycare centers changed.
By adding a fine , what they did was communicate to the parents that their entire debt to the teachers had been discharged with the payment of 10 shekels , and that there was no residue of guilt or social concern that the parents owed the teachers.
But that ' s not right.
And then a really interesting thing happens : Nothing changes.
This brings me back to the LOLcats and to Ushahidi.
Here is the critical difference between these : LOLcats is communal value.
I have a hard time envisioning a future in which someone is saying ,  " Where , oh where , can I find a picture of a cute cat ?  " 
And that kind of civic value is not just a side effect of opening up to human motivation.
The number of people who are going to be able to participate in these kinds of projects is going to grow , and we can see that organizations designed around a culture of generosity can achieve incredible effects without an enormous amount of contractual overhead -- a very different model than our default model for large-scale group action in the 20th century.
We ' ve got this trillion hours a year.
And to the degree we ' re going to do that , to the degree we ' re able to do that , we ' ll be able to change society.

It ' s got everything that you ' d want a normal soap opera to want : It ' s got love , joy , happiness , sadness , tears , laughter , lots of deceit , intrigue.
And that ' s what I ' m going to talk about , how a small change leads to a very big revolution.
And there was this game in March 1939 that started on the third of March and ended on the 14th of March.
Another half an hour and we would have won. " 
The Mahabharata was like that as well , wasn ' t it ? 
Princes patronize the game , not because they love the game , but because it was a means of ingratiating themselves to the British rulers.
Or you could play many games in one small patch of land , even if you didn ' t know which game you were actually in.
And then an enormous accident took place.
There was more 50-over cricket than anywhere.
And so we allowed multinationals into India.
And so one of my friends sitting right here in front of me , Ravi Dhariwal from Pepsi , decided he ' s going to take it all over the world.
Then they said ,  " OK , the next rights are sold for 55 million dollars.
England invented 20 overs cricket , and said ,  " The world must play 20 overs cricket. " 
India didn ' t want to play the T20 World Cup.
The Pakistani batsman trying to clear the fielder.
India , T20 champions.
The accident , of course , there , was that the batsman thought the bowler was bowling fast.
And so there was a feeling that there was great pride in what we can do.
And so , we launched our own T20 league.
The other was Indian cricket.
But was India ready for it ? 
All of a sudden , you had that happening.
So , it was a different India.
The new owners of Indian cricket were not the old princes.
I mean the IPL had 2.3 billion dollars before a ball was bowled , 1.6 billion dollars for television revenue over 10 years , and another 70 million dollars plus from all these franchises that were putting in money . And then they had to appeal to their cities , but they had to do it like the West , right ?  Because we are setting up leagues.
But that ' s all right . What it did also is it changed the way we looked at cricket.
And all of a sudden , Indian sport had awakened to the reality that you can source the best product for the best price anywhere in the world.
And so he said ,  " I ' ve got to reach on date X. " 
Never would India have said ,  " I want a player to play one game for me , and I will use a corporate jet to send him all the way back to Kingston , Jamaica to play a game. " 
There is cricket and the movies.
And something very interesting happened.
So that was the ultimate reason to do well . Take a look -- everyone ' s watching Preity Zinta.
An Indian film star hugging a Pakistani cricketer because they ' d won in Kolkata.
But I thought I ' d take this opportunity -- there ' s a few people from Pakistan in here.
There was criticism too because they said ,  " Players are being bought and sold ? 
How do you fix a price for a player ? 
Shane Warne sold for 450,000 dollars.
Then Andrew Flintoff came by from England , he got one and a half million dollars , and he went back and said ,  " For four weeks , I ' m earning more than Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard , and I ' m earning more than the footballers , wow. " 
That ' s not bad , is it ? 
IPL became the biggest brand in India and , because our elections , had to be moved to South Africa , and we had to start the tournament in three weeks.
Our population , which for a long time we thought was a problem , suddenly became our biggest asset because there were more people watching -- the huge consuming class -- everybody came to watch the cricket.
And , all of a sudden , India was this land of opportunity.
Can you imagine , you ' ve got the dollar on view and there ' s no Delhi belly in there anymore.
You can ' t take a timeless test to China and sit through 14 days with no result in the end , or you can ' t take it all over the world.

Dan Gilbert on our mistaken expectations
And what I want to talk to you about today is what that gift is , and I also want to explain to you why it is that it hasn ' t made a damn bit of difference.
In a sense , what Bernoulli was saying is , if we can estimate and multiply these two things , we will always know precisely how we should behave.
Now , the idea is simple when we ' re applying it to coin tosses , but in fact , it ' s not very simple in everyday life.
Calculating odds would seem to be something rather easy : there are six sides to a die , two sides to a coin , 52 cards in a deck.
The way people figure odds requires that we first talk a bit about pigs.
It was very easy to remember seeing dogs , not so easy to remember pigs . And each one of you assumed that if dogs on leashes came more quickly to your mind , then dogs on leashes are more probable.
Well , you check memory very briefly , make a quick scan , and it ' s awfully easy to say to yourself , Ring , Rang , Rung , and very hard to say to yourself , Pare , Park : they come more slowly.
You kind of shout out the sound , S -- and the word comes.
And these are just ordinary people like yourselves who are asked to guess how many people die from tornado , fireworks , asthma , drowning , etc.
When was the last time that you picked up a newspaper and the headline was ,  " Boy dies of Asthma ?  " 
They don ' t come quickly to mind , and as a result , we vastly underestimate them.
And economists -- forgive me , for those of you who play the lottery -- but economists , at least among themselves , refer to the lottery as a stupidity tax , because the odds of getting any payoff by investing your money in a lottery ticket are approximately equivalent to flushing the money directly down the toilet -- which , by the way , doesn ' t require that you actually go to the store and buy anything.
When was the last time that you saw extensive interviews with everybody who lost ? 
There ' s 10 tickets in this lottery.
The expected value of this lottery is two dollars ; this is a lottery in which you should invest your money.
Do you want it ?  Most people won ' t play this lottery.
The fact that all those tickets are owned by one guy changes your decision to play , even though it does nothing whatsoever to the odds.
Most of you have the intuition that it ' s not -- you wouldn ' t pay that for it.
Suddenly , 25 dollars for a Big Mac might be a good deal.
And this is a systematic error people make.
When people are asked about these two different jobs : a job where you make 60K , then 50K , then 40K , a job where you ' re getting a salary cut each year , and one in which you ' re getting a salary increase , people like the second job better than the first , despite the fact they ' re all told they make much less money . Why ? 
Most people say they would . Here ' s a slightly different story : $2,000 Hawaiian vacation package is now on sale for 700 dollars , so you decide to mull it over for a week.
Here ' s another example of how comparing to the past can befuddle our decisions.
You also have a 20-dollar bill.
Now , let ' s just change one thing in this scenario.
Well , of course , I went to the theater to see the play.
In both cases , it was a piece of paper.
You compare the cost of the play now -- 40 dollars -- to the cost that it used to have -- 20 dollars -- and you say it ' s a bad deal.
One of the things we know about comparison : that when we compare one thing to the other , it changes its value.
Now , retailers knew this long before anybody else did , of course , and they use this wisdom to help you -- spare you the undue burden of money.
If you ' re a smart retailer , then , you will put a very expensive item that nobody will ever buy on the shelf , because suddenly the $33 wine doesn ' t look as expensive in comparison.
This problem of shifting comparisons can bedevil our attempts to make rational decisions.
They ' re sitting in a room with potato chips in front of them.
Of course , what happens when they eat the potato chips ? 
The dealer near your house sells this particular stereo for 200 dollars , but if you drive across town , you can get it for 100 bucks.
Now , let ' s imagine instead you wanted to buy a car that had a stereo , and the dealer near your house had it for 31,000.
This kind of thinking drives economists crazy , and it should.
And if a drive across town is worth 100 bucks , it ' s worth 100 bucks no matter what you ' re saving it on . People don ' t think that way.
If you ' re an American , for example , you ' ve probably traveled in France.
Now , you have exactly the same problem when you shop for a stereo.
What are the odds that years later you ' ll turn on the stereo and go ,  " Sounds so much better than those little ones, "  which you can ' t even remember hearing.
So let me give you one very easy problem , a second very easy problem and then a third , hard , problem.
Here ' s the second problem : You can have 60 dollars today or 60 dollars in a month . Which would you prefer ? 
This typifies a lot of situations in life in which you will gain by waiting , but you have to be patient.
Maybe that isn ' t so remarkable , but what is remarkable is how easy it is to make this impatience go away by simply changing when the delivery of these monetary units will happen.
What makes this dynamic inconsistency happen ? 
These guys can tell us.
However , the difference between them seems to be getting smaller.
And I want you to see that two things are true.
As Plato said , what space is to size , time is to value.
Watch what happens when we drop some out.
That is , as that month 12 approaches , you will say , what was I thinking , waiting an extra month for 60 dollars ? 
The answer to this question , I think , is an answer you ' ve already heard in some of the talks , and I dare say you will hear again : namely , that our brains were evolved for a very different world than the one in which we are living.
We are the only species on this planet that has ever held its own fate in its hands.
Chris Anderson : That was remarkable.
I tried to point out to them that terrorism was a name based on people ' s psychological reaction to a set of events , and that if they were concerned about terrorism they might ask what causes terror and how can we stop people from being terrified , rather than -- not rather than , but in addition to stopping the atrocities that we ' re all concerned about.
These are small-scale accidents , and we should be wondering whether they should get the kind of play , the kind of coverage , that they do.
DG : It ' s out-sized . I mean , look.
CA : What causes the bug ?  Is it the drama of the event -- that it ' s so spectacular ? 
First , it ' s a human agent trying to kill us -- it ' s not a tree falling on us by accident.
CA : I mean , what would it take to persuade our culture to downplay it ? 
CA : But is there a rational fear that actually , the reason we ' re frightened about this is because we think that the Big One is to come ? 
What I ' m saying is that , surely , rationally , our distress about things that happen , about threats , should be roughly proportional to the size of those threats and threats to come.
It ' s not making headlines , it ' s not making news , it ' s not flashy.
CA : There ' s no question.
CA : We ' ve evolved to get all excited about these dramatic attacks . Is that because in the past , in the ancient past , we just didn ' t understand things like disease and systems that cause poverty and so forth , and so it made no sense for us as a species to put any energy into worrying about those things ? 
Is that what happened ? 
Any animal you see that you ' ve seen before is less likely to be a predator than one that you ' ve never seen before.
I know , because I ' ve interviewed about 1,000 lottery buyers over the years.
It ' s not because she is stupid or he is stupid.
And as a result , many people look at economists as stupid people.
I think they think it ' s unlikely , but it could happen , which is why they prefer that to the flushing.
CA : Last question.
DG : For you or for them ? 
But one thing that psychologists have tried that seems to work is to get people to imagine the future more vividly.
Once we have all the details of that imaginary scenario , suddenly we feel like it might be important to save so that that guy has a little retirement money.

Mike Matas : A next-generation digital book
The book starts like this . This is the cover.
And anything you see in the book , you can pick up with two fingers and lift off the page and open up.
Mike Matas : And so throughout the whole book , Al Gore will walk you through and explain the photos.
So you can open this one.
Or we can zoom out to the table of contents , and the video keeps playing.
We can do the same for geothermal energy and solar power.
And as the wind starts dying down , any excess energy will be diverted back into the house -- the lights never go out.
And it works the exact same way.
Chris Anderson : That ' s spectacular.
MM : Yeah , we ' re building a tool that makes it really easy for publishers right now to build this content.
MM : Thank you.

I was asked , I guess about six years ago , to do a series of paintings that in some way would celebrate the birth of Piero della Francesca.
Once I realized that I could take some liberties with the subject , I did the following series of drawings.
He apparently lost an eye in battle , which is why he is always shown in profile.
And then a visitor from another painting by Piero , this is from  " The Resurrection of Christ "  -- as though the cast had just gotten of the set to have a chat.
On another subject -- -- I was driving in the country one day with my wife , and I saw this sign , and I said ,  " That is a fabulous piece of design. " 
Because as soon as you hear the word Dutchman -- which is an archaic word , nobody calls Dutch people  " Dutchmen "  anymore -- but as soon as you hear Dutchman , you get this picture of the kid with his finger in the dike , preventing the thing from falling and flooding Holland , and so on.
Now ,  " Swiss "  works , but you know it ' s going to cost a lot of money.
And this was the text --  " In words as fashion the same rule will hold/ Alike fantastic if too new or old/ Be not the first by whom the new are tried/ Nor yet the last to lay the old aside. " 
So I took another crack at it -- you ' ve got to keep it moving -- and I Xeroxed some words on pieces of colored paper and I pasted them down on an ugly board.
But you can see the beginning of an idea there , because you can see the word  " new "  emerging from the  " old. " 
I had this other version which had something interesting about it in terms of being able to put it together in your mind from clues.
And so , I do something I ' m truthfully ashamed of , which is that I took two drawings I had made for another purpose and I put them together.
But , to my credit , I was so embarrassed about doing that that I never submitted this sketch.
I remember hearing all of you in the graphic arts --  " If you have to explain it , it ain ' t working. " 
Silas usually has a better touch with his choice of quotations.
 " Maybe the words can make the image without anything else happening.
I guess one could reduce the idea further by suggesting that the new emerges behind and through the old , like this. " 
Maybe what wants to be said is that old and the new are locked in a dialectical embrace , a kind of dance where each defines the other. " 
This could be embarrassing.
One is the sort of willingness to expose myself to a critical audience , and not to suggest that I am confident about what I ' m doing.
That can be a big contribution.
Now , this is a little illusion.
And here , a very peculiar poster because , simply because of using the isometric perspective in the computer , it won ' t sit still in the space.
And then an experiment -- a little bit about the nature of perspective , where the outside shape is determined by the peculiarity of perspective , but the shape of the bottle -- which is identical to the outside shape -- is seen frontally.
The idea was -- and it was a brilliant idea -- was to have 10 posters distributed throughout the city ' s subway system so every time you got on the subway you ' d be passing a different poster , all of which had a different idea of what art is.
But then again , it ' s on my list of didactic posters.
The phrase  ' Art is whatever '  expresses the current inclusiveness that surrounds art-making -- a sort of  ' it ain ' t what you do , it ' s the way that you do it '  notion.
And the one that I did not submit , which I still like , I wanted to use the same phrase.
And , of course those are the remains , and they ' re so labeled.
Africa,arts,creativity,culture,entertainment,film,global issues,war
The previous speaker has , I think , really painted a very good background as to the impulse behind my work and what drives me , and my sense of loss , and trying to find the answer to the big questions.
And obviously they were ,  " Is this what you spent years doing ? 
I feel like I’m coming home to talk about what I’ve been away doing for 20 years.
I love her , you know.
Court : Sleep.
Court : Never.
Why does everyone get rid of me ? 
Boy : What do you do all day ? 
Marcus : I am retired.
Marcus : Because I do what I like ? 
Boy : Arguing with you is a waste of time , Marcus.
Boy : Yeah , you could say that.
Boy : Reality , man.
Boy : Racism , oppression , people like me not getting a break in life.
Marcus : And how many soldiers have you recruited to fight this war with you ? 
Marcus : The Panthers.
Director 1 : I saw his last film.
Epuisé -- tired , exhausted , fed up.
W1 : They suck.
D1 : My movies , they are OK , fine.
You make people fuckin '  sleep.
These are the sentiments of someone that ' s been away from home.
And so it’s really -- it ' s really how suddenly , you know , this was made in 1997 , which is the time of Abacha -- the military dictatorship , the worst part of Nigerian history , this post-colonial history.
Again , this was my -- this was me talking about -- this was , again , the time of multiculturalism in the United Kingdom , and there was this buzzword -- and it was trying to say , what exactly does this multiculturalism mean in the real lives of people ? 
But I lived in England for 18 years.
I suppose that will take me to my last piece -- what cinema means for me.
Onicha : Yes , mama.
C : Success , the change is only coming through the barrel of the gun.
C : This is an AK-47 rifle . This is your life.
Soldiers : Rain come , sun come , soldier man dey go.
Witness : We walked and walked for two days.
The injection made us not to have mind.
Ezra : I don’t remember.
The Mende sons of bastards.
So you can stop staring at me.
You know what you are ?  A crocodile.
Troop , pay your last honor . Salute.
I take you are preparing a major attack ? 
That is what you are here for , no ? 
More than that , begin a healing process and finally to -- as an act of closure to a terrible period in this country’s history.
Ezra : My name is Ezra Gelehun.
E : We were fighting for our freedom.
CC : Yes , correct.
If I may ask , do you pay for school in your country ? 
Your country talks about democracy , but you support corrupt governments like my own.
CC : Mr . Gelehun , I ' d like to remind you , you ' re not on trial here today.
E : So you are a liar.
And considering where you are coming from , and when we consider the extent to which it’s not taken as seriously as it should be , what would you have to say about that ? 
I met psychiatrists who spent time with them , aid workers , NGOs , the whole lot.
That’s really my thinking.
EO : Thank you.

When I was 14 my parents bought me a chemistry set and I decided to make water.
I had an explosion.
I ' d like to start this session again.
I mean you have become , whether you can giggle at it because it ' s a funny .. . you know , it ' s a strange thought , but your building is an icon -- you can draw a little picture of that building , it can be used in ads -- and you ' ve had not rock star status , but celebrity status in doing what you wanted to do for most of your life.
But that ' s an interesting thing for a creative person.
It ' s not quite a question but you can comment on it.
I always waited for it to sort of hit me on the head.
That was my response to the people in the time.
We bought this tiny little bungalow in Santa Monica and for like 50 grand I built a house around it.
And it was late in the evening . We ' d had a lot to drink.
But I just found out the world ain ' t going to last that long , this guy was telling us the other day.
For me , every day is a new thing.
So I approach it with the same trepidation.
When Bilbao was finished and I looked at it , I saw all the mistakes , I saw ...
It ' s taken several years to now look at it detached and say -- as you walk around the corner and a piece of it works with the road and the street , and it appears to have a relationship -- that I started to like it.
I didn ' t think he knew what he was doing , and he pulled it off.
September 11 generated some interest in moving it over to Ground Zero , and I ' m totally against that.
RSW : How much further along is it than that , and when will that be finished ? 
He ' s been a cheerleader for quite a long time.
And so to find one , a guy like that , you hang on to him.
I convinced him to let me bring in another architect from Portugal : Alvaro Siza.
Alvaro Siza grew up and lived in Portugal and is probably considered the Portuguese main guy in architecture.
I just stopped.
I tried to get him a couple of jobs and they didn ' t pan out.
RSW : No . What did he say ? 
It must be like that for Kyu doing things with musicians -- it ' s similar to that I would imagine -- where you .. . huh ? 
And I think for me , it ' s a way of trying to understand the city and what might happen in the city.
Anyway , he ' s that kind of patron.
What ' s the schedule , Richard ? 
No , but the issue of city building in democracy is interesting because it creates chaos , right ? 
My preconception of Bilbao was this wonderful building , you go inside and there ' d be extraordinary spaces.
That was the real surprise of Bilbao.
by saying all that , it means your work is good somehow.
If you don ' t meet the budgets , you ' re not going to get much work.
I met them in Bilbao.
They were there three days and it rained every day and they kept walking around -- I noticed they were looking under things and looking for things , and they wanted to know where the buckets were hidden , you know ? 
RSW : Frank had a sort of ...
And he said ,  " Madam , move your chair. " 
FG : No . Not now either.
What do you bring to it ? 
And I think that ' s the issue , you know ; it ' s the  " then what "  that most clients who hire architects -- most clients aren ' t hiring architects for that.
RSW : Did it leak ? 
FG : Yeah.
In one case , I flew all the way to Malaga with a team because the thing was signed with seals and various very official seals from the city , and that they wanted me to come and do a building in their port.
And they took us -- they put us up in a great hotel and we were looking over the bay , and then they took us in a boat out in the water and showed us all these sights in the harbor.
It was a table as long as this carpet and the harbor commissioner was here , and I was here , and my guys.
FG : So , I got up.
I said ,  " Nope. " 
Luckily , I ' m old enough that I can complain I can ' t travel.
FG : Can I say something ? 
RSW : You ' re going to get one! You ' re going to get one!
Laurie Santos looks for the roots of human irrationality by watching the way our primate relatives make decisions . A clever series of experiments in  " monkeynomics "  shows that some of the silly choices we make , monkeys make too.
I want to start my talk today with two observations about the human species.
So we like pointing out the fact that we ' re smart.
Don ' t worry , I ' m not going to call anyone in particular out on any aspects of your own mistakes.
But both of these two embarrassing examples , I think , don ' t highlight what I think is most embarrassing about the mistakes that humans make , which is that we ' d like to think that the mistakes we make are really just the result of a couple bad apples or a couple really sort of FAIL Blog-worthy decisions.
And they ' re actually immune to lots of evidence.
You know , we ' re the smartest thing out there , why can ' t we figure this out ? 
Because we ' re a smart species , we can actually create all kinds of environments that are super , super complicated , sometimes too complicated for us to even actually understand , even though we ' ve actually created them.
If this was the case , we ' d have a really easy solution to the problem of human error.
This is a hint that I ' ve gotten from watching the ways that social scientists have learned about human errors.
We might just have to accept the fact that we ' re error prone and try to design things around it.
And so this is why we turned to these guys here.
You know , so you can take comfort in the fact that this guy up here is a really really distant , but albeit evolutionary , relative.
What if we put Holly into the same context as humans ? 
My students and I got very excited about this a few years ago.
We make a lot of mistakes in a lot of different contexts.
Of course , that ' s when we hit a sort second problem -- a little bit more methodological -- which is that , maybe you guys don ' t know , but monkeys don ' t actually use money . I know , you haven ' t met them.
So we said , well , maybe we should just , actually just suck it up and teach monkeys how to use money.
But this is the unit of currency that we ' ve taught our monkeys at Yale to actually use with humans , to actually buy different pieces of food.
It was useless to the monkeys at first before they realized what they could do with it.
And so you see one of our monkeys , Mayday , up here doing this.
It turns out not just Mayday , all of our monkeys get good at trading tokens with human salesman.
But he too waits patiently , gets his food and goes on.
The question is : is this anything like human money ? 
You might have them start paying attention to price , paying attention to how much they buy -- sort of keeping track of their monkey token , as it were.
When they get a hankering for some treats , we actually allowed them a way out into a little smaller enclosure where they could enter the market.
And over time , they did basically the same thing so the monkeys could learn , you know , who sold what at what price -- you know , who was reliable , who wasn ' t , and so on.
So I ' ll show you a quick video of what this marketplace actually looks like.
All of a sudden the market opens . Here ' s her choice : one grapes or two grapes.
Most of the monkeys went with guys who had better food.
So much so that , if you saw the monkeys '  numbers , you couldn ' t tell whether they came from a monkey or a human in the same market.
One thing we never saw in the monkey marketplace was any evidence of saving -- you know , just like our own species.
So we said , this looks bad.
So we said , let ' s actually give the monkeys the same kinds of problems that humans tend to get wrong in certain kinds of economic challenges , or certain kinds of economic experiments.
Because it ' s yours now ; you can buy whatever you want.
If it comes up heads , you ' re going to get a thousand dollars more.
I ' m just going to give you 500 bucks.
Most people say , why should I be risky when I can get 1,500 dollars for sure ? 
Well , the  " so what ?  "  comes when start thinking about the same problem set up just a little bit differently.
And now imagine that I have you make another choice But this time , it ' s a little bit worse.
And I ' m seeing a lot of furrowed brows out there.
It ' s a 50/50 shot of a thousand or 2,000 , or just 1,500 dollars with certainty.
One is that we have a really hard time thinking in absolute terms.
This is all well and good , except that changes in different directions actually effect whether or not we think options are good or not.
And this means that sometimes we ' ll actually switch our preferences to avoid this.
They ' re why stock investors hold onto losing stocks longer -- because they ' re evaluating them in relative terms.
And so this is what we did , we gave the monkeys choices between guys who were safe -- they did the same thing every time -- or guys who were risky -- they did things differently half the time.
The guy on the left and right both start with one piece of grape , so it looks pretty good.
The guy on the right is actually a risky bonus.
But this is the same choice you guys just faced.
Qualitatively and quantitatively , they choose exactly the same way as people , when tested in the same thing.
Now , the monkeys meet two guys who aren ' t giving them bonuses ; they ' re actually giving them less than they expect.
They guy on the left is a safe loss.
And so what do the monkeys do ? 
This is crazy because it suggests that the monkeys too are evaluating things in relative terms and actually treating losses differently than they treat gains.
But they also do some of the irrational things we do.
So , you know , a little bad -- Sorry , sorry , sorry.
We wanted to know where these kinds of errors came from.
You know , maybe it ' s not just humans at the right side of this chain that ' s duncey.
What do we know about other old strategies like this ? 
You can ' t just look at the dessert cart as say ,  " No , no , no . That looks disgusting to me. " 
When you ' re watching your stocks plummet into the red , when you ' re watching your house price go down , you ' re not going to be able to see that in anything but old evolutionary terms.
Well , the good news , I think , is what I started with at the beginning of the Talk , which is that humans are not only smart ; we ' re really inspirationally smart to the rest of the animals in the biological kingdom.
I don ' t have to rely on my own near-sightedness.
It was Camus who once said that ,  " Man is the only species who refuses to be what he really is. " 
http://www.ted.com/talks/mike_biddle.html
Mike Biddle : We can recycle plastic
And I ' d like to start at the very beginning.
The entire pile is my stuff if I ' m building something.
And let me tell you why I have that perspective.
And if you throw in other durable goods like automobiles and so forth , that number well more than doubles.
And the reason we see mines is because there ' s a lot of valuable raw materials that went into making all of this stuff in the first place.
And what goes into making those toys and tools that we use every single day ? 
And these practices have significant economic and environmental implications that we ' re already starting to see today.
Plastics are a whole other story : well less than 10 percent are recovered.
But actually , plastics are several times more valuable than steel.
They have very different densities.
Plastics have overlapping densities over a very narrow range.
Another consequence of metals being so easy to recycle by humans is that a lot of our stuff from the developed world -- and sadly to say , particularly from the United States , where we don ' t have any recycling policies in place like here in Europe -- finds its way to developing countries for low-cost recycling.
And they extract the metals by hand.
Now because the plastics are so plentiful -- and by the way , those other methods don ' t lead to the recovery of plastics , obviously -- but people do try to recover the plastics.
They bring them below those roofs into small workshops like these , and people try very hard to separate the plastics , by color , by shape , by feel , by any technique they can.
So what are we to do about this space-age material , at least what we used to call a space-aged material , these plastics ? 
And we eventually broke the code.
And in the process , we started recreating how the plastics industry makes plastics.
And not just sustainable from an environmental standpoint , sustainable from an economic standpoint as well.
We have significantly lower capital costs in our plant equipment.
And we make a drop-in replacement for that plastic that ' s made from petrochemicals.
In the short time period I have , I want to show you a little bit of a sense about how we do this.
Even an occasional dead animal , unfortunately.
At the end of this process , we have a mixed plastic composite : many different types of plastics and many different grades of plastics.
And out the end of that part of the process come little flakes of plastic : one type , one grade.
And we chop those strands into what are called pellets.
So now , instead of your stuff ending up on a hillside in a developing country or literally going up in smoke , you can find your old stuff back on top of your desk in new products , in your office , or back at work in your home.
Mother nature wastes very little , reuses practically everything.

Edward Burtynsky on manufactured landscapes
And thinking that , can an individual actually do something , or come up with something , that may actually get some traction out there and make a difference ? 
We have this Great North . And there was a pretty small population , and my father was an avid outdoorsman.
And that , to me , was a reference point that I think I needed to have to be able to make the work that I did.
And I kept being sucked into this genre of the calendar picture , or something of that nature , and I couldn ' t get away from it.
And I ended up in a town called Frackville.
And that became the baseline of what I was doing.
So in that respect , to me , I ' m not against the corporation.
And I ' m not making an indictment towards what ' s happening here , but it is a slow progression.
There ' s something that we ' re not seeing there.
Like a forbidden pleasure . And it ' s that forbidden pleasure that I think is what resonates out there , and it gets people to look at these things , and it gets people to enter it . And it also , in a way , defines kind of what I feel , too -- that I ' m drawn to have a good life.
It ' s even in my own conscience I ' m having it , and here in my work , I ' m trying to build that same toggle.
That in the recycling work that I was doing , I ' m looking for a practice , a human activity that is sustainable.
But in the meantime , these things are scaling up.
They were talking about Exxon Valdez , and that there was going to be a glut of oil tankers because of the insurance industries.
So originally I was going to go to India.
And that , to me , was again something that I started building on , and I continued to build on.
And for me China -- I started photographing it four years ago , and China truly is a question of sustainability in my mind , not to mention that China , as well , has a great effect on the industries that I grew up around.
In fact , when it did actually fill with water a year and a half ago , they were able to measure a wobble within the earth as it was spinning.
This is a  " before and after. "  So that was before.
And it was all the people who lived in those homes , were the ones that were actually taking it apart and working , and getting paid per brick to take their cities apart.
What it is , it ' s a landscape that is an intentional one.
But in China they ' re saying ,  " No , we ' re putting in 27 in the next 10 years. " 
And 1.2 to 2 million people were relocated , depending on whose statistics you ' re looking at.
And again , the rebuilding of the city -- to me , it was sad to see that they didn ' t really grab a lot of , I guess , what we know here , in terms of urban planning.
Here is a sign that , translated , says ,  " Obey the birth control law.
But what ' s really , to me , frightening about the picture and about this billboard is the refinery in the background.
And there ' s about 130 million people in migration trying to get into urban centers at all times , and in the next 10 to 15 years , are expecting another 400 to 500 million people to migrate into the urban centers like Shanghai and the manufacturing centers.
So they bring them in from the country and put them up in the dorms.
This is one with 45,000 , so every lunch , there ' s about 12,000 coming through for lunch.
They ' re called dengzahoos -- they ' re like pin tacks to the ground.
And they ' ve been actually quite successful in getting better deals because most of them are getting a raw deal.
The kinds of collisions of styles and things were quite something , and these are called the villas.
This is a five-level bridge in Shanghai.
There ' s 9,000 of them here , and they ' re being built for most of the big cities , Beijing and Shanghai , Shenzhen.
And the density is quite incredible.
It ' s breathtaking , in terms of the speed at which this city is transforming.
Most recently I went in , and I started looking at some of the biggest industries in China.
So they ' re building very large blast furnaces to try to deal with the demand for steel in China.
10 hours a day at this speed.
And it was just lightning fast ; the way she was working was almost unbelievable.
In this particular case -- this is the assembly line that you saw ; this is a shot of it.
They were just wound up doing these things all day long , until the manager had to , with a stern voice , say ,  " Okay , everybody freeze. " 
There are 500 of these machines ; they ' re worth about 200,000 dollars each.
And that ' s a diptych . I do a lot of pairings to try and get the sense of scale in these places.
The company itself had about 10,000 employees , and they ' re doing domestic shoes.
It just gives you a sense of , again -- and that ' s where , really , the whole migration of jobs started going over to China and making the shoes . Nike was one of the early ones.
This is a textile where they ' re doing shirts -- Youngor , the biggest shirt factory and clothing factory in China.
This was one of the biggest factories I ' ve ever seen.
So it ' s taken me almost a year to gain access into these places.
This is certainly connected to California and Silicon Valley.
And it is a bit of a problem . The way they recycle the boards is that they actually use the coal briquettes , which are used all through China , but they heat up the boards , and with pairs of pliers they pull off all the components.
This portrait -- I ' m not usually known for portraits , but I couldn ' t resist this one , where she ' s been through Mao , and she ' s been through the Great Leap Forward , and the Cultural Revolution , and now she ' s sitting on her porch with this e-waste beside her . It ' s quite something.
They ' ve been sitting on my shoulder the whole time while I ' ve been thinking.
And it isn ' t something that isn ' t just affecting our world , but it starts to go up -- because I think we can start correcting our footprint and bring it down -- but there ' s a growing footprint that ' s happening in Asia , and is growing at a rapid , rapid rate , and so I don ' t think we can equalize it . So ultimately the strategy , I think , here is that we have to be very concerned about their evolution , because it is going to be connected to our evolution as well.
And it is through communications today that I believe that that is not an unreal idea.
And it just started about 14 months ago.
And it ' s looking at technology , and it ' s looking at new energy-saving devices , and it ' s looking at how to rethink and how to re-strategize the movement towards sustainability.
So we ' re looking at this as trying to build out.
And hopefully inspire people to go to that website.
And anything that you can do to promote that would be fantastic.
And you think about it , you know , grade four -- my wife and I , we say age seven is the age of reason , so they ' re into the age of reason . And they ' re pre-puberty.
And one of the ways I thought of doing it is to use my prize , so I would take 30,000 or 40,000 dollars of the winnings , and the rest is going to be to manage this project , but to use that as prizes for kids to get into their hands.
And the prize has to be a verifiable thing , so it ' s not about just ideas.
And I think it starts to motivate the whole idea towards sustainability in a very positive way , and starts to teach them . They know about recycling now , but they don ' t really , I think , get sustainability in all the things , and the energy footprint , and how that matters.
It is my world ; it ' s not someone else ' s . I want to help it ; I want to do something with it . So I think it has a great opportunity to engage the imaginations -- and great ideas , I think , come from kids -- and engage their imagination into a project , and do something for schools.
And the scale of my work , and the kinds of ideas I ' m playing with -- when I first saw an Imax film , I almost immediately thought ,  " There ' s a real resonance between what I ' m trying to do and the scale of what I try to do as a photographer. " 
That would be fantastic . So those are my three wishes.

If you come in you will see us : evening time , at table -- set for ten but not always all seats filled -- at the point when dinner is ready to be served.
Also , while we were at the table , there was a ritual in our family : when something significant had happened for any one of us -- whether mom had just been elected as the president of the PTA , or whether dad had gotten an assignment at the college of our denomination , or whether someone had won the jabberwocky contest for talent -- the ritual at the family was , once the announcement is made , we must take five , ten minutes to do what we call  " make over "  that person -- that is , to make a fuss over the one who had been honored in some way.
Why ?  Because they were old and infirm , and we needed to go by to see if they needed anything.
They would offer sweets or money.
Of course , it was a minister ' s family , so we had to add God into it.
Let me explain a point at which we did not rise to the occasion.
There was a member of his staff who did not have any place on that particular Christmas to celebrate.
This is when we can just be who we are , and now we have this stuffy brother with his shirt and tie on , while we are still in our PJs.
That ' s what the celebration is all about.
We are sisters and brothers united together.
Now that ' s compassion.
Talk about a picture of compassion.
Arm in arm for struggle.
You heard about riots all across the land.
So , sitting on a flatbed truck , the elders of the community are there , and Bobby stands up and says to the people ,  " I have bad news for you.
I know how you feel. " 
I saw it when the Dalai Lama came to the Riverside Church while I was a pastor , and he invited representatives of faith traditions from all around the world.
One more picture while I ' m stinking and thinking about the Riverside Church : 9/11 . Last night at Chagrin Fall , a newspaperman and a television guy said ,  " That evening , when a service was held at the Riverside Church , we carried it on our station in this city.
 ' Find out what it is in your tradition that tells us what to do when we have been humiliated , when we have been despised and rejected. '  And they all spoke out of their own traditions , a word about the healing power of solidarity , one with the other. " 
I have to tangibilitate the Gospel. " 
In my tradition , there is a gift that we have made to other traditions -- to everybody around the world who knows the story of the  " Good Samaritan. " 
And , according to Jesus , the word comes forth ,  " You must love yourself , you must love the Lord your God with all your heart , mind and soul , and your neighbor as yourself. " 
This always seemed to me to be a deepening of the sense of what it means to be a Good Samaritan.
I recall that my work as a pastor has always involved caring for their spiritual needs ; being concerned for housing , for healthcare , for the prisoners , for the infirm , for children -- even the foster care children for whom no one can even keep a record where they started off , where they are going.
I believe that whatever we did around that table at Bloodworth Street must be done around tables and rituals of faith until we become that family , that family together that understands the nature of our unity.
The reason it ' s important is because this is a very special time in history.
Please pardon me , as a black man , for celebrating that the election of Obama was an unusual sign of the fact that it is a year of favor.
And so I want to close with a little song.
The song says , ♫  " I made heaven so happy today , ♫ ♫ Receiving God ' s love and giving it away ♫ ♫ When I looked up , heaven smiled at me ♫ ♫ Now , I ' m so happy . Can ' t you see ?  ♫ ♫ I ' m happy . Look at me . I ' m happy . Can ' t you see ?  ♫ ♫ Sharing makes me happy , makes heaven happy too ♫ ♫ I ' m happy . Look at me . I ' m happy . Can ' t you see ?  ♫ ♫ Let me share my happy loving smile with you . ♫ That ' s compassion.

I ' ve been telling a story that has been so painful for me.
So I have branded myself as a war child.
Or there is no Internet , like Facebook , MySpace , YouTube , for them to talk.
I saw my village burned down.
My brothers and sisters were scattered.
And not only that , when I was eight I became a child soldier.
The training wasn ' t easy , but that was the driving force , because I wanted to revenge for my family.
It was somebody sitting somewhere manipulating the system , and using religion to get what they want to get out of us , which is the oil , the diamond , the gold and the land.
So that pain has gone out.
I talk about my story.
My dreams are like torment.
In the burning jungle , and the desert plain.
I knew it was rude , but we needed food.
Left home at the age of seven.
I ' ve seen my people die like flies.
As a child so young and tender , Words I can ' t forget I still remember.
Yet as I wage this new war I ' m not alone in this drama.
It ' s like I ' m living a dream.
Left home.
So many people die that I don ' t even cry no more.
I ate snails , vultures , rabbits , snakes , and anything that had life.
Thank you.
It ' s been where I actually see heaven , where I can be happy , where I can be a child again , in dances , through music.
You know , if you fall in love with a frog , that ' s it.
So we party and dance to their music.
So now I ' m doing music so I know what the power of music is.
I don ' t eat breakfast . No lunch.
And I ' m doing this because also it ' s a normal thing in my home , people eat one meal a day.
I thought I was famous enough that I would raise the money within one month , but I ' ve been humbled.
The people are giving three dollars.
But that moved me.
As a nation we have been crippled.
So these people , you ' re killing a whole generation if you just give them aid.
Invest in education.
That ' s what I ' m asking.
And I said  " I ' m going to put it in practice. " 
But I ' ll ask you guys to stand up so we celebrate the life of a British aid worker called Emma McCune that made it possible for me to be here.
So she even ended up marrying a commander from the SPLA.
Are you guys ready to celebrate Emma ? 
Big scream for Emma everybody.

Julia Sweeney on letting go of God
But , more importantly , being seven means that you ' ve reached the age of reason , and you ' re now capable of committing any and all sins against God and man. " 
And my dad said ,  " Well , we believe in the Catholic Church that God knows that little kids don ' t know the difference between right and wrong , but when you ' re seven , you ' re old enough to know better.
And I thought ,  " How could I not have known this before ? 
So I said ,  " Well , Mom and Dad , what about Santa Claus ? 
I mean , she ' s seven . Julie , there is no Santa Claus. " 
Which made me very suspicious.
There ' s only one obvious conclusion to reach from this mountain of evidence : our family was too strange and weird for even Santa Claus to come visit , and my poor parents were trying to protect us from the embarrassment , this humiliation of rejection by Santa , who was jolly -- but , let ' s face it , he was also very judgmental.
They had to fit two criteria : they had to be old enough to be able to understand the whole concept of the age of reason , and not yet seven.
I just realized that the age of reason starts when you turn seven , and then you ' re capable of committing any and all sins against God and man. "  And Bill said ,  " So ?  "  And then I said ,  " So , you ' re six . You have a whole year to do anything you want to and God won ' t notice it. "  And he said ,  " So ?  "  And I said ,  " So ?  So everything! "  And I turned to run . I was so angry with him.
September 10 is not your birthday . It ' s October 10. "  And I said ,  " What ?  " 
I thought about it , and when I was four , I was already the oldest of four children , and my mother even had another child to come , so what I think she understandably really meant was that she was so ready , she was so ready . Then she said ,  " Don ' t worry , Julie , every year on October 10 when it was your birthday but you didn ' t realize it , I made sure that you ate a piece of cake that day. " 
I had a huge Virgo poster in my bedroom , and I read my horoscope every single day , and it was so totally me.
This was around the time that I started filling out physically , and I was filling out a lot more than a lot of the other girls , and , frankly , the whole idea that my astrological sign was a scale just seemed ominous and depressing.
One day , two Mormon missionaries came to my door.
So , normally I just ignore the doorbell , but on this day I answered.
And I sat them down , and I got them glasses of water -- OK , I got it . I got them glasses of water.
And I thought ,  " Well , of course I believe in God , but , you know , I don ' t like that word , heart , because it anthropomorphizes God , and I don ' t like the word ,  ' his, '  either , because that sexualizes God. " 
And they said ,  " Well , then we have a story to tell you. " 
He led them to America.
Then , after Jesus died on the cross for our sins , on his way up to heaven he stopped by America and visited the Nephites.
And he made sure this whole story was written down in reformed Egyptian hieroglyphics chiseled onto gold plates , which he then buried near Palmyra , New York.
And I said ,  " So , you believe the Native Americans are descended from a people who were totally evil ?  "  And they said ,  " Yes. " 
I mean , even the Scientologists know to start with a personality test before they start -- -- telling people all about Xenu , the evil intergalactic overlord.
And they said ,  " No. "  And I said ,  " Why ?  "  And they said ,  " Well , it ' s because God gave women a gift that is so spectacular , it is so wonderful , that the only gift he had left over to give men was the gift of prophecy. " 
They said ,  " Well , it ' s her ability to bear children. " 
And I said ,  " Oh , dear -- -- that wouldn ' t be such a good incentive for me. " 
I said ,  " Oh -- now , I don ' t have a uterus because I had cancer a few years ago . So , does this mean that if I went to heaven I would get my old uterus back ?  "  And they said ,  " Sure. " 
Well , then they gave me this Book of Mormon , and they told me to read this chapter and that chapter , and they said they ' d come back some day and check in on me , and I think I said something like ,  " Please don ' t hurry, "  or maybe it was just ,  " Please don ' t, "  and they were gone.
So , I couldn ' t let myself feel condescending towards these boys.
Well , that would have been much different , I think I would have instantly answered ,  " Yes , yes , I feel it all the time . I feel God ' s love when I ' m hurt and confused , and I feel consoled and cared for . I take shelter in God ' s love when I don ' t understand why tragedy hits , and I feel God ' s love when I look with gratitude at all the beauty I see. "

He said ,  " I have a dream. " 
It ' s a beautiful piece of filmmaking , but everything is desolate , everything is dead.
We have focused on the worst-case scenario.
And any psychologist will tell you that fear in the organism is linked to flight mechanism.
People are freezing and running away because we ' re using fear.
This is somehow appealing to human greed instead of fear -- that more is better.
In fact , the architect of our national accounting system , Simon Kuznets , in the 1930s , said that ,  " A nation ' s welfare can scarcely be inferred from their national income. " 
And indeed , we were so successful at producing certain types of stuff that we destroyed a lot of Europe , and we had to rebuild it afterwards.
How crazy is that ?  That our measure of progress , our dominant measure of progress in society , is measuring everything except that which makes life worthwhile ? 
This is from a global survey.
It ' s there , but it ' s not nearly as important as happiness , and it ' s not nearly as important as love.
These seem to be natural human aspirations.
And we created , at the organization that I work for , the New Economics Foundation , something we call the Happy Planet Index , because we think people should be happy and the planet should be happy.
But we have to remember that there ' s a fundamental input to that , and that is how many of the planet ' s resources we use.
When it has a scarce resource that it wants to turn into a desirable outcome , it thinks in terms of efficiency.
And probably the easiest way to show you that , is to show you this graph.
It ' s about the well-being of nations.
Now , there ' s a huge array of nations around that global average.
In Hobbesian terms , life is short and brutish there.
There are some countries up there , yellow triangles , that are doing better than global average , that are heading up towards the top left of the graph.
The country on its own up at the top is a place I haven ' t been to.
That is longer than in the USA.
What ' s going on there ? 
Their government is one of the first to commit to be carbon neutral by 2021.
And they have that Latin vibe , don ' t they.
And the challenge , really , is to pull the global average up here.
That ' s one way of looking at it.
And so in strict happy-planet methodology , we ' ve become less efficient at turning our ultimate scarce resource into the outcome we want to.
A child entering school today will be my age in 2050.
That is changing our business.
None of us , I think , want human progress to stop.
I think this is what they want . They want quality of life to keep increasing.
Now that ' s all very easy to draw graphs and things like that , but the point is we need to turn those curves.
What would that look like for society ? 
Did we meet our three percent annual target on reducing carbon emissions ? 
At a business level , you might look at the well-being of your employees , which we know is really linked to creativity , which is linked to innovation , and we ' re going to need a lot of innovation to deal with those environmental issues.
What are these for happiness ? 
And the point of these is they are , not quite , the secrets of happiness , but they are things that I think happiness will flow out the side from.
The second one is be active.
How aware are you of things going on around the world , the seasons changing , people around you ? 
Older people who keep learning and are curious , they have much better health outcomes than those who start to close down.
Keep learning.
You can do an experiment where you give two groups of people a hundred dollars in the morning.
They don ' t have any carbon content.
He said ,  " I know there are challenges ahead , there may be trouble ahead , but I fear no one . I don ' t care.
Human beings want to be happy.

Ananda Shankar Jayant fights cancer with dance
Since then -- it ' s been four decades now -- I ' ve trained with the best in the field , performed across the globe , taught young and old alike , created , collaborated , choreographed , and wove a rich tapestry of artistry , achievement and awards.
Yes , breast cancer.
As a dancer , I know the nine rasas or the navarasas : anger , valor , disgust , humor and fear.
I said ,  " Is this it ?  Is this the end of the road ? 
So here I was wallowing in a vortex of emotions and depression and what have you , with the enormity of the situation , wanting to go to a place of healing , health and happiness.
I said ,  " Cancer ' s only one page in my life , and I will not allow this page to impact the rest of my life. " 
And I found that in my dance , my dance , my strength , my energy , my passion , my very life breath.
How do you not despair when , with the body ravaged by chemotherapy , climbing a mere flight of stairs was sheer torture , that to someone like me who could dance for three hours ? 
So I would drag myself into my dance studio -- body , mind and spirit -- every day into my dance studio , and learn everything I learned when I was four , all over again , reworked , relearned , regrouped.
And slowly , I moved out of that miserable state of mind.
Durga , the mother goddess , the fearless one , created by the pantheon of Hindu gods.
I made that image of Durga and her every attribute , her every nuance , my very own.
What I had done is I had tuned out of cancer and tuned into my dance.
My story is the power of choice.
It ' s the power of an image.
I present to you an excerpt of that work  " Simhanandini. "

Now , 20 years on , at TED , I want to ask your help in a new reframing.
And so he gave me the time to code it up.
Well , it was basically frustration.
So that , in all that diversity , if I wanted to figure out how to build something out of a bit of this and a bit of this , everything I looked into , I had to connect to some new machine , I had to learn to run some new program , I would find the information I wanted in some new data format.
In fact , on all these discs there were documents.
But in general it was difficult -- it was really difficult to explain what the web was like.
Not impressive.
Well , some people did.
That ' s what it was like then.
It ' s been a blast , hasn ' t it ? 
Turns out that there is still huge unlocked potential.
More or less , you read them , you can follow links from them , and that ' s it.
Hans put up this presentation in which he showed , for various different countries , in various different colors -- he showed income levels on one axis and he showed infant mortality , and he shot this thing animated through time.
Because data you can ' t naturally use by itself But in fact , data drives a huge amount of what happens in our lives and it happens because somebody takes that data and does something with it.
And I was happy to see that at the party last night that he was still saying , very forcibly ,  " It ' s really important to have a lot of data. " 
We ' re using them for people , we ' re using them for places , we ' re using them for your products , we ' re using them for events.
So the second rule is I get important information back.
This person was born in Berlin ; Berlin is in Germany.
So I can browse this stuff.
The idea of linked data is that we get lots and lots and lots of these boxes that Hans had , and we get lots and lots and lots of things sprouting.
The meme went out there.
So he wrote a program to take the data , extract it from Wikipedia , and put it into a blob of linked data on the web , which he called dbpedia.
This is just the grassroots stuff again , OK ? 
We could talk about government data , enterprise data is really important , there ' s scientific data , there ' s personal data , there ' s weather data , there ' s data about events , there ' s data about talks , and there ' s news and there ' s all kinds of stuff.
And I hope that they will put it up as linked data.
I can use it in my company.
You hug your database , you don ' t want to let it go until you ' ve made a beautiful website for it.
OK , we have to ask for raw data now.
Tim Berners-Lee : Can you say  " data "  ? 
TBL : Alright ,  " raw data now " !
And it ' s not just governments , of course -- it ' s enterprises as well.
But a lot of the state of knowledge of the human race at the moment is on databases , often sitting in their computers , and actually , currently not shared.
Well , you take that mouthful and you put it into Google.
The power of being able to ask those questions , as a scientist -- questions which actually bridge across different disciplines -- is really a complete sea change.
But , that ' s not true.
You say ,  " This photograph , it ' s about -- it depicts this person .  "  Bing! That ' s data . Data , data , data.
The way to break down the silos is to get inter-operability between social networking sites.
Zoom in and that square thing is a theater -- which we ' re in right now -- The Terrace Theater . It didn ' t have a name on it.
I did that to the map . I just did that!
It ' s about people doing their bit to produce a little bit , and it all connecting.
And we ' ve practiced that.
You get this really huge power out of it.
I want you to make it.
Daniel Goleman , author of <em>Emotional Intelligence</em> , asks why we aren ' t more compassionate more of the time.
You know , I ' m struck by how one of the implicit themes of TED is compassion , these very moving demonstrations we ' ve just seen : HIV in Africa , President Clinton last night.
A group of divinity students at the Princeton Theological Seminary were told that they were going to give a practice sermon and they were each given a sermon topic.
As they went from the first building to the second , each of them passed a man who was bent over and moaning , clearly in need . The question is : Did they stop to help ? 
There ' s a new field in brain science , social neuroscience.
There are these newly identified neurons , mirror neurons , that act like a neuro Wi-Fi , activating in our brain exactly the areas activated in theirs . We feel  " with "  automatically.
And the simple fact is , if we are focused on ourselves , if we ' re preoccupied , as we so often are throughout the day , we don ' t really fully notice the other.
Then I started to think about the people in the Himalayas whose cataracts would be helped , and I realized that I went from this kind of narcissistic self-focus to altruistic joy , to feeling good for the people that were being helped . I think that ' s a motivator.
Women sit at tables and men go from table to table , and there ' s a clock and a bell , and at five minutes , bingo , the conversation ends and the woman can decide whether to give her card or her email address to the man for follow up . And this woman says ,  " My brother ' s never gotten a card , and I know exactly why.
And apparently Epstein aced the test , therefore the article.
There is a newly coined word in the English language for the moment when the person we ' re with whips out their BlackBerry or answers that cell phone , and all of a sudden we don ' t exist.
At any rate , at one point my brother-in-law , Leonard , decided to write a book about a serial killer.
For one thing , he ' s almost seven feet tall.
They ' re controlled by different parts of the brain.
And the strangler says very matter-of-factly ,  " Oh no . If I ' d felt the distress , I could not have done it.
Think about going shopping and think about the possibilities of a compassionate consumerism.
Or we don ' t know if that fabric is a technological or manufacturing nutrient ; it can be reused or does it just end up at landfill ?  In other words , we ' re oblivious to the ecological and public health and social and economic justice consequences of the things we buy and use.
And it talks about where the cotton was grown and the fertilizers that were used and the consequences for soil of that fertilizer . And it mentions , for instance , that cotton is very resistant to textile dye ; about 60 percent washes off into wastewater.
Well , I ' ve been thinking . For one thing , there ' s a new electronic tagging technology that allows any store to know the entire history of any item on the shelves in that store.
In other words , at point of purchase , we might be able to make a compassionate choice.
And I spent a couple of weeks going around with a social work agency that ministered to the homeless . And I realized seeing the homeless through their eyes that almost all of them were psychiatric patients that had nowhere to go . They had a diagnosis . It made me -- what it did was to shake me out of the urban trance where , when we see , when we ' re passing someone who ' s homeless in the periphery of our vision , it stays on the periphery.
And because my urban trance had been somehow weakened , I found myself stopping to find out what was wrong.
This guy was back on his feet immediately.

Richard Branson : Thank you very much . The first TED has been great.
I ' d had dinner with her about two years ago and I ' d -- she had this big wedding ring and I put it on my finger and I couldn ' t get it off.
CA : That ' s pretty good.
And then , yes , all these other ones as well . I mean , how do you do this ? 
RB : No , I mean , I think I learned early on that if you can run one company , you can really run any companies.
And if I see -- you know , if I fly on somebody else ' s airline and find the experience is not a pleasant one , which it wasn ' t , 21 years ago , then I ' d think , well , you know , maybe I can create the kind of airline that I ' d like to fly on.
I had a conversation with one of the investment bankers who , at the time when you basically sold Virgin Records and invested heavily in Virgin Atlantic , and his view was that you were trading , you know , the world ' s fourth biggest record company for the twenty-fifth biggest airline and that you were out of your mind.
We had -- we were being attacked by British Airways.
CA : Post-Napster , you ' re looking like a bit of a genius , actually , for that as well.
What does the brand stand for in your head ? 
As I say , we go in and shake up other industries , and I think , you know , we do it differently and I think that industries are not quite the same as a result of Virgin attacking the market.
CA : I was actually also curious why -- I think you missed an opportunity with your condoms launch . You called it Mates.
I mean , we had -- often , when you launch a company and you get customer complaints , you know , you can deal with them.
So , it all worked out well.
I mean , what are the numbers on this ? 
CA : And how many employees ? 
RB : Yeah . We were launching a megastore in Los Angeles , I think.
RB : Dropping in for tea.
RB : It ' s a tough job , isn ' t it ? 
But the trouble is , it kept on tipping over , but -- CA : Designed by Philippe Starck perhaps ? 
RB : Yeah , well , 25 years earlier , we ' d launched the Sex Pistols '   " God Save The Queen, "  and I ' d certainly never expected that 25 years later -- that she ' d actually knight us.
RB : Nobody ' s ever called me Sir Richard.
RB : No . I suppose if you ' re having problems getting a booking in a restaurant or something , that might be worth using it.
I think , with us , we ' ve got a video that shows what you ' re up to , and Virgin Galactic up in the air.
CA : So this interior is Philippe Starcke designed ? 
But he ' s an absolute genius when it comes to design.
RB : Yeah ?  No , he is a -- CA : Well , some people found it wonderful , some people found it completely bizarre.
Have you ever regretted that ? 
So in those moments , you certainly wonder what you ' re doing up there or -- CA : What was the closest you got to -- when did you think , this is it , I might be on my way out ? 
And it was like holding onto a thousand horses.
RB : No , he told me jump , but once his weight had gone , the balloon just shot up to 12,000 feet and I ...
CA : Did you jump ?  Or it came down in the end ? 
And then finally , just thought , there ' s a better way.
But it was a wonderful feeling being in that water and -- CA : What did you write to your family ? 
The years -- and until I stopped looking at the polls , you were sort of regarded as this great hero in the U.K . and elsewhere.
CA : They have a point , Richard.
CA : OK , this isn ' t exactly hardball . OK.
And it was one of the reasons I left school when I was 15 years old.
And so the board meetings have been fascinating.
RB : Well , I hope it ' s net actually , having -- -- I ' ve got it right.
And that ' s the profits you ' ve got left over in this little net , everything else is eaten. " 
RB : Yeah , I think I was a bit of a maverick and -- but I .. . And I was , yeah , I was fortunately good at sport , and so at least I had something to excel at , at school.
RB : She was , you know , she felt that we needed to stand on our own two feet from an early age.
CA : But is there a risk here ? 
So I don ' t think you can mollycoddle your kids too much really.
RB : Well , I ' ve done both . I think I went to prison first.
And one of the problems young people have is venereal disease.
So , we put it back to VD and promptly got arrested.
And so I rang up Nottingham University , and I asked to talk to the professor of linguistics.
And so I said ,  " Would you mind coming to the court ?  " 
RB : So our key witness argued that it was actually  " Never Mind the Priest , Here ' s the Sex Pistols. " 
A lot of people would say there ' s no way that someone could put together this incredible collection of businesses without knifing a few people in the back , you know , doing some ugly things.
RB : I don ' t actually think that the stereotype of a businessperson treading all over people to get to the top , generally speaking , works.
CA : And what about the people who love you and who see you spending -- you keep getting caught up in these new projects , but it almost feels like you ' re addicted to launching new stuff.
RB : I also believe that being a father ' s incredibly important , so from the time the kids were very young , you know , when they go on holiday , I go on holiday with them.
What is that ? 
And I think it ' s important that the individuals , who are in that fortunate position , do not end up competing for bigger and bigger boats , and bigger and bigger cars , but , you know , use that money to either create new jobs or to tackle issues around the world.
We need to try to encourage people to come up with a way of extracting carbon out of the Earth ' s atmosphere.
CA : And you ' re also working in Africa on a couple of projects ? 
And so disseminating that information to around the rest of Africa is important.
RB : Well , first of all , on this particular situation , we ' re actually -- we ' re working with the government on it.
But I think business leaders can bring their entrepreneurial know-how and help governments approach things slightly differently.
What would you say to them ? 
CA : How old are you ? 
I mean , it seems like you ' re still a little bit in the growth phases , you ' re still doing these incredible new plans.
No , I just want to live life to its full.
If they had that kind of wealth and they didn ' t care about the world , it would be very worrying.
And you actually did inspire me . I looked at you , I thought , well , he ' s made it . Maybe there is a different way.
art,arts,design,entertainment,visualizations
It ' s like after every exam , when I walk out , the teacher would say ,  " Hey , come.
So it went on like that , and I didn ' t know where else to find myself.
Then , when I was in eighth standard around 13 years old , I started working in a part-time job in one of the signboard artists called Putu.
And one of those competitions , I just won a small , little transistor Philips radio.
So at that time -- and I was 13 -- and I was listening to just radio , and someone happened to sit next to me , like these three people are sitting here.
And he said ,  " Oh , I teach at a college of arts.
It is that we need we need to be open and fine-tuned.
So I was thinking , but when you look at the past , the way to understand the past is only by the traces available , because we cannot go back [to] the past.
So I was working on the line , but instead of working about traces , I started capturing traces.
So here , what happened then , you know -- what I really enjoyed the most is that this sculpture is nothing but a trace of myself.
And then moved slowly to explore the other possibilities of capturing traces.
This is the trace of fire , this is the trace of sun.
This is called  " Dawn to Dawn. " 
Even though we have traces when we try to understand them , the perception and context play a major role to understand it.
How many of you saw a cow crossing in India while you were coming from Bangalore to Mysore ? 
Why the cow was crossing the road , you know.
Imagine Moses comes now , and he sees the same cow walking around the street.
Or Buddha -- if he saw the same cow , he would say ,  " Asking this question denies your own nature [as a] cow. " 
You know , I could just show you this little piece of paper.
If you look at this piece of paper , this is the breadth and this is called length.
It ' s just that being a human , the way we train to perceive the reality creates this meaning.
So this is a work of art , which is just trying to explore that.
It ' s about six inches deep in the wall , but it just appears like it ' s coming out of the wall.
It ' s a full-figure cast from myself.
I couldn ' t find it.
The process to get to make the sculpture was interesting , because I wrote to Balsara , who produces that air freshener called Odonil , saying ,  " Dear Sir , I am an artist . This is my catalogue.
So I told them ,  " I ' d like to start an air freshener company. " 
Please come for the show. " 
You buy this for 3,000 rupees , it ' ll become 30,000 in two months.
It ' s just all about questioning the preconceptions.
It ' s in the same gallery or in the same museum.
 " Light makes dark and now evaporating self.
Can you make something from nothing as a sculptor ?  " 
It ' s called  " Emerging Angel. " 
Through that small little slit between the glass box and the wood , the air goes underneath the sculpture and creates the other one.
And what I ' d like to tell you is we don ' t see shadow , and we don ' t see light too ; we see the source of the light.
The same thing in the darkroom.
Because , as a visual artist , if I ' m seeing this and I ' m seeing that -- but how to sculpt this , you know ? 
I did this as an experiment of casting the shadow.
Then I thought , okay , let me sculpt that.
And then again , at that point , there is no shadow.
It ' s called  " Breath. "  It ' s just two holes on the gallery wall.
This is from the show called  " Invisible, "  at Talwar Gallery.
We don ' t feel ,  " I am touching the air, "  but if the breeze is a little more faster , then I can feel it.
Because when we see someone walks , we see the footprint.

So he taught me that physics is cool because it teaches us so much about the world around us.
Pretty good . And at school ? 
We ' ll start with something very simple -- Newton ' s Law :  " The force equals mass times acceleration. " 
And that ' s one of the reasons why Arthur Andersen chose to launch Accenture rather than try to persuade the world that Andersen ' s could stand for something other than accountancy.
So think about a portfolio of brands or maybe new brands for new ventures.
So to explain that -- if you ' ve got an elementary particle and you shine a light on it , then the photon of light has momentum , which knocks the particle , so you don ' t know where it was before you looked at it.
So with the act of observing consumers , changes their behavior.
And if you think about the number of people who claim in surveys to regularly look for porn on the Web , it ' s very few.
So the physics is you can never accurately and exactly measure a particle , because the observation changes it.
And only one contrary data point can blow your theory out of the water.
Take BP -- they spent millions of pounds over many years building up its credentials as an environmentally friendly brand , but then one little accident.
Well , you know the story.
And lastly , to the slightly obscure world of entropy -- the second law of thermodynamics.
But where we are today , things have changed.
Your brand starts being dispersed , it gets more chaotic.
This distribution of brand energy gets your brand closer to the people , more in with the people.
You can ' t fight it , so embrace it and find a way to work with it.
Africa,art,business,design,short talk
But modernization actually brought communication and a whole new material , in the form of telephone wire.
In the  ' 90s , my interest and passion for transitional art forms led me to a new form , which came from a squatter camp outside Durban.
At the same time , I was thinking , well , there ' s lots of possibility here to produce contemporary products , away from the ethnic , a little bit more contemporary.
They come on a weekly basis to Durban.
This is the community that I originally showed you the slide of.
Caroline Phillips cranks out tunes on a seldom-heard folk instrument : the hurdy-gurdy , a.k.a . the wheel fiddle . A searching , Basque melody follows her fun lesson on its unique anatomy and 1,000-year history.
Now , since this is TEDGlobal , who can tell me what this is called in French ? 
Hurdy-gurdy , or wheel fiddle.
The first string is the drone string , which plays a continuous sound like the bagpipe.
It activates what ' s called the buzzing bridge , or the dog.
So , one person could actually play and almost -- this is pretty heavy -- carry the hurdy-gurdy.
It ' s made by specialized luthiers , also in Europe.
CP : Okay.
This is a song that I wrote based on traditional Basque rhythms.
Anthropologist Helen Fisher takes on a tricky topic -- love –- and explains its evolution , its biochemical foundations and its social importance . She closes with a warning about the potential disaster inherent in antidepressant abuse.
I ' d like to talk today about the two biggest social trends in the coming century , and perhaps in the next 10,000 years.
And so I want to tell you about that first , and then go on into where I think love is going.
The first thing that happens is what I call -- a person begins to take on what I call ,  " special meaning. " 
And indeed , that ' s what we do.
In trying to understand romantic love , I decided I would read poetry from all over the world , and I just want to give you one very short poem from eighth-century China , because it ' s an almost perfect example of a man who is focused totally on a particular woman.
And it goes like this . It ' s by a guy called Yuan Chen :  " I cannot bear to put away the bamboo sleeping mat.
You aggrandize them . But you have intense energy.
Real dependence on this person.
You know , if you ' re just sleeping with somebody casually , you don ' t really care if they ' re sleeping with somebody else.
But the main characteristics of romantic love are craving : an intense craving to be with a particular person , not just sexually , but emotionally.
And last but not least , it is an obsession.
And indeed , they would say ,  " All day . All night . I can never stop thinking about him or her. " 
I would say ,  " Would you die for him or her ?  " 
So we scanned their brains , looking at a photograph of their sweetheart and looking at a neutral photograph , with a distraction task in between.
And indeed , that ' s exactly what happens.
The kind of mind -- part of the mind -- when you ' re reaching for that piece of chocolate , when you want to win that promotion at work.
But certainly , around the world , people who are rejected in love will kill for it.
I have come to think it ' s one of the most powerful brain systems on earth for both great joy and great sorrow.
It keeps bothering you a little bit , like being hungry.
You know , you can feel it when you ' re just driving along in your car.
So with that preamble , I want to go into discussing the two most profound social trends.
And everywhere in the world , 129 out of 130 of them , women are not only moving into the job market -- sometimes very , very slowly , but they are moving into the job market -- and they are very slowly closing that gap between men and women in terms of economic power , health and education.
And , indeed , that caravan is moving on.
They came home with 60 to 80 percent of the evening meal.
Then , women ' s worst invention was the plow.
We are seeing now one of the most remarkable traditions in the history of the human animal.
There ' s a lot of gender differences ; anybody who thinks men and women are alike simply never had a boy and a girl child.
But we did not evolve to have the same brain.
Women ' s ability to find the right word rapidly , basic articulation goes up in the middle of the menstrual cycle , when estrogen levels peak.
They held that baby in front of their face , cajoling it , reprimanding it , educating it with words.
We sit around it and it shapes our minds.
It ' s one of many , many characteristics that women have that they will bring into the job market.
They tend to be web thinkers.
They ' re both perfectly good ways of thinking.
When the male brain works well , it works extremely well.
I ' m always astonished when people come to me and say ,  " Why is it that men are so adulterous ?  " 
And -- basic math!
And , indeed , once again we ' re moving forward to the kind of sexual expression that we probably saw on the grasslands of Africa a million years ago , because this is the kind of sexual expression that we see in hunting and gathering societies today.
We ' re also seeing a rise of romantic love.
I even think that marriages might even become more stable because of the second great world trend.
So we ' re seeing there ' s a real extension of middle age.
It may decline some more.
However , there ' s always kinds of complications in this.
With orgasm you get a spike of dopamine.
But these three brain systems : lust , romantic love and attachment , aren ' t always connected to each other.
It ' s as if there ' s a committee meeting going on in your head as you are trying to decide what to do.
So I want to conclude with two things.
And these drugs are going generic.
I ' ve got nothing against people who take them short term , when they ' re going through something perfectly horrible.
And indeed , what these drugs do is raise levels of serotonin.
Not only do they suppress the dopamine circuit , but they kill the sex drive.
And when you tamper with one brain system , you ' re going to tamper with another.
I ' ve been studying romantic love and sex and attachment for 30 years.
I said ,  " I don ' t know anything about personality . You know ? 
That ' s my current project ; it will be my next book.
You fall in love with somebody who fits within what I call your  " love map, "  an unconscious list of traits that you build in childhood as you grow up.
I ' ve been carrying on here about the biology of love.
That ' s where we put our people in the MRI machine.
So he decided he ' d put science to work , and he invited this girl to go off on a rickshaw ride with him.
An hour later they get down off of the rickshaw , and she throws her hands up and she says ,  " Wasn ' t that wonderful ?  " 
These circuits are deeply embedded in the human brain.
cars,design,mobility,technology
And for most of those years , I worried about , how am I going to sell more cars and trucks ? 
I literally grew up with the Ford Motor Company.
They ' d sit down ; I ' d sneak out of the house.
So he and mom went to dinner , and I snuck out and thought it ' d be really cool to do donuts or even some figure-eights in the snow.
But I really began to love cars then.
My great grandfather was Henry Ford , and on my mother ' s side , my great grandfather was Harvey Firestone.
And that ' s a belief that I share.
And so even at a young age , that really resonated with me , and the whole notion of environmental preservation , at a very basic level , sunk in with me.
And when I got to college , you can imagine my surprise when I would go to class and a number of my professors would say that Ford Motor Company and my family was everything that was wrong with our country.
And as I look back over 30 years ago , it was a little naive to think at that age that I could . But I wanted to.
There were some within Ford who believed that all this ecological nonsense should just disappear and that I needed to stop hanging out with  " environmental wackos. " 
And in time , my views went from controversial to more or less consensus today.
And with new technology , we ' re reducing -- and I believe , someday we ' ll eliminate -- CO2 emissions.
But unfortunately , as we ' re on our way to solving one monstrous problem -- and as I said , we ' re not there yet ; we ' ve got a lot of work to do , but I can see where we will -- but even as we ' re in the process of doing that , another huge problem is looming , and people aren ' t noticing.
And at that population level , our planet will be dealing with the limits of growth.
But with more people and greater prosperity around the world , that number ' s going to grow to between two and four billion cars by mid century.
But that ' s nothing compared to what ' s going on in the nations that are growing the fastest.
So you can see the size of the issue that we ' re facing.
Well I think you probably already have the picture.
So what ' s going to solve this ? 
And to connect our country after World War II , we didn ' t build more two-lane highways , we built the interstate highway system.
We need an integrated system that uses real time data to optimize personal mobility on a massive scale without hassle or compromises for travelers.
And up above , you ' ve got a series of pedestrian walkways.
It ' s a system that really ties together all the transportation assets into a single payment system.
These are all really good ideas that will move us forward.
And every night I go home , my commute is a total crapshoot.
And these systems are being tested right now , and frankly they ' re going to be ready for prime time pretty soon.
Or think about being in New York City and tracking down an intelligent cab on your smart phone so you don ' t have to wait in the cold to hail one.
But as we found out with addressing CO2 issues , and also fossil fuels , there is no one silver bullet.
Companies , entrepreneurs , venture capitalists , they all need to understand this is a huge business opportunity , as well as an enormous social problem.
I mean , frankly , I need all of you to think about how you can help solve this huge issue.
But we need to get going , and we need to get going today.
And since then , the automobile has allowed us the freedom to choose where we live , where we work , where we play and frankly when we just go out and want to move around.
And it frankly will enhance our quality of life if we fix this.
So let ' s get started now.
43
And how do you bring those two things together ? 
I call this first chapter -- for the Brits in the room -- the  " Blinding Glimpse of the Bleeding Obvious. " 
And I think they were expecting -- they ' d worked with lots of consultants before -- I think they were expecting some kind of hideous org chart with thousands of bubbles and systemic this , that and the other , and all kinds of mappy stuff.
This is 59 seconds into the film.
5:10.
And the point is when you lie in a hospital bed all day , all you do is look at the roof , and it ' s a really shitty experience.
And they were sort , you know , blinding glimpse of bleeding obvious.
They said , OK , it ' s not about systemic change.
The first thing we did was we took a little bicycle mirror and we Band-Aided it here , onto a gurney , a hospital trolley , so that when you were wheeled around by a nurse or by a doctor , you could actually have a conversation with them.
The first thing they do is they decorated the ceiling.
Not particularly the world ' s best design solution for those of us who are real , sort of , hard-core designers , but nonetheless , a fabulous empathic solution for people.
So that what you could actually do was go into the room and write messages to the person who was sick in that room , which was lovely.
It ' s a history of invention based around this.
And he invented the shipping container.
Second one , without sounding overly Zen , and this is a quote from the Buddha :  " Finding yourself in the margins , looking to the edges of things , is often a really interesting place to start. " 
We were asked by a device producer -- we did the Palm Pilot and the Treo.
And they had this vision of the nurse , kind of , clicking away on this aluminum device and it all being incredibly , sort of , gadget-lustish.
So , the thing that we designed , much less sexy but much more human and practical , was this.
So , again , this idea of workarounds.
It ' s been all about these kind of thoughtless things that people do , which have huge intention and huge opportunity.
Why do we line up the square milk carton with the square fence ? 
Again , we ' re sort of using the world around us to create our own design solutions.
You can draw from this.
We co-opt other experiences -- we take one item and transfer it to another.
And there ' s almost this sort of semaphore around us all the time.
Third section is this idea of not knowing , of consciously putting yourself backwards.
This is the Billy bookcase -- it ' s IKEA ' s biggest selling product.
Children assume permission in a very different way.
So , what came out of this ? 
So , you know , it ' s a totally different way of looking at the situation.
And then use that information to fuel solutions ? 
I mean , it ' s about picking battles big enough to matter but small enough to win.
And , again , as designers , we wanted to make this thing incredibly beautiful and spend a lot of time thinking of the form.
We had to completely transfer ourselves over to their world.
It ' s turning these guys -- again , one of the themes -- it ' s turning them into entrepreneurs.
There it is , pumping water from 30 feet.
We feel that this is an important gesture.

Kiran Bir Sethi teaches kids to take charge
Inspiration is contagious.
In a country of a billion people and some , why so few ? 
I got infected when I was 17 , when , as a student of the design college , I encountered adults who actually believed in my ideas , challenged me and had lots of cups of chai with me.
And I uncovered that if learning is embedded in real-world context , that if you blur the boundaries between school and life , then children go through a journey of  " aware, "  where they can see the change ,  " enable, "  be changed , and then  " empower, "  lead the change.
So , I ' d like to show you a little glimpse of what common practice looks like at Riverside.
And in two hours , after their backs were broke , they were changed.
So , when Ragav experienced that he went from  " teacher told me, "  to  " I am doing it. "  And that ' s the  " I Can "  mindshift.
And we did . The data was conclusive.
Now it was not about Riverside school.
Basically , open your hearts and your minds to the child. " 
A glimpse of infection in Ahmedabad.
They are skating . They are doing street plays.
Kiran Bir Sethi : And the city will give free time.
So , you ' re getting the pattern . First 200 children at Riverside.
How ?  We designed a simple toolkit , converted it into eight languages , and reached 32,000 schools.
Children were designing solutions for a diverse range of problems.
Infection in India.
Look at what their parents says.
In the future , I will never doubt my students '  abilities.
We have to start collecting from 555.
Woman : It was a revelation for me . It doesn ' t strike me that they had so much inside them.
Girl : Are you ready ?  Audience : Yes!
It was incredible.
70 years ago , it took one man to infect an entire nation with the power of  " We can. " 
If not now , then when ? 
architecture,green,partner talk
The green agenda is probably the most important agenda and issue of the day.
But what I never said , and what I ' m really going to make the point is , that really , green is cool.
We reached a tipping point this year where living , acting , designing , investing and manufacturing green came to be understood by a critical mass of citizens , entrepreneurs and officials as the most patriotic , capitalistic , geo-political and competitive thing they could do.
And , in a way , it was Buckminster Fuller who coined that phrase.
And at that period it was -- in a way , a number of things were happening.
You can go back to his writings : it ' s quite extraordinary.
And this probably coincided with the time when you had the planet Earth ' s sourcebook , and you had the hippie movement.
People who were really design conscious were inspired by the work of Dieter Rams , and the objects that he would create for the company called Braun.
And I think that that digital revolution now is coming to the point where , as the virtual world , which brings so many people together here , finally connects with the physical world , there is the reality that that has become humanized , so that digital world has all the friendliness , all the immediacy , the orientation of the analog world.
And the reference to the iPod as iconic , and in a way evocative of performance , delivery -- quite interesting that [in] the beginning of the year 2007 , the Financial Times commented that the Detroit companies envy the halo effect that Toyota has gained from the Prius as the hybrid , energy-conscious vehicle , which rivals the iPod as an iconic product.
That would be the answer.
For example , if , in that Bucky-inspired phrase , we draw back and we look at planet Earth , and we take a kind of typical , industrialized society , then the energy consumed would be split between the buildings , 44 percent , transport , 34 percent , and industry.
For example , if you take , and you make a comparison between a recent kind of city , what I ' ll call , simplistically , a North American city -- and Detroit is not a bad example , it is very car dependent.
So basically , if you wanted to generalize , you can demonstrate that as the density increases along the bottom there , that the energy consumed reduces dramatically.
In the year 2000 , a rather interesting thing happened.
If you take China , and you just take Beijing , you can see on that traffic system , and the pollution associated with the consumption of energy as the cars expand at the price of the bicycles.
In other words , it is accelerating by a factor of 10.
And particularly , how can it lead to the creation of buildings which consume less energy , create less pollution and are more socially responsible ? 
In other words , for this community , they have this garden in the sky.
It has facilities like swimming pools , it has flextime , it has a social heart , a space , you have contact with nature.
And the people who ' d created it came back : the project managers , the company chairmen then.
This building was wired for change.
We were fortunate , because in a way our building was future-proofed.
In other words , we didn ' t have the technology to do what would be really interesting on that building.
The library of the Free University , which opened last year , is an example of that.
Again , coming back to that thing about the lifestyle , and in a way , the ecological agenda is very much at one with the spirit.
If I show another aspect of that technology then , in a completely different context -- this apartment building in the Alps in Switzerland.
And on the left are the cutting machines , which then , in the factory , enable those individual pieces to be fabricated and plus or minus very , very few millimeters , to be slotted together on site.
If I made the leap into these new technologies , then how did we -- what happened before that ? 
And in the absence of computers , you have to physically model.
And that was at the time that we sought to redesign , reinvent the airport.
And at that particular point in time , this was one of the few solitary computers.
It ' s not that long ago , 17 years , and here we are now.
That reaches 21 kilometers into the sky.
So it would be totally renewable.
A combination of biomass , aquifers , burning vegetable oil -- a process that , quite interestingly , was developed in Eastern Germany , at the time of its dependence on the Soviet Bloc.
I mean , a 94 percent reduction -- virtually clean.
There is an evolution here between the projects , and Swiss Re again develops that a little bit further -- the project in the city in London.
If , for example , you seek to do a building which goes right to the edge of the pavement , it ' s the same amount of space.
And here , if we look at a detail of the way that the building opens up and breathes into those atria , the way in which now , with a computer , we can model the forces , we can see the high pressure , the low pressure , the way in which the building behaves rather like an aircraft wing.
And the base of the building is again about public space.
The level is dropping , rather like the Aral Sea.
What if it is the equivalent , depending on where you are , of the Grand Canal , in terms of tourists , habitation , desalination , agriculture ? 
And whether that communication is the virtual world or it is the physical world , then it ' s absolutely central to society.
Hong Kong I refer to as a kind of analog experience in a digital age , because you always have a point of reference.
250 -- excuse me , 50,000 people working 24 hours , seven days.
As Hubert was talking over lunch , as we sort of engaged in conversation , talked about this , talked about cities.
The way in which somebody like Kennedy inspirationally could say ,  " We put a man on the moon. " 
And I voiced the thought that maybe at the turn of the year , I thought that the inspiration was more likely to come from those other , larger countries out there -- the Chinas , the Indias , the Asian-Pacific tigers.

The point that we have been stressing for the last 21 years , the point that people may be economically poor , but they ' re not poor in the mind.
Let me just tell you , briefly , my personal journey , which led me to come to this point.
I started looking at my own work : The work that I had done for the previous 10 years , almost every time , had instances of knowledge that people had shared.
Is it that I articulate very well ? 
You know , the public policy will become more responsive to the needs of the poor , and , therefore I think it ' s okay. " 
So what kind of a contributor was I ? 
So I did a review of ethical dilemma and value conflicts and management research , wrote , read about 100 papers.
And when it takes the nectar , the flowers don ' t feel shortchanged.
And I must tell you that after 20 years , I have not made one percent of change in the professional practice of this art.
We are talking about an accountable society , a society that is fair and just , and we don ' t even do justice in the knowledge market.
It must be the same.
Look at this picture.
Pardon ? 
Look at this . This is the site of the government of India.
It depends upon how you look at the life of the people.
And we do not ask this question.
Just do it 10 times ; you will realize the pain in this shoulder.
And every year , 99.9 percent of the paddy is transplanted manually.
Doing what ?  Breaking stones , digging earth.
And what has happened ? 
They could be creative in terms of education , they may be creative in terms of culture , they may be creative in terms of institutions ; but a lot of our work is in the field of technological creativity , the innovations , either in terms of contemporary innovations , or in terms of traditional knowledge.
And he said ,  " If my wish gets fulfilled "  -- somebody was sick and he had to monitor --  " God , please cure him.
There could be nothing more wrong than the Maslowian model of hierarchy of needs because the poorest people in this country can get enlightenment.
Look at this.
Now , this lady , on the wall of the dung cake heap , has made a painting.
Bhabi Mahato in Purulia and Bankura.
Obviously she ' s an artist ; she ' s a creative person.
In Motihari in Champaran , there are a lot of people who sell tea on the shack and , obviously , there ' s a limited market for tea.
People bring their own cooker , he attaches a valve and a steam pipe , and now he gives you espresso coffee.
So this fellow is bringing a flour-grinding machine on a two-wheeler.
They don ' t want second-standard , second-quality outputs.
If you have clothes , and you don ' t have enough time to wash them , he brought a washing machine to your doorstep , mounted on a two-wheeler.
Now , what we need is , we need people who will be able to scale them up.
It ' s a tawa.
This is less than a dollar and this is non-stick ; it is coated with one of these food-grade materials.
So it is better , it is safer ; it is affordable , it is energy-efficient.
He has designed this plate with a handle.
And who knows ?  Somebody will license this technology and develop marketable products , and she would get revenue.
So why are people willing to adjust with that mismatch ? 
It has 300 options , I ' m paying for 300 ; I ' m using only three but I ' m willing to live with it , therefore it is scaling up.
One of the greatest studies that we ' ve been finding is that many times investors would ask this question --  " What is a scalable model ?  "  -- as if the need of a community , which is only located in a space and time and has those needs only located in those places , has no legitimate right to get them for free because it ' s not part of a larger scale.
Look at what he is doing.
I had to meet my love.
New inventions are the passion of my life.
And we have not been able to convince the fire brigade people in Mumbai -- where there was a flood a few years ago and people had to walk 20 kilometers , wading in the water -- that , look , you should have this cycle in your fire brigade office because you can then go to those lanes where your buses will not go , where your transport will not go.
A very powerful message Appachan : I watch the world wake up every day.
My technology.
So , you know , we are advancing the frontiers of science.
Mr . Kharai who is a physically challenged person , one and a half foot height , only.
We were talking about , my friends in Brazil , how we scale up this model in China and Brazil.
But this innovation emerged in Brazil.
I can ' t change the condition of the road , but I can make the cycle run faster.
There ' s an axle here , of 30 , 40 kg , serving no purpose.
They were not related to her , but they tried to find out ,  " How can we use .. .  "  They used a cycle , they put together a breathing apparatus.
Assam , Kanak Gogoi.
This is what her son has done after seven years of struggle.
So , this is what SRISTI is saying :  " Give me a place to stand , and I will move the world. " 
These are the people whose knowledge made this Herbavate cream for eczema possible.
And incentives : not just material , but also non-material incentives.
1098
That was , of course , by Le Corbusier , the famous architect.
We have codes and standards that tell us that the lights should be so much lux and of great uniformity.
And the same is more or less what Santiago Calatrava said when he said ,  " Light : I make it in my buildings for comfort. " 
What it all boils down to is , of course , the sun.
So in an indirect way , you can see the sun.
They allowed themselves a few mistakes along the way.
It can be just like this , or maybe like this , which is rather peculiar , but this is in 1963 -- the viewing of a sun eclipse in the United States.
As opposed to the first office that I showed you in the beginning of the talk , this is a well-known office , which is the White Group.
So it can be very dim over there , and you do your work , and it can be very bright over there , and you do your work.
In the 1930s , Richard Kelly was the first person to really describe a methodology of modern lighting design.
Or something like this , which is the lighting design he did for General Motors , for the car showroom.
It could also be the sunlight that breaks through the clouds and lights up a patch of the land , highlighting it compared to the dim environment.
And I see it as a very comfortable kind of light that really helps us to relax and to contemplate.
And we can only create these out of darkness.
Those times , there were some early attempts also for light therapy already.
And there is the idea that , when we look at things , it is the yellow light that helps us the most , that we are the most sensitive for.
Maybe in the airplane , we can overcome jet lag like that.
So light is , of course , for social interaction also -- to create relationships with all the features around us.
And I think this is the most shocking image in my talk today.
It only spoils the darkness.
The world is changing though , and urbanization is a big driver of everything.
How do they share their culture ? 
It ' s not that long ago that our lighting was just done with these kinds of lamps.
And we can actually leave it out where it ' s not needed at all and where we can preserve darkness.
They created for me the biggest LED in the world especially for TEDx in Amsterdam.
So just to explain.
And the phosphor is excited by the blue and makes the light white and warm and pleasant.
We can go further.
Is it really needed ? 
Can we engage people more in the lighting projects that we create , so they really want to connect with it , like here ? 
And to find a starry sky like this is even more difficult.
They are not disturbed anymore.
I think , when I see it , I start to think , who are those people ? 
Edward Hopper was a real master in creating the narration by working with light and dark.
So I give you this wonderful , informative image of the sky , ranging from the inner city , where you may see one or two stars and nothing else , all the way to the rural environments , where you can enjoy this great and gorgeous and beautiful performance of the constellations and the stars.
But I also think of Peter Zumthor ' s spa in Vals , where light and dark , in very gentle combinations , alter each other to define the space.
It wouldn ' t be such an inspiring scenography without this theater.

This morning , the world ' s experts from I guess three or four different companies on building seats , I think concluded that ultimately , the solution is , people shouldn ' t sit down.
That ' s reassuring.
I would love to talk about the technology , and sometime , in what ' s past the 15 minutes , I ' ll be happy to talk to all the techno-geeks around here about what ' s in here.
And maybe to put that in perspective : there ' s so much data on this , I ' ll be happy to give it to you in different forms.
For instance , in that time , 91 percent of America lived either on farms or in small towns.
So the car was the clean environmental alternative to a horse and buggy.
And it is certainly a wonder.
That ' s 3.2 billion people.
Over the last hundred years , we started building cars , and then over the 50 years we ' ve connected every city to every other city in an extraordinarily efficient way , and we have a very high standard of living as a consequence of that.
And if you just look at how technology has been applied , we ' ve solved all the long-range , high-speed , high-volume , large-weight problems of moving things around.
The fact is , the last mile is the problem , and half the world now lives in dense cities.
And again , I say that not to attack any industry , I think -- I really do -- I love my airplane , and cars on highways moving 60 miles an hour are extraordinarily efficient , both from an engineering point of view , an energy consumption point of view , and a utility point of view.
If -- in China , in the year 1998 , 417 million people used bicycles ; 1.7 million people used cars.
So it seemed to me that somebody had to work on that last mile , and it was dumb luck . We were working on iBOTs , but once we made this , we instantly decided it could be a great alternative to jet skis . You don ' t need the water.
But rather than go license this off , which is what we normally do , it seemed to me that if we put all our effort not into the technology , but into an understanding of a world that ' s solved all its other problems , but has somehow come to accept that cities -- which , right back from ancient Greece on , were meant to walk around , cities that were architected and built for people -- now have a footprint that , while we ' ve solved every other transportation problem -- and it ' s like Moore ' s law.
They ' ve gotten bigger ; they ' re spread out.
So you wonder , what if cities could give to their pedestrians what we take for granted as we now go between cities ? 
Because technically I ' ve got motors ; I ' ve got wheels -- I ' m a motor vehicle.
I ' m a pedestrian . But the law typically lags technology by a generation or two , and if we get told we don ' t belong on the sidewalk , we have two choices.
And they belong on the sidewalks , and they ' ll use it seriously. " 
We went out and we found some visionary people with enough money to let us design and build these things , and in hopefully enough time to get them accepted.
One of the more exciting things that occurred to us about why it might get accepted , happened out here in California.
So I get off , and she gets on , and with a little bit of the usual , ah , then she turns around , and she goes about 20 feet , and she turns back around , and she ' s all smiles.
And the camera is down at her , and this guy has to put the microphone in her face , said ,  " What do you mean by that ?  " 
And it suddenly occurred to me , that among my many fears , were not just that the bureaucracy and the regulators and the legislators might not get it -- it was that , fundamentally , you believe there ' s pressure among the people not to invade the most precious little bit of space left , the sidewalks in these cities.
We ' ve got to show them this thing.
They learned to start with cell phones.
Cars were not meant for parallel parking ; they ' re wonderful machines to go between cities , but just think about it : we ' ve solved all the long-range , high-speed problems.
If this thing goes only three times as fast as walking -- three times -- a 30-minute walk becomes 10 minutes.
We could change the way people allocate their resources , the way this planet uses its energy , make it more fun.
Yes , it could be attached to this , and yes , on a kilogram of propane , you could drive from New York to Boston if you so choose.
It makes just enough electricity to , for instance , do this , which at night is enough electricity , in the rest of the world , as Mr . Holly -- Dr . Holly -- pointed out , can run computers and a light bulb.
That ' s so much energy , you couldn ' t afford to desalinate or clean water in this country that way.
We don ' t need sophisticated heart transplants around the world.
So if we put this box on here in a few years , could we have a solution to transportation , electricity , and communication , and maybe drinkable water in a sustainable package that weighs 60 pounds ? 
Animal fan Nellie McKay sings a sparkling tribute to her dear dog . She suggests we all do the same :  " Just go right to the pound/ And find yourself a hound/ And make that doggie proud/  ' cause that ' s what it ' s all about. " 
I’d like to dedicate this next song to Carmelo , who was put to sleep a couple of days ago , because he got too old.
Chris Anderson , the editor of <em>WIRED</em> , explores the four key stages of any viable technology : setting the right price , gaining market share , displacing an established technology and , finally , becoming ubiquitous.
I ' d like to speak about technology trends , which is something that many of you follow -- but we also follow , for related reasons.
We also , like a lot of companies , create a product that ' s based on technology trends.
Almost every one of those has come true just a few years later.
And just for fun , we put a bunch of technologies on it , to show whether they were kind of rising for the first high peak , or whether they were about to crash into the trough of disillusionment , or rise back in the slope of enlightenment , etc.
You can see in 1997 , we put Linux on the cover.
I ' d like to talk about a way of thinking about technology trends that I call my  " grand unified theory of predicting the future, "  but it ' s closer to a petite unified theory of predicting the future.
The first is the critical price.
And then finally , a lot of technologies commoditize.
I ' d like to demonstrate what I mean by this by telling the story of the DVD , which is a technology which has done all of these.
And what ' s interesting here is that something else took off along with it : home-theater units.
Reed Hastings is here . He clearly saw that that was a moment , that was an inflection point that he could do something with.
Netflix was right -- the Netflix model could capitalize on the DVD in a way that the video-rental stores couldn ' t.
There ' s a company called Apex , a no-name Chinese firm , who has , several times in the past year , been the number-one DVD seller in America . Their average price , for last year , was 48 dollars.
Now they ' ve introduced these four ways of looking at technology , these four stages of technology ' s life.
Start with gene sequencing.
You know , our ability to capture the tools of creation is getting closer and closer.
Here ' s another technology that ' s approaching a critical price.
Today it ' s less than 50 cents a day.
Now we ' ve switched to critical mass.
The crossover that ' s going to matter is the one with the blue.
Another technology that we see all around us out here is hybrid cars.
At two percent , you start seeing them on the roads everywhere.
You can have regenerative braking ; you can have drive-by-wire ; you can have replaceable body shapes -- it ' s a little thing that starts with a hybrid , but it can lead to a whole new era of the car.
Look at these numbers . They launched it in August of last year ; they already have nearly four million registered users -- that ' s critical mass.
And finally , free . Free is really , really interesting.
It ' s a deflationary force , if not handled right.
You know , there could be a film ' s [unclear] there , but it ' s basically , every song ever made could be stored on 400 dollars worth of storage by 2008 . It takes that entire element , the physical element , of songs off the table.
And their response is draconian , and not necessarily the one that ' s going to get them out of this.
India had , still has , a regulated phone system and so did we.
It is probably one of the most dramatic shifts in globalization and one of the most powerful economic tools that we ' re seeing in our world today.
The debate over foreign aid often pits those who mistrust  " charity "  against those who mistrust reliance on the markets . Jacqueline Novogratz proposes a middle way she calls patient capital , with promising examples of entrepreneurial innovation driving social change.
Clearly , we ' re living in a moment of crisis.
And we ' ve got a president who sees himself as a global citizen , who recognizes that no longer is there a single superpower , but that we ' ve got to engage in a different way with the world.
Today there is a raging debate as to how best we lift people out of poverty , how best we release their energies.
We call it patient capital.
On the other side , as I said , there are those who say the problem is that we need more money.
And the problem is that neither side is listening to the other.
And so we need both the market and we need aid.
It recognizes that the market has its limitation , and so patient capital also works with smart subsidy to extend the benefits of a global economy to include all people.
Third , they are often creating markets.
Not only to build the systems , the business models that allow us to reach low income people in a sustainable way , but to connect those business to other markets , to governments , to corporations -- real partnerships if we want to get to scale.
They were creating subsidies either for large farms , or they were giving inputs to the farmers that they thought they should use , rather than that the farmers wanted to use.
But the market also had bypassed low income farmers , because these systems were both too expensive , and they were constructed for fields that were too large.
The first one was miniaturization.
And third , it had to be what Amitabha calls infinitely expandable.
And so we needed grants . And he used significant grants to research , to experiment , to fail , to innovate and try again.
And so we met Dr . Sono Khangharani in Pakistan.
We ' re starting to see these happening all around the world.
And 1298 Ambulances decided that it was going to reinvent a completely broken industry , building an ambulance service in Bombay that would use the technology of Google Earth , a sliding scale pricing system so that all people could have access , and a severe and public decision not to engage in any form of corruption.
Because we ' re starting to see these enterprises reach hundreds of thousands of people . All of the ones I discussed have reached at least a quarter million people.
President Obama understands that.
And then measure the returns , both from a financial perspective and from a social impact perspective.
And if we take that notion of a global innovation fund , we could use this time to invest not directly in government , though we would have government ' s blessing , nor in international experts , but in the many existing entrepreneurs and civil society leaders who already are building wonderful innovations that are reaching people all across the country.
It ' s not hyperbole to say that these civil society institutions and these social entrepreneurs are building real alternatives to the Taliban.
That these social leaders who really are looking at innovation and extending opportunity to the 70 percent of Pakistanis who make less than two dollars a day , provide real pathways to hope.
It was about 115 degrees.
That there in the desert was a field of sunflowers growing seven feet tall.
Because he was building these crops.
And he said ,  " Of course I will.
And what ' s exciting is to see so many entrepreneurs across sectors who are building innovations that recognize that what people want is freedom and choice and opportunity.
But I think our generation also might be the first to have the courage to embrace both love and power.
Not only to inspire innovation and risk taking , but to truly build systems that have created more than 25,000 jobs and delivered tens of millions of services and products to some of the poorest people on the planet.
Rather than what we think that they might need.
And there is so much good that we can do.

Children with cleft palates will get it , and they document their story . This is wonderful.
And -- the short story about my blog : it started in 2001 . I was 23.
They sent a search party , and I overheard people saying they wish I had killed myself , jumped off Bible Peak.
And when I started my blog it was really this one goal -- I said , I am not going to be famous to the world , but I could be famous to people on the Internet.
And then I wrote a post about a banjo.
And my husband -- this is my husband , who is very hot -- he won an award for being hot -- -- he told me ,  " You cannot buy a banjo.
This is Mena , this is how I make a joke at people.
But I got emails from people that said ,  " Oh my God , your husband is such an asshole.
I ' ve been with him since I was 17 years old . We ' ve never had a separate bank account.
And why are they reading this ?  " 
I ' m like , I don ' t want to write this anymore , and I slowly and slowly -- And I did tell personal stories from time to then.
But anyways.

So , blogs.
It ' s this record of who you are , your persona.
And we talk about the world flattens as being this panel , and I am very optimistic.
But to see something like the $100 computer is amazing , because it ' s a -- blogging software is simple.
We started with a slide of my Teds , and I had to add this slide , because I knew that the minute I showed this , my mom -- my mom will see this deck somehow , because she does read my blog -- and she ' ll say ,  " Why wasn ' t there a picture of me ?  " 
I would spend hours looking at just the connections , saying ,  " Oh , the little kid up at the top has red hair ; so does that first generation up there. " 
I have this record , this 1910 census of another Grabowski -- that ' s my maiden name -- and there ' s a Theodore , because there ' s always a Theodore.
And just doing this I spent time in the archives -- that ' s another thing why my husband ' s a saint -- I spent time in the Washington archives , just sitting there , looking for these things . Now it ' s online , but he sat through that.
And he ' s basically taking a picture of his family everyday for the past , what is  ' 76 -- 20 , oh my God , I ' m  ' 77 -- 29 years ?  Twenty-nine years.
I know that one day my children will be wondering -- or my grandchildren , or my great-grandchildren , if I ever have children -- what I am going to -- who I was , so I do something that ' s very narcissistic : I am a blogger -- that is an amazing thing for me , because it captures a moment in time everyday.
About four people probably read it , and they tell me , you know ,  " You haven ' t updated "  -- I ' m probably going to get people telling me I haven ' t updated -- but this is something that ' s amazing , because I can go back to a day -- I can go back to April 2005 , and say , what was I doing this day ?  I look at it , I know exactly.
I was sick , and I was in a hotel room , and I wanted not to be there . And so you see these things.

And her sister came on , and she said that Emma had passed away . And all of our support staff who had talked to her were really emotional , and it was a very hard day at the company.
And that was amazing -- to be able to know that we had empowered that , and that blogging was something that she felt comfortable doing , and that the idea that blogging doesn ' t have to be scary , that we don ' t always have to be attack of the blogs , that we can be people who are open , and wanting to help and talk to people.
So , this is her legacy , and I think that my call to action to all of you is : you know , think about blogs , think about what they are , think about what you ' ve thought of them , and then actually do it , because it ' s something that is really going to change our lives.
mission blue,oceans,science,technology
Bluefin are warmblooded like us.
You can see in its shape and its streamlined design it ' s powered for ocean swimming.
Now , bluefin were revered by Man for all of human history.
This fish was revered by humankind.
And yet , the type of fishing going on today , with pens , with enormous stakes , is really wiping bluefin ecologically off the planet.
And that ' s their problem ; we ' re eating them to death.
The European population and North African -- the Eastern bluefin tuna -- is fished at tremendous levels : 50,000 tons over the last decade almost every year.
They were voted on and rejected just two weeks ago , despite outstanding science that shows from two committees this fish meets the criteria of CITES I.
I doubt anyone has seen a giant bluefin feed.
And we ' ve got to use these technologies immediately to get a better understanding of how our ocean realm works.
We can ' t see the corridors , and we can ' t see what it is that brings together a tuna , a leatherback and an albatross.
It ' s really tough to get up close and personal with a mako shark and try to put a tag on it.
We ' re putting them together in unusual ways , and this is taking us into the ocean realm like never before.
We ' ve actually taken a sliver of the ocean , put it behind glass , and we together have put bluefin tuna and yellowfin tuna on display.
And we can bring two million people a year into contact with this fish and show them its beauty.
What do they like to eat ? 
Jeff and Jason there , are scientists who are going to take a tuna and put it in the equivalent of a treadmill , a flume.
And when I see that tuna -- this is my favorite view -- I begin to wonder : how did this fish solve the longitude problem before we did ? 
So in a program called Tag-A-Giant we ' ve actually gone from Ireland to Canada , from Corsica to Spain.
It ' s a very hard process , but it ' s a ballet.
And then with a lot of effort , after tagging , putting in the computer , making sure the stalk is sticking out so it senses the environment , we send this fish back into the sea.
Now sometimes the tunas are really large , such as this fish off Nantucket.
This tag rides on the tuna , senses the environment around the tuna and actually will come off the fish , detach , float to the surface and send back to Earth-orbiting satellites position data estimated by math on the tag , pressure data and temperature data.
They are some of our finest instruments , our new technology in the ocean today.
In this case , we ' re actually going to measure the fish.
And this is my favorite.
That ' s where the tuna wants to go -- it wants to forage on schools of herring -- but it can ' t get there . It ' s too cold.
Astronomically , we ' re calculating positions.
And now we ' re showing that tunas on the western side go to the eastern side.
And so what we ' ve done with the science is we ' re showing the International Commission , building new models , showing them that a two-stock no-mixing model -- to this day , used to reject the CITES treaty -- that model isn ' t the right model.
These become forthright in places we need to protect.
Now in a second project called Tagging of Pacific Pelagics , we took on the planet as a team , those of us in the Census of Marine Life.
And that shark leaping there , if you look carefully , has an antenna.
Salmon sharks go down to the tropics to pup and come into Monterey.
And we ' ll wind in the target.
We also tag makos with our NOAA colleagues , blue sharks.
The tuna team from TOPP has done the unthinkable : three teams tagged 1,700 tunas , bluefin , yellowfin and albacore all at the same time -- carefully rehearsed tagging programs in which we go out , pick up juvenile tunas , put in the tags that actually have the sensors , stick out the tuna and then let them go.
And then there ' s Scott Shaffer and our shearwaters wearing tuna tags , light-based tags , that now are going to take you from New Zealand to Monterey and back , journeys of 35,000 nautical miles we had never seen before.
Then there ' s George Schillinger and our leatherback team out of Playa Grande tagging leatherbacks that go right past where we are.
And from this information , we can begin to map the hope spots.
And then for sort of an encore from these animals , they ' re helping us.
This data , when visualized , is captivating to watch.
And now with Google ' s Oceans , we can actually put a white shark in that ocean.
We just need to put it together.
How is it that we can actually take this type of activity elsewhere ? 
Let ' s connect the public to this activity right on their iPhone.
We have the science and technology.
After he ended up on a watch list by accident , Hasan Elahi was advised by his local FBI agents to let them know when he was traveling . He did that and more .. . much more.
Hi there . I ' m Hasan . I ' m an artist.
So what I ' m really interested in is creative problem solving.
And this is the Detroit airport in June 19th of 2002.
And then literally just out of nowhere , the guy asks me ,  " Where were you September 12th ?  " 
I had September 12th -- from 10:00 a.m . to 10:30 a.m. , I paid my storage bill.
 " Where were you the 29th ?  the 30th ?  " 
But good thing I did , because I don ' t look good in orange.
Just assorted garage sale junk , because I ' m a pack rat. " 
And he ' s still a little confused , but I think that anyone who talks to me for more than a couple of minutes realizes I ' m not exactly a terrorist threat.
I was like ,  " Great. " 
So to the folks from Google , thank you.
You ' re basically face-to-face with someone that essentially decides life or death.
Because you have to base it on a yes or no.
But they said ,  " Okay , aside from what we had discussed , do you belong to any groups that wish to harm the United States ?  " 
I know everything ' s fine. " 
And I was like ,  " All we need is Alaska not to get the last memo , and here we go all over again. " 
I would tell them ,  " Hey guys , this is where I ' m going . This is my flight.
Just wanted to say ,  " Hey guys.
And so I just kept doing this over and over and over.
And then I built this over here . Let me go back to it over here.
Basically , what I decided is okay guys , you want to watch me , that ' s cool.
So in the process , I start thinking , well what else might they know about me ? 
This was on Delta 719 going from JFK to San Francisco.
This is in Warsaw.
And when you ' re in a situation where you have to justify every moment of your existence , you ' re put in the situation where you react in a very different manner.
And after piecing together this , this and this , this way of actually trying to figure out what happened for myself eventually evolved into this , and it actually became this project.
And I bought some crabs too right around there , and some chitlins at the Safeway in Emoryville.
So not only that I ' m giving this information here and there , but now there ' s a third party , an independent third party , my bank , that ' s verifying that , yes indeed , I was there at this time.
So 34 cents foreign transaction fee.
And then sometimes you get this.
I spend a lot of time on the road.
And there ' s thousands and thousands and thousands of images.
So you get something like this.
So how do you know these are meals eaten at home ? 
These are all tacos eaten in Mexico City near a train station on July fifth to July sixth.
Every few moments I shoot the image.
And on Sunday , June 14th at 2009 -- this was actually about two o ' clock in the afternoon in Skowhegan , Maine -- this was my apartment there.
It ' s actually quite user-unfriendly.
And you know very little about me actually.
And if I give you this information directly , it ' s a very different type of identity than if you were to try to go through and try to get bits and pieces.
And I understand that , on an individual level , it ' s purely symbolic.
And we ' re getting to that.
So in a way , I ' m glad that I ' m completely obsolete.
And you know , some of my friends have always said ,  " Hey , you ' re just paranoid . Why are you doing this ? 
Because it ' s about surveillance.
And just little bits and pieces , and you can see some of the things there.
I actually moved very close to them . I live right down the street from them now.
I think they kind of like to look at art.
You said ,  " Now everything automatically goes from my iPhone, "  but actually you do take the pictures and put on information.
It ' s no different than checking an email.
So it ' s really just a matter of my phone clicking a couple of clicks , send , and then it ' s done.
So it holds onto the very last point.
We feel instinctively that societies with huge income gaps are somehow going wrong . Richard Wilkinson charts the hard data on economic inequality , and shows what gets worse when rich and poor are too far apart : real effects on health , lifespan , even such basic values as trust.
You all know the truth of what I ' m going to say.
But first , see what a miserable lot we are.
And it makes no difference to their life expectancy at all.
These are small areas of England and Wales -- the poorest on the right , the richest on the left.
The explanation of that paradox is that , within our societies , we ' re looking at relative income or social position , social status -- where we are in relation to each other and the size of the gaps between us.
I ' m taking data from the U.N . -- it ' s the same as the World Bank has -- on the scale of income differences in these rich developed market democracies.
On that measure , we are twice as unequal as some of the other successful market democracies.
We put them all in one index.
The more unequal countries are doing worse on all these kinds of social problems.
It has 40 different components put together by other people.
Kids do worse in the more unequal societies.
The average well-being of our societies is not dependent any longer on national income and economic growth.
Here , for instance , is trust.
But in the more equal societies , it rises to 60 or 65 percent.
So here is trust from a general social survey of the federal government related to inequality.
We ' re not just talking about a fluke.
And it goes from about eight percent up to three times that -- whole societies with three times the level of mental illness of others.
But look at the scale of the differences.
But it goes from about 40 to 400 people in prison.
And the more unequal societies are more likely also to retain the death penalty.
This is social mobility.
And in Scandinavian countries , fathers '  income is much less important.
I could have shown a number of other problems.
I want to go back though to this graph that I showed you earlier where we put it all together to make two points.
The other really important point I want to make on this graph is that , if you look at the bottom , Sweden and Japan , they ' re very different countries in all sorts of ways.
Japan is rather different though.
And in our analysis of the American states , we find rather the same contrast.
Another really surprising part of this picture is that it ' s not just the poor who are affected by inequality.
It ' s infant mortality.
It goes through towards the skilled manual occupations in the middle , then the junior non-manual , going up high to the professional occupations -- doctors , lawyers , directors of larger companies.
We show that on about five different sets of data covering educational outcomes and health in the United States and internationally.
More to do with feelings of superiority and inferiority , of being valued and devalued , respected and disrespected.
The social-evaluative judgments increase , the fear of those social-evaluative judgments.
Those kind of stresses have a very particular effect on the physiology of stress.
We have an absolute rule that if our data source has data for one of the countries we ' re looking at , it goes into the analysis.
There are 200 studies of health in relation to income and equality in the academic peer-reviewed journals.
Well we ' ve shown you that GNP per capita doesn ' t make any difference.
We spend a good bit of time.
I should say that to deal with this , we ' ve got to deal with the post-tax things and the pre-tax things.
Suddenly we have a handle on the psychosocial well-being of whole societies , and that ' s exciting.
1624
He ' d spent 10,000 dollars to buy a website that exclusively featured women having sex on top of or inside of luxury sports cars.
But they didn ' t spend a lot of time reliving the glory days.
You ' ve got to pay for your soap , your deodorant , toothbrush , toothpaste , all of it.
So how do you survive ? 
You charge another inmate to clean his cell.
You want a cigarette in prison ?  Three to five dollars.
So as you can probably tell , one of the defining aspects of prison life is ingenuity.
So none of us should be surprised that two out of three ex-offenders re-offend within five years.
The best thing we can do is figure out ways to nurture the entrepreneurial spirit and the tremendous untapped potential in our prisons , because if we don ' t , they ' re not going to learn any new skills that ' s going to help them , and they ' ll be right back.
creativity,design,happiness
Yeah , people used to say ,  " Norman ' s OK , but if you followed what he said , everything would be usable but it would be ugly. " 
I mean , it ' s just wonderful.
The new me is all about making things kind of neat and fun.
The acid will ruin the gold plating.
First of all , look at the shape -- it ' s just wonderful to look at.
And so it ' s got everything , right ? 
Hiroshi Ishii and his group at the MIT Media Lab took a ping-pong table and placed a projector above it , and on the ping-pong table they projected an image of water with fish swimming in it.
No . But is it fun ? 
So Google just took their logo and they spread it out.
I bet a lot of you have seen it and never noticed it.
Now , the weird thing is Google lies , because if I type  " design and emotion, "  it says ,  " You don ' t need the  ' and. '  We do it anyway. " 
Oh well , different story.
It ' s so much fun to drive. " 
So that ' s my new life ; it ' s all about fun.
No problem.
So , Paul Saffo , before his talk said that he didn ' t really have it down until just a few days or hours before the talk , and that anxiety was really helpful in causing him to focus.
But it really changes the way you think.
It was an empty room , except for a table with a bunch of crap on it -- some papers and scissors and stuff.
Still can ' t reach it.
And turns out they liked it , and it made them happy -- not very happy , but a little bit of happy.
That ' s what brainstorming is about , right ? 
You ' ve got be anxious.
There ' s something I call the visceral level of processing , and there will be visceral-level design.
We dislike bitter tastes , we dislike loud sounds , we dislike hot temperatures , cold temperatures.
Or the 1963 Jaguar : It ' s actually a crummy car , falls apart all the time , but the owners love it.
They keep it for -- you know , it ' s like the old wine bottles , you keep it for decoration or maybe fill it with water again , which proves it ' s not the water.
Behavioral is subconscious , you ' re unaware of it.
Most of what we do is subconscious.
They ' re so nicely balanced , so sharp , that you really feel you ' re in control of the cutting.
It will squirt you all around and you can stay in that shower for hours -- and not waste water , by the way , because it recirculates the same dirty water.
The water then seeps over the tea.
And that means the tea is partially covered while it completes the brewing.
It ' s being safe in the world.
And the waiter can come by and say ,  " Would you like more water ?  " 
It ' s that little voice in your head that ' s watching and saying ,  " That ' s good . That ' s bad. " 
Owners of the Hummer have said ,  " You know I ' ve owned many cars in my life -- all sorts of exotic cars , but never have I had a car that attracted so much attention. " 
And you ' ll buy it to protect the environment , even though the first few cars are going to be really expensive and not perfected.
But it ' s ugly.
So , it ' s pitting one against the other.
And what ' s so neat about it is how you accept that story.

Sugata Mitra shows how kids teach themselves
And if I succeed in doing that , maybe you would go back with the thought that you could build on , and perhaps help me do my work.
What happens to education ? 
We made a guess . The guess was that schools in remote areas do not have good enough teachers.
But I wanted to check if this is true . So what I did last year was we hired a car , looked up on Google , found a route into northern India from New Delhi which , you know , which did not cross any big cities or any big metropolitan centers . Drove out about 300 kilometers , and wherever we found a school , administered a set of standard tests , and then took those test results and plotted them on a graph.
That seemed a little damning , and I tried to correlate it with things like infrastructure , or with the availability of electricity , and things like that.
It did not correlate with the poverty levels . It did not correlate.
When you take education and technology , then I find in the literature that , you know , things like websites , collaborative environments -- you ' ve been listening to all that in the morning -- it ' s always piloted first in the best schools , the best urban schools , and , according to me , biases the result.
You put in this new super-duper technology , and now they get 83 percent.
So I came to this conclusion that ET should reach the underprivileged first , not the other way about.
He said a teacher than can be replaced by a machine , should be.
So far I haven ' t come across such an area , except for one case . I won ' t name the area , but somewhere in the world people said , we don ' t have this problem , because we have perfect teachers and perfect schools.
I ' ll have to really rush through this . They ' re a set of experiments.
They cut a hole inside that wall -- which is how it has got the name hole-in-the-wall -- and put a pretty powerful PC into that hole , sort of embedded into the wall so that its monitor was sticking out at the other end , a touchpad similarly embedded into the wall , put it on high-speed Internet , put the Internet Explorer there , put it on Altavista.com -- in those days -- and just left it there.
To the right is this eight-year-old child who -- and to his left is a six-year-old girl , who is not very tall.
Will the computer last , or will they break it and steal it -- and did anyone teach them ? 
He came there and he started to fiddle around with the touchpad.
He did that , and the Internet Explorer changed page.
So eight minutes and an embedded computer seemed to be all that we needed there.
So I said , have what , shall I translate the Internet into some Indian language ?  That ' s not possible.
And I built a similar hole-in-the-wall.
So when I came back there , I found these two kids , eight- and 12-year-olds , who were playing a game on the computer.
And they said ,  " Well , we ' ve picked it up from the CDs. " 
So , Madantusi seemed to show that language is not a barrier ; in fact they may be able to teach themselves the language if they really wanted to.
So I did this for almost five years , and this experiment really took us all the way across the length and breadth of India.
And you see here a little clip of -- one of these villages -- the first thing that these children did was to find a website to teach themselves the English alphabet.
This sequence is also nice . This is a small child , a six-year-old , telling his eldest sister what to do.
I couldn ' t find a single correlation with anything , but it had to be in groups.
We took standard statistical techniques , so I ' m going to not talk about that.
Basic Windows functions , browsing , painting , chatting and email , games and educational material , music downloads , playing video.
If you calculated the actual time of access , it would work out to minutes per day , so that ' s not how it ' s happening.
Around these four are usually a group of about 16 children , who are also advising , usually wrongly , about everything that ' s going on on the computer.
So what does the eight-year-old do ? 
So what was the conclusion over the six years of work ? 
The third piece was on values , and again , to put it very briefly , I conducted a test over 500 children spread across all over India , and asked them -- I gave them about 68 different values-oriented questions and simply asked them their opinions.
A typical example being ,  " Sometimes it is necessary to tell lies. " 
Finally , self-organizing systems , about which , again , I won ' t say too much because you ' ve been hearing all about it.
And you know about the Internet-based self-organizing systems.
Values are acquired ; doctrine and dogma are imposed -- the two opposing mechanisms.
As educationists , we have never asked for technology ; we keep borrowing it.
And such a set of specs should produce the technology to address remoteness , values and violence.
http://www.ted.com/talks/carne_ross_an_independent_diplomat.html
Carne Ross : An independent diplomat
And it ' s about rediscovering idealism in all of that wreckage.
I believe in randomness , and one of the reasons I believe that is because me becoming a diplomat was random.
And I ' d always wanted to be a fighter pilot when I was a boy.
I couldn ' t see all the blinking different lights , and I can ' t distinguish color.
in Angola or Afghanistan.
And he turned to me , and he said ,  " Carne , you have to be very clever to be a diplomat. " 
And as those numbers suggest , I was inducted into an elite and fascinating and exhilarating world.
I headed the Middle East Peace Process section in the British Foreign Ministry.
Later , I traveled to Kabul and served in Afghanistan after the fall of the Taliban.
And it ' s a great cadre of people , incredibly close-knit community of people.
And there , I dealt with things like the Middle East peace process , the Lockerbie issue -- we can talk about that later , if you wish -- but above all , my responsibility was Iraq and its weapons of mass destruction and the sanctions we placed on Iraq to oblige it to disarm itself of these weapons.
We went through several wars during my time in New York.
Although I worked very long hours , I lived in a penthouse in Union Square.
I decided to take a sabbatical , in fact , at the New School , Bruce.
The Foreign Office was very generous.
And two things happened in Kosovo , which kind of , again , shows the randomness of life , because these things turned out to be two of the pivots of my life and helped to deliver me to the next stage.
I had been steeped in the intelligence on Iraq and its WMD , and my testimony to the inquiry said three things : that the government exaggerated the intelligence , which was very clear in all the years I ' d read it.
But anyway , I gave that testimony , and that presented me with a crisis.
And this wasn ' t a pretty thing.
I felt just something ' s broken.
And I started to fall.
A second thing happened in Kosovo , which kind of -- I need a quick gulp of water , forgive me.
A lot of my friends were still in it.
And that year , in Kosovo , this terrible , terrible thing happened , which I saw.
And it ' s a very horrible thing to see anarchy , to know that the police and the military -- there were lots of military troops there -- actually can ' t stop that rampaging mob who ' s coming down the street.
And with my Albanian friends , we tried to stop it , but we failed.
There was this whole fancy diplomatic system , this negotiation process about the future of Kosovo , and the Kosovars weren ' t part of it.
It was a complicated thing , and I ' m not pretending it was more simple than it was.
Why don ' t you advise their government on their diplomacy ?  " 
And so that was the idea.
I know this stuff . It ' s what I do . Why don ' t I come and help you ?  " 
And Kosovo became independent.
We ' re advising the Polisario Front of the Western Sahara , who are fighting to get their country back from Moroccan occupation after 34 years of dispossession.
At that time there was just me -- and me and my wife were moving back to New York.
And watching  ? What If!
We all sit in one office and shout at each other across the office.
There are , I don ' t know , some lessons from all of this , personal and political -- and in a way , they ' re the same thing.
Independent Diplomat is part of a trend which is emerging and evident across the world , which is that the world is fragmenting.
They may be corporations , they may be mafiosi , they may be nice NGOs , they may anything , any number of things.
If they can ' t do it , who ' s left to deal with it ? 
Ask me how later , particularly if you eat fish , interestingly enough , but that connection is there.
And Independent Diplomat is a kind of example of this in a sort of loose way.
Today , 80 percent of the agenda of the U.N . Security Council is about conflicts within states , involving non-state parties -- guerillas , separatists , terrorists , if you want to call them that , people who are not normal governments , who are not normal states.
So I started off in a traditional mode.
You ' ve got to institutionalize a system where you actually invite the Kosovars to come and tell you what they think.
Super-logical , you would think.
And of course , nothing happened -- nobody did anything.
So what we ' re going to do is we ' re actually going to set up these meetings ourselves.
So there ' s actually a conversation , which has never before happened.
Preach technology to all the Twittering members of all the Iranian demonstrations who are now in political prison in Tehran , where Ahmadinejad remains in power.
That ' s my story . Thanks.
1655
I ' m so excited , I ' m pouring myself into my lesson plans.
There ' s silence.
These sympathetic smiles spread all throughout the room now , and I realize that all of my other students are in the same boat , that maybe they took notes or they memorized definitions from the textbook , but not one of them really understood the main ideas.
So the only thing I can think of is say ,  " Listen . Let me tell you a story.
But what a lot of people don ' t know is that viruses can also make bacteria sick. " 
Maybe he ' s floating around in your stomach or in some spoiled food somewhere , and all of a sudden he starts to not feel so good.
But if you ' re a virus and you see this , you cross those little legs of yours and you think ,  " We rock. " 
The next thing is , that virus DNA made stuff that chopped up the bacteria DNA.
The workers still come the next day , they do their job , but they ' re following different instructions.
When a secret agent virus infects a bacterium , they do a little espionage.
So now we have a whole extended bacteria family , filled with virus sleeper cells.
There are two ways : On the left is what we call the lytic way , where the viruses go right in and take over the cells.
But if you ' ve graduated from high school , I can almost guarantee you ' ve seen this information before.
First of all , I can guarantee you that their textbooks didn ' t have secret agent viruses , and they didn ' t have horror stories.
Right ?  I mean , because God forbid somebody have fun when they ' re learning science.
Now another problem was that the language in their textbook was truly incomprehensible.
But here ' s the thing . There are plenty of people in science education who would look at this and say there ' s no way that we could ever give that to students , because it contains some language that isn ' t completely accurate.
So a professional science writer would circle that and say ,  " That has to go.
This is horrifying.
What is the point ?  " 
And you ' re like ,  " Actually , shut up!
But just as important is knowing which details we should leave out so that the main point still comes across.
That ' s not true at all.
This needs to stop , and I wish that the change could come from the institutions at the top that are perpetuating these problems , and I beg them , I beseech them to just stop it.
I dream of a Wikipedia-like website that would explain any scientific concept you can think of in simple language any middle schooler can understand.
There ' s still so much work left to be done , though , and if you ' re involved with science in any way I urge you to join me.
How should you start ? 
culture,entertainment
So most everyone watches TV.
Okay ? 
They call it stupid , and worse , believe me.
So all these things are uniquely human , and they all add up to our idea of conscience.
How do these Nielsen ratings reflect not just what you ' ve heard about , which is the idea of our social , collective unconscious , but how do these top-10 Nielsen-rated shows over 50 years reflect the idea of our social conscience ? 
As humans , what ' s important to remember is that we ' ve developed , we ' ve evolved over time to temper , or tame , these basic animal instincts.
The other thing about human beings is that we love to be entertained.
So I had an ambition to discover what could be understood from this uniquely human relationship between television programs and the human conscious.
So to begin to answer these questions , we did a research study.
How did you feel watching every single one of these shows ? 
So to our global TED audiences , I want to say that this was a U.S . sample.
Two acknowledgments before our first data slide : For inspiring me to even think about the idea of conscience and the tricks that conscience can play on us on a daily basis , I thank legendary rabbi , Jack Stern.
Two things we ' re going to start with -- the inspiration state and the moral ambiguity state , which , for this purpose , we defined inspiration as television shows that uplift me , that make me feel much more positive about the world.
Moral ambiguity starts to climb.
In 1970 , inspiration plummets.
But look , it can ' t : AIDS , Iran-Contra , the Challenger disaster , Chernobyl.
But in this case , we have comfort -- the bubble in red -- social commentary and irreverence in blue and green.
Social commentary is all of a sudden spiking up.
The socially irreverent hippie show ,  " Rowan and Martin ' s Laugh-In. " 
When you guys hear this industry term , a breakout hit , what does that mean ? 
So then , just like the last chart , look what happens.
Now look at this.
Only one generation , 20 years in , and we discovered , Wow! TV can do that ? 
Archie Bunker was shoved out of his easy chair along with the rest of us 40 years ago.
Do we want to see shows about people saving money and being unemployed ? 
Glamorous and rich.
Whether or not you ' re in my business , you have surely heard or read of the decline of the thing called the three-camera sitcom and the rise of reality TV.
But look : X marks the spot.
We had the bursting of the tech bubble.
At the turn of the century , the Internet takes off , reality television has taken hold.
No , they want judgment.
That ' s all great , right ? 
The 1950s : June Cleever in the original comfort show ,  " Leave it to Beaver. " 
Murphy Brown took on a vice president when she took on the idea of single parenthood.
But let me also thank the incredible creators who get up everyday to put their ideas on our television screens throughout all these ages of television.
Psychologist Jonathan Haidt asks a simple , but difficult question : why do we search for self-transcendence ?  Why do we attempt to lose ourselves ?  In a tour through the science of evolution by group selection , he proposes a provocative answer.
I have a question for you : Are you religious ? 
Okay , here ' s another question : Do you think of yourself as spiritual in any way , shape or form ?  Raise your hand.
It ' s just a basic fact about being human that sometimes the self seems to just melt away.
So here ' s the metaphor I ' m offering today.
In 1902 , the great American psychologist William James wrote about the many varieties of religious experience.
And here ' s what Bradley said about it.
This world had no place in my affections.
And on this higher level he becomes loving and forgiving.
This is from a 16th century Aztec scroll showing a man about to eat a psilocybin mushroom and at the same moment get yanked up the staircase by a god.
Others overcome their self at raves.
I ' m going to play for you an excerpt from this book by Glenn Gray.
Glenn Gray : Many veterans will admit that the experience of communal effort in battle has been the high point of their lives.
JH : So what all of these cases have in common is that the self seems to thin out , or melt away , and it feels good , it feels really good , in a way totally unlike anything we feel in our normal lives.
The lower level he called the level of the profane.
We want to satisfy our individual desires.
Durkheim called this level the level of the sacred because he believed that the function of religion was to unite people into a group , into a moral community.
Think of the collective joy in Britain on the day World War II ended.
I ' m saying that the capacity for self-transcendence is just a basic part of being human.
So here ' s the million-dollar question for social scientists like me : Is the staircase a feature of our evolutionary design ? 
The New Atheists , for example , argue that religion is a set of memes , sort of parasitic memes , that get inside our minds and make us do all kinds of crazy religious stuff , self-destructive stuff , like suicide bombing.
In  " The Descent of Man, "  Charles Darwin wrote a great deal about the evolution of morality -- where did it come from , why do we have it.
He went on to say that  " Selfish and contentious people will not cohere , and without coherence nothing can be effected. " 
So look at it this way : You ' ve got competition going on within groups and across groups.
The slowest rowers , the weakest rowers , are going to get cut from the team.
And sometimes it would be advantageous for one of these guys to try to sabotage the other guys.
They can only win if they all pull together as a team.
Suppose we ' ve got a group of little organisms -- they can be bacteria , they can be hamsters ; it doesn ' t matter what -- and let ' s suppose that this little group here , they evolved to be cooperative.
There ' s a mutation in the gene and one of them mutates to follow a selfish strategy.
We start with just one green , and as it interacts it gains wealth or points or food.
But there are solutions to the free-rider problem.
For example , why is it that the mitochondria in every cell has its own DNA , totally separate from the DNA in the nucleus ? 
A superorganism can basically take what it wants.
Darwin ' s laws don ' t change , but now there ' s a new kind of player on the field and things begin to look very different.
And the most cohesive hives won , just as Darwin said.
And they unlocked the most powerful force ever known on this planet , which is human cooperation -- a force for construction and destruction.
In fact , often , as we ' ve seen happen in a lot of the Arab Spring revolts , often those divisions are along religious lines.
Or are they pursuing communal interest , which requires them to lose themselves and become simply a part of a whole ? 
One of the most common is climbing the secret staircase and losing ourselves.
I can ' t be certain if the staircase is an adaptation rather than a bug , but if it is an adaptation , then the implications are profound.
I mean that we evolved to see sacredness all around us and to join with others into teams and circle around sacred objects , people and ideas.
It ' s about the eternal struggle between good and evil , and we all believe we ' re on the good team.
We broke down the old institutions and brought liberty to the oppressed.
What should I do with my life ? 
Come , have a seat in my home entertainment center.
They ' re all searching for their staircase.
 " No man is an island entire of itself.
Author Sam Martin shares photos of a quirky world hobby that ' s trending with the XY set :  " manspaces. "  Grab a cold one and enjoy.
So , I am indeed going to talk about the spaces men create for themselves , but first I want to tell you why I ' m here.
And you can imagine , if you ' re a writer , that things would get really crowded around deadlines.
There was enough space . And I had control , which was very important.
Hemingway had his writing space.
Here is one of the first spaces I found . It is in Austin , Texas , which is where I ' m from.
It has neon concert posters , a bar and , of course , the leg lamp , which is very important.
Here ' s another outdoor space , a little bit more sophisticated.
So , pretty early on in my investigations I realized what I was finding was not what I expected to find , which was , quite frankly , a lot of beer can pyramids and overstuffed couches and flat-screen TVs.
Take this place for example.
On the inside it ' s a recreation of a 16th century Japanese tea house.
Here is another pretty typical scene . This is a suburban Las Vegas neighborhood.
He won the silver medal for Ireland in the 1992 Olympics , and he trains in this space . He trains other people.
It ' s a collection of nautical antiques from the 1700s and 1800s.
But they were also -- I was really impressed by how personalized they were , and how much work went into them.
And so they created these spaces to reflect what they love to do , and who they were.
design,exploration,humor,photography
I actually find them a lot more emotional -- -- and personal , and the neat thing about a slide projector is you can actually focus the work , unlike PowerPoint and some other programs.
And the thing you really hope for is occasionally they burn up , which we won ' t see tonight . So.
You come into this major airport , and they simply have a B.
Till a couple months later , I went back to the same airport -- same plane , I think -- and looked up , and it said C.
These are a couple of garage doors painted identical , situated next to each other.
O.K. , which one would you park in front of ? 
I would probably park in front of the other one.
And this graffiti artist has come along , made this sign a little bit better , and then moved on.
And I would argue that it ' s possibly more effective than the original billboard in terms of getting your attention , getting you to look over that way.
And  " The End of Print "  is now in its fifth printing.
So , apparently when photography was perfected , there were people going around saying , that ' s it : you ' ve just ruined painting.
I think it ' s not the only ingredient in design , but possibly the most important.
This is a quote from Albert Einstein , who says ,  " The intellect has little to do on the road to discovery.
I like this for a couple of reasons.
Just because something ' s legible doesn ' t means it communicates.
This is working with Marshall McLuhan.
So , this was the contents page originally.
So , a couple spreads from the book : here McLuhan says ,  " The new media are not bridges between Man and Nature ; they are Nature. " 
I hate this stuff . It ' s hard to read.
And I only show it because it seemed like it got all this relevancy all of a sudden , and it was done right after 9/11.

You ' d think maybe cement , possibly , or something.
I ' ve taken one shot ; I cropped it a few different ways.
I don ' t have the site . It ' s just the piece itself.

I do a lot of workshops all over the world , really , and this particular assignment was to come up with new symbols for the restroom doors.
It was a worldwide branding campaign.
And our goal was to try to humanize them a bit , and what I did was add type and people to the ad , which the previous campaign had not had , and nobody remembered them , and nobody referenced them.
You know : Thank God it ' s Monday -- I get to go back to that little cubicle , those fake gray walls , and hear everybody else ' s conversations f or 10 hours and then go home.
In Germany , they made one small change without checking with me -- nor did they have to , because it was done through agencies -- but see if you can tell the difference.
I just have a feeling this kid ' s been there for a week , you know.

http://www.ted.com/talks/kevin_kelly_on_how_technology_evolves.html
Kevin Kelly on how technology evolves
Should I be wary ?  Like you , I ' m very tempted by the latest thing.
So I ' m still perplexed about what the true meaning of technology is as it relates to humanity , as it relates to nature , as it relates to the spiritual.
It was the suggested syllabus for dealing with the Applied Arts and Science at Cambridge University in 1829.
So it sums up a lot of what we ' re talking about.
Something , again , that went back to something more fundamental.
The question that I came up with was this question : what does technology want ?  And by that , I don ' t mean , does it want chocolate or vanilla ?  By what it wants , I mean , what are its inherent trends and biases ? 
And I ' m applying a similar trick to say , what if we looked at the universe in our culture through the eyes of technology ?  What does technology want ? 
So that ' s where I want to begin my little exploration , is in life.
Brian Farrell ' s work is all part of this agenda to try and actually discover all the species on Earth.
Each one of these organisms that we ' ve described -- that you ' ve seen from Jamie and others , these magnificent things -- what they ' re doing , each one of them , is they ' re hacking the rules of life.
This is another version of that . This is a sea dragon , and the one on the bottom , the blue one , is a juvenile that has not yet swallowed the acid , has not yet taken in the brown-green algae pond scum into its body to give it energy.
And here we have a view of evolution where rather than having evolution go over the linear time , we have it coming out from the center.
Those fungi and bacteria are as highly evolved as humans.
One of the things about evolution is that nowhere on Earth have we ever been where we don ' t find life.
The second thing is is we see diversity . We also see specialization.
And the last thing , I bring back this nudibranch.
And so the general , long-term trends of evolution are roughly these five : ubiquity , diversity , specialization , complexity and socialization . Now , I took that and said , OK , what are the long-term trends in technology ? 
There ' s obviously diversity . Huge numbers of things.
I did some research and found out that the King of England , Henry VIII , had only about 7,000 items in his household.
Well , this is actually what we ' re headed towards : world machines.
So the major trends in technology evolution actually are the same as in biological evolution . The same drives that we see towards ubiquity , towards diversity , towards socialization , towards complexity . That is maybe not a big surprise because if we map out , say , the evolution of armor , you can actually follow a sort of an evolutionary-type cladistic tree.
This is Niles Eldredge . He was the co-developer with Stephen Jay Gould of the theory of punctuated equilibrium.
This is his chart , which is not quite published yet.
In fact , this idea of resurrecting the whole idea is so important that I began to think about what happens with old technology.
In fact , they ' re so around that you can buy new parts for a Stanley steam automobile.
So I took the great big 1895 Montgomery Ward ' s catalog and I randomly went through it . And I took a page -- not quite a random page -- I took a page that was actually more difficult than others because lots of the pages are filled with things that are still being made . But I took this page and I said , how many of these things are still being made ? 
I don ' t know who needs a corn sheller.
It ' s not just that it was resurrected . It ' s continued all along.
We ' ve heard about the Japanese giving up guns.
They ' re actually changing the way in which ideas are generated.
It ' s accelerating the way in which we search for ideas.
That ' s the definition of  " infinite game. "  A finite game is play to win , and an infinite game is played to keep playing.
There was no difference whatsoever . And at the Big Bang , what it expanded was the potential for difference.
That ' s what technology is bringing us : choices , possibilities , freedoms.
Differences , freedom , choices , possibilities.
Imagine Hitchcock before the technologies of film.
That ' s what technology really wants.
It ' s a terrible thing to spray DDT on cotton fields , but it ' s a really good thing to use to eliminate millions of cases of death due to malaria in a small village.
You see , technology is a way to evolve the evolution.
And so when I think about what technology wants , I think that it has to do with the fact that every person here -- and I really believe this -- every person here has an assignment . And your assignment is to spend your life discovering what your assignment is.
And so I think that we should embrace technology because it is an essential part of our journey in finding out who we are.

And the delta has alligators crawling in and out of rivers filled with fish and cypress trees dripping with snakes , birds of every flavor.
I was in the gulf , and I was swimming around and saw a little octopus on the bottom.
Then it sort of calmed down in the palms of my hands and started flashing colors , just pulsing all of these colors.
The octopus left my hands and then did the damnedest thing : It landed on the bottom in the rubble and -- fwoosh! -- vanished right before my eyes.
And the aquarium had a lot of big fish tanks but not a lot of invertebrate displays , and being the spineless guy , I thought , well I ' ll just go out in the field and collect these wonderful animals I had been learning about as a student and bring them in , and I built these elaborate sets and put them on display.
And you walk up to the front of the tank . Then you realize that these animals all have different personalities : Some of them would hold their ground , others would slink into the back of the tank and disappear in the rocks , and one in particular , this amazing animal ...
Anyway , there we were , staring at each other , and he reaches down and grabs an armful of gravel and releases it in the jet of water entering the tank from the filtration system , and -- chk chk chk chk chk! -- this gravel hits the front of the glass and falls down.
And then I realize the octopus won the arms race , because I was out and he had six left.
He said ,  " Make a movie about this expedition. " 
Yeah , I ' ll be a filmmaker. " 
If you ' re a wildlife filmmaker and you ' re going out into the field to film animals , especially behavior , it helps to have a fundamental background on who these animals are , how they work and , you know , a bit about their behaviors.
Anyway , one tree is situated right next to a beautiful coral reef.
As a matter of fact , there ' s one right there.
And you knew what the limit was : they would start getting twitchy and you ' d back up , come back in a few hours.
And one of the most fantastic displays that I remember , or at least visually , was a foraging behavior.
And as soon as the crabs touched the arm , it was lights out.
If you ' re going to make a lot of films about a particular group of animals , you might as well pick one that ' s fairly common.
It ' s like nothing you ' ve ever done.
And as you go down , the washing machine at the surface calms down.
And finally , it ' s a rich lavender , and after a couple of thousand feet , it ' s ink black.
But we ' re just going to zip right past this area , this area that includes about 95 percent of the living space on our planet and go to the mid-ocean ridge , which I think is even more extraordinary.
And when you dive into that rift valley , that ' s where the action is because literally thousands of active volcanoes are going off at any point in time all along this 40,000 mile range.
And this vent fluid is about 600 or 700 degrees F.
And all along the sides of these chimneys is shimmering with heat and loaded with life.
And this whole ecosystem wasn ' t even known about until 33 years ago.
But down there , there is no sun , there is no photosynthesis ; it ' s chemosynthetic environment down there driving it , and it ' s all so ephemeral.
There ' s no hot water.
And there ' s a whole new hydrothermal vent community that has been formed.
And you go back , and I ' m at home , and I ' m thinking ,  " Okay , what can I shoot ...
There ' s no coral , algae growing on it , and the water ' s pea soup.
And this is the tropics.
But , encouragingly , I ' ve seen just the opposite.
It ' s got living coral , fish all over the place , crystal clear water , and you go ,  " How did that happen ?  " 
I think Margaret Mead said it best.
I ' m a big fan of grassroots organizations.
Fair enough question.
What do you really care about that isn ' t right where you live ? 
And in fact , the way that we can communicate today -- where Alaska is instantly knowing what ' s going on in China , and the Kiwis did this , and then over in England they tried to ...
Look in your own backyard , in fact , look in the mirror.
In theory , we ' re thinking , rational human beings.
And it ' s my hope that some of these  " hope spots "  can be in the deep ocean , an area that has historically been seriously neglected , if not abused.
And that I do.
art,comedy,culture,humor,media,peace,women
Not that I ' m not afraid now , but I ' ve learned to pretend.
Back in the  ' 50s and  ' 60s , when I was growing up , little girls were supposed to be kind and thoughtful and pretty and gentle and soft , and we were supposed to fit into roles that were sort of shadowy -- really not quite clear what we were supposed to be.
She was a homemaker , but she and I didn ' t go out and do girlie things together , and she didn ' t buy me pink outfits.
I was launched as a cartoonist.
Now the rules that I ' m talking about are constantly being monitored by the culture.
And on top of all off these rules , they keep changing.
It takes what we know , and it twists it.
Because women are on the ground floor , and we know the traditions so well , we can bring a different voice to the table.
And then also my family was in chaos , and I drew to try to bring my family together -- -- try to bring my family together with laughter.
I found that I didn ' t have to wear high heels , I didn ' t have to wear pink , and I could feel like I fit in.
I always loved political cartoons , so why don ' t I do something with the content of my cartoons to make people think about the stupid rules that we ' re following as well as laugh ?  " 
But I believe that the rules that I ' m talking about are universal , of course -- that each culture has its different codes of behavior and dress and traditions , and each woman has to deal with these same things that we do here in the U.S.
Now my work lately has been to collaborate with international cartoonists , which I so enjoy , and it ' s given me a greater appreciation for the power of cartoons to get at the truth , to get at the issues quickly and succinctly.
But I feel blessed to be able to work with them.
Physicist Geoffrey West has found that simple , mathematical laws govern the properties of cities -- that wealth , crime rate , walking speed and many other aspects of a city can be deduced from a single number : the city ' s population . In this mind-bending talk from TEDGlobal he shows how it works and how similar laws hold for organisms and corporations.
Cities are the crucible of civilization.
And the tsunami of problems that we feel we ' re facing in terms of sustainability questions are actually a reflection of the exponential increase in urbanization across the planet.
The planet has crossed the halfway mark a few years ago.
Everybody in this room , if you stay alive , is going to be affected by what ' s happening in cities in this extraordinary phenomenon.
And so there ' s an urgent need for a scientific theory of cities.
The 10 billion people on the planet in 2050 want to live in places like this , having things like this , doing things like this , with economies that are growing like this , not realizing that entropy produces things like this , this , this and this.
So my provocative statement is that we desperately need a serious scientific theory of cities.
Are there universal laws ? 
Is Edinburgh a horse ? 
And if that is the case , how come that it ' s very hard to kill a city ? 
And if you have a serious theory , you should be able to predict when Google is going to go bust.
We have a mathematical framework based on generic universal principles that can answer those questions.
The same principles , the same dynamics , the same organization is at work in all of these , including us , and it can scale over a range of 100 million in size.
That ' s called growth.
And you see , you ' re very familiar with this.
This is just the weight versus the age.
This is what we believe.
So let ' s first talk about biology.
And what you see if you plot it in this slightly curious way is that everybody lies on the same line.
Something else is going on.
It says that , if it were linear , the steepest slope , then doubling the size you would require double the amount of energy.
Now any physiological variable you can think of , any life history event you can think of , if you plot it this way , looks like this.
All of life is controlled by networks -- from the intracellular through the multicellular through the ecosystem level.
If you take those networks , this idea of networks , and you apply universal principles , mathematizable , universal principles , all of these scalings and all of these constraints follow , including the description of the forest , the description of your circulatory system , the description within cells.
So is London a scaled up Birmingham , which is a scaled up Brighton , etc. , etc. ? 
Cities are just a physical manifestation of your interactions , our interactions , and the clustering and grouping of individuals.
There is a scaling.
Less petrol stations per capita the bigger you are -- not surprising.
And any infrastructure you look at -- whether it ' s the length of roads , length of electrical lines -- anything you look at has the same economy of scale scaling in the same way.
And the bottom one is you lot -- super-creatives plotted in the same way.
And we ' ve looked at everything : more AIDS cases , flu , etc.
And here ' s the statement.
Because they think that all those wonderful things -- like creative people , wealth , income -- is what attracts them , forgetting about the ugly and the bad.
Always , all the data shows it ' s the same , despite the fact that these cities have evolved independently.
So there it is , I ' ve said it again.
On the left is the heart rate showing biology.
Economies of scale gave rise to this sigmoidal behavior.
And in fact , if you compare it to data , it fits very well with the development of cities and economies.
What we do is , as we grow and we approach the collapse , a major innovation takes place and we start over again , and we start over again as we approach the next one , and so on.
We have to accelerate on a continuous basis.
The top one , in fact , is Walmart on the right.
There it is : after some little fluctuations at the beginning , when companies are innovating , they scale beautifully.
In that interpretation , by bureaucracy and administration , and they do it beautifully , may I say.
That ' s what we like , hockey sticks.
So if I ' d have done this in 1994 , I could have predicted what Walmart would be now.

Diana Laufenberg : How to learn ?  From mistakes
It was in the books ; it was inside the teacher ' s head ; and she needed to go there to get the information , because that ' s how you learned.
It was purchased the year I was born , and it was extraordinary , because I did not have to wait to go to the library to get to the information.
I could get access to it.
Kids in the 12th grade : not exactly all that enthusiastic about the American government system.
I posed a problem in front of them , which was to put on an election forum for their own community.
They invited everyone into the school for an evening of conversation about government and politics and whether or not the streets were done well , and really had this robust experiential learning.
And that night , all 90 kids -- dressed appropriately , doing their job , owning it.
And they will step up.
Again ,  " thrilled "  to learn.
We could walk there . We didn ' t even have to pay for the buses.
I then challenged the kids to identify someone in their own life , or in their own story , or in their own world , that they could identify that had done a similar thing.
It was the most awesome moment of revelation that when you ask kids to use their own voice and ask them to speak for themselves , what they ' re willing to share.
I teach at the Science Leadership Academy , which is a partnership school between the Franklin Institute and the school district of Philadelphia.
Why do you have kids come to school if they no longer have to come there to get the information ? 
That is the absolute wrong thing to ask , to tell kids to never be wrong.
My students produced these info-graphics as a result of a unit that we decided to do at the end of the year responding to the oil spill.
They can talk -- they ' re very smooth , and they can write very , very well , but asking them to communicate ideas in a different way was a little uncomfortable for them.
And the student that persistently turns out the best visual product did not disappoint.
And they immediately went ,  " There it is. " 
And there ' s some .. .  "  And they went through all that we processed out loud.
It asked them to create for themselves , and it allowed them to fail , process , learn from.
They will not disappoint.
But this is learning too , because we asked them to go out into real spaces.
http://www.ted.com/talks/alan_russell_on_regenerating_our_bodies.html
Alan Russell on regenerating our bodies
Diabetes , cancer , Parkinson ' s , Alzheimer ' s , heart failure , lung failure -- things that we know are debilitating diseases , for which there ' s relatively little that can be done.
This was an issue from 2002 that they published with a lot of different articles on the bionic human.
So we know how to do this in many of the ways that are up there.
This is not regenerative medicine.
Very few good ideas -- if you agree that this is a good idea -- very few good ideas are truly novel.
We ' ve come a long way since then.
One of the challenges is that the richer we are , the longer we live.
Why is this important ? 
Just have a look at the demographics in the U.S . here.
In 2010 , two workers per retiree in the U.S.
And you can see that right around age 45 , 40 to 45 , there ' s a sudden spike in the cost of health care.
There are very few things , very few things that you can really do that will change the way that you can treat these kinds of diseases and experience what I would call healthy aging.
One thing you can do is not treat . You can ration health care.
But perhaps most interesting , to me anyway , and most important , is the idea of diagnosing a disease much earlier on in the progression , and then treating the disease to cure the disease instead of treating a symptom.
And we do OK . Insulin ' s a pretty good therapy.
This video , I think , gets across the concept that I ' m talking about quite dramatically.
But what we ' re talking about in regenerative medicine is doing this in every organ system of the body , for tissues and for organs themselves.
There are 370 soldiers that have come back from Iraq that have lost limbs.
But it ' s applicable , again , to every organ system.
And to switch on processes that we knew how to do when we were a fetus.
In a child , before the age of about six months , if they lose their fingertip in an accident , they ' ll re-grow their fingertip.
I ' m going to give you an example of three of these tools through which to converse with the body.
Secondly , we can use materials.
I ' m going to show you an example of each of these , and I ' m going to start with materials.
He asked the question , if I take that material , which is a natural material that usually induces healing in the small intestine , and I place it somewhere else on a person ' s body , would it give a tissue-specific response , or would it make small intestine if I tried to make a new ear ? 
What I ' m about to show you is a diabetic ulcer.
So I ' m going to put the slide up now . It won ' t be up for long.
And this lady decided , after a year of attempted treatment of that ulcer , that she would try this new therapy that Steve invented.
There ' s going to be a couple more distressing slides for those of you -- I ' ll let you know when you can look again.
Just a few weeks after treatment -- in this case , taking that material , turning it into a gel , and packing that area , and then repeating the treatment a few times -- and the horse heals up.
Could you regenerate a limb ? 
Remember that I mentioned before the children who lose their fingertips.
There are materials that do this . Here are the heart patches.
This was done by Teruo Okano at Tokyo Women ' s Hospital.
Now I ' m going to show you cell-based regeneration.
So this is a bypass operation , just like what Al Gore had , with a difference.
And if you look really carefully , it ' s going to be right around this point you ' ll actually see a back-flush.
This was a randomized trial.
These are now two years out.
We don ' t have time to go into all of those details , but basically , that works too.
They ' ve decided that liposuction fluid , which -- in the United States , we have a lot of liposuction fluid.
Out comes the liposuction fluid , and in this case , the stem cells are isolated and turned into neurons.
Here ' s just one example before I close up.
And if there ' s anything that ' s been learned about burn , it ' s that we don ' t know how to treat it.
And that bio-reactor will lay down in the wound bed.
It ' s a completely different way of doing it.
It ' s very powerful work.
A number of governments , and a number of regions , have recognized that this is a new way to treat disease.
They need this to work or their health system dies.
China just launched a national tissue-engineering center.
We ' ve had a different approach.
Myself and Jay Vacanti from Harvard went to visit with him and a number of his directors of his institute just a few months ago , to try and convince him that it was time to take just a little piece of that 27.5 billion dollars that he ' s going to get next year and focus it , in a strategic way , to make sure we can accelerate the pace at which these things get to patients.
In this hilariously lively performance , actress Sarah Jones channels an opinionated elderly Jewish woman , a fast-talking Dominican college student and more , giving TED2009 just a sample of her spectacular character range.
I should tell you that when I was asked to be here , I thought to myself that well , it ' s TED.
And then I thought no , no . I should just get up there and be myself and just talk the way I really talk because , after all , this is the great unveiling.
And while I don ' t have any patents that I ' m aware of , you will be meeting a few of my inventions today.
To what extent do we self-construct , do we self-invent ? 
And so I ' ve brought a couple of them with me.
Okay . Okay . Oh , well.
Ah , thank you very much . My name is Lorraine Levine.
She ' s a very nice , young black girl.
And you know what that means , of course.
Really , it ' s amazing.
And she was getting a yogurt in the Google cafe.
And -- oh , I saw Goldie Hawn.
Yeah . But even so , a wonderful talent.
It ' s such an eye-opening experience to be here.
You know , your parents must be very proud.
It ' s like a rainbow.
I just -- I don ' t want to offend anybody . You know.
It ' s true . It ' s true.
Anyway.
And congratulations on being such big makhers that you ' ve become TED meisters.
Thank you everybody.
Actually , you could say I grew up in the capital of Dominican Republic , otherwise known as Washington Heights in New York City.
And I just -- you know I ' m not used to doing the public speaking.
But then on top of that , you know , Sarah Jones told me we only have 18 minutes.
Like , I love everything about this . It ' s amazing.
I mean I know it ' s a real person and everything , but I ' m just saying that like , you know , I think it ' s very cool how it ' s also an acronym , you know , which is like , you know , is like very high concept and everything like that.
At my school -- actually I was part of co-founding an organization , which is like a leadership thing , you know , like you guys , you would really like it and everything.
I am a working mother , and I also go to school full-time.
Right now it ' s very exciting actually for me because I ' m the Junior Assistant to the Associate Director under the Senior Vice President for Business Development -- that ' s my new title.
So , we deserve just as much to be part of the exchange of ideas as everybody else.
And if you don ' t mind , privately now , in the future , I ' m going to think of TED as an acronym for Technology , Entertainment and Dominicans.
In fact , the older lady you just met : very , very loosely based on a great aunt on my mother ' s side.
And it was Madame Bousson , you know , she was very [French].
And we were only 11 years old , so it was not appropriate.
The teacher , Herr Schtopf , he never discriminated.
For example , a friend of mine.
But , you know , I am originally from India , and I wanted to start by telling you that once Sarah Jones told me that we will be having the opportunity to come here to TED in California , originally , I was very pleased and , frankly , relieved because , you know , I am a human rights advocate.
So , but I ' m thrilled to be joining all of you here.
Uh , well , thank you.
But then , I decided , just like Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger , I try anyway.
And we tried to teach our kids to be proud of their tradition , but it ' s very hard.
But that ' s where we had some problems.
But I think he will change his mind soon.
She only wants to spend time with her friends.
So , I accused my daughter to have like a secret boyfriend.
I am lesbian. " 
So , these are the words I am waiting to hear , but from my son , not my daughter.
So I think maybe TED , you impact people ' s lives in the ways maybe even you don ' t realize.
And I would like to first of all thank Sarah Jones for putting all of the pressure on the only Arab who she brought with her to be last today.
But I feel a bit like a fish out of water.
But , while I know that I may not look like the typical TED-izen , as you would say , I do like to make the point that we in global society , we are never as different as the appearances may suggest.
I want to hold your hand.
If it is sounding familiar , it is because I was at the same time in my life listening to the Beatles.
That ' s all , shukran . Thank you very much for the opportunity.
Thank you very , very much . I love you.
It ' s been a long time coming , and I feel like I ' m home.
Dr . Seyi Oyesola takes a searing look at health care in underdeveloped countries . His photo tour of a Nigerian teaching hospital -- all low-tech hacks and donated supplies -- drives home the challenge of doing basic health care there.
Just to put everything in context , and to kind of give you a background to where I ' m coming from , so that a lot of the things I ' m going to say , and the things I ' m going to do -- or things I ' m going to tell you I ' ve done -- you will understand exactly why and how I got motivated to be where I am.
And by the time I was an intern house officer , I could barely afford to maintain my mother ' s 13-year-old car -- and I was a paid doctor.
All right , for good measure , that ' s where Nigeria is on the African map , and just there is the Delta region that I ' m sure everybody ' s heard of.
How many people do you think are on that taxi ? 
So , when these kind of people -- and , believe me , it ' s not just the police that use these taxis in Lagos . We all do . I ' ve been on one of these , and I didn ' t have a helmet , either.
And like I tell my family , and my wife reminds me every time ,  " You ' re risking your life , you know , every time you go to that country. " 
I ' m saying , where do they go when they ' re like me ? 
These are not old pictures and these are not from some downtrodden -- this is a major hospital . In fact , it ' s from a major teaching hospital in Nigeria.
Yes , I ' m sorry if it upsets some of you , but I think you need to see this . That ' s the floor , OK ? 
In fact , when I start running around saying ,  " Hey , boys and girls , you ' re cardiologists in the U.S. , can you come home with me and do a mission ?  " 
Anesthesiology and critical care -- look at that bag.
All right , this is a slide from a talk I gave about intensive care units in Nigeria , and jokingly we refer to it as  " Expensive Scare. " 
I think we all know . And several speakers before and speakers after me are going to tell us even more problems.
We all went out and did a mission and we ' ve done three of them so far.
You get wealthier faster if you are healthy first.
Does he look like he ' s happy ? 
I got him to come with me -- anesthesia tech -- come with me from the U.K.
Equipment that ' s obsolete , equipment that doesn ' t quite work , or it works and you can ' t fix it . And there ' s nothing wrong with that , so long as we use it and we move on.
It looks like all these Americans are here and yes , one Brit , and he ' s not going to do anything -- he thinks he ' s British actually , and he ' s actually Nigerian , I just thought about that.
I mean , what ' s an X-ray viewing box ?  Please.
OK , I know it ' s not AIDS , I know it ' s not malaria , but we still need this stuff . Oh yeah , echo -- this was just to get the children ready and the adults ready.
Her condition , open-heart surgery that as she required , would have been treated when she was a child.
But how many did we do the first one ?  12.
That ' s what he was doing , propping up the bed because the bed simply didn ' t work.
Thank you . Sustainable Solutions -- this was my first company.
And that ' s a perfect example of one.
That ' s exactly how the outlets are designed.
And guess what , if it all fails , if you can find a car that ' s still got a live battery and you stick it in , it will still work . Then you can customize it.
The technology for oxygen delivery is not new.
These are the basic features of my device , or our device.
This picture was taken last year.
African people , because they will do it with a passion , I hope.
Film producer Jeff Skoll talks about his film company , Participant Productions , and the people who ' ve inspired him to do good.
I ' ve actually been waiting by the phone for a call from TED for years.
And finally , I get a call last year , and then I have to go up after J.J . Abrams.
And I also found that Hollywood and Silicon Valley have a lot more in common than I would have dreamed.
So it turned out there was a lot more in common than I would have dreamed.
It ' s a world of peace and prosperity and sustainability.
But perhaps the other , bigger gap is what we call the hope gap.
And if the men and women of TED can ' t make a difference in the world , I don ' t know who can.
And their stories made the world seem a very small and interconnected place.
And my dad came home one day and announced that he had cancer , and it looked pretty bad.
So I set out in a hurry . I studied engineering.
And while I was there , I made friends with a fellow named Pierre Omidyar , who is here today . And Pierre , I apologize for this . This is a photo from the old days.
But right after that , Pierre -- in  ' 96 , Pierre and I left our full-time jobs to build eBay as a company . And the rest of that story , you know.
I went from living in a house with five guys in Palo Alto and living off their leftovers , to all of a sudden having all kinds of resources.
And I asked him what he felt was the best thing I could do , or anyone could do , to make a difference in the long-term issues facing humanity.
I started a foundation to bet on these good people doing good things.
But there ' s also a lot of people that you don ' t know.
And by 2010 , she hopes to eliminate this disease , which is really a scourge in the developing world.
And invest : if you see good people doing good things , invest in them . Invest in their organizations , or in business . Invest in these folks.
And a light bulb went off , which was , first , that I didn ' t actually have to do the writing myself , I could find writers.
And there really wasn ' t a specific company that was focused on the public interest.
 " The surest way to become a millionaire is to start by being a billionaire and go into the movie business. " 
We want them to actually get involved in the issues.
And it turned out to be a pretty good year for this guy.
One of these films in particular , called  " North Country, "  was actually kind of a box office disaster.
And that to me , spoke volumes , because it ' s -- the film started about a true-life story about a woman who was harassed , sued her employer , led to a landmark case that led to the Equal Opportunity Act , and the Violence Against Women Act and others.
At that point , I thought I knew something about global warming.
And with Al ' s blessing , we decided on the spot to turn it into a film , because we felt that we could get the message out there far more quickly than having Al go around the world , speaking to audiences of 100 or 200 at a time.
We ' ve sent 50,000 DVDs to high school teachers in the U.S.
And for Participant , this is just the start.
One is  " Charlie Wilson ' s War, "  with Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts.
We premiered a film called  " The Chicago 10 "  at Sundance this year.
In closing , I ' d like to say that everybody has the opportunity to make change in their own way.
And I believe if we do these things , we can close the opportunity gaps , we can close the hope gaps.
And I believe that , working together , we can make all of these things happen.

Annie Lennox : Why I am an HIV/AIDS activist
And 46664 is the number that Mandela had when he was imprisoned in Robben Island.
It was quite a momentous occasion for all of us.
I have to serve. " 
I think that if I went out into the street now and I told people what was happening there , they would be shocked.
This is a tool -- this tells you I am in solidarity with people who have HIV , people who are living with HIV.
It ' s a grassroots campaign with 80 percent membership being women , most of whom are HIV-positive.
They bring out the issues of stigma.
So this is my SING Campaign.
In Johannesburg , I had the opportunity to play to a mainly white , middle-class South African audience who ended up in tears because I use film clips that really touch the heart , the whole nature , of this terrible tragedy that is taking place , that people are tending to avoid , because they are fatigued , and they really don ' t quite know what the solutions are.
And I was showing them my experiences and trying to , again , raise awareness.
And I ' m very honored by the fact that Michel invited me , only a few months ago , to become a UNAIDS ambassador.
This can happen.
It ' s one way to start looking at intervention with the AIDS pandemic.
Avelile ' s mother had HIV virus -- she died from AIDS-related illness.
We met her in a hospital in the Eastern Cape and spent a whole afternoon with her -- an adorable child.
So , it was obviously -- it was a very emotional encounter and left us feeling very resonant with this direct experience , this one child , you know , that story.
This is the transformation that took place.
So , I would like to say to you , each one in the audience , if you feel that every mother and every child in the world has the right to have access to good nutrition and good medical care , and you believe that the Millennium Development Goals , specifically five and six , should be absolutely committed to by all governments around the world -- especially in sub-Saharan Africa -- could you please stand up.

Big Brother : We are one people with one will , one resolve , one cause.
And you ' ll see why 1984 won ' t be like  " 1984. " 
The American political cartoonist Mark Fiore also had his satire application censored in the United States because some of Apple ' s staff were concerned it would be offensive to some groups.
So here ' s the thing.
So here ' s the situation.
And their sovereignties , cross-cutting , globally interlinked , can in some ways challenge the sovereignties of nation-states in very exciting ways , but sometimes also act to project and extend it at a time when control over what people can and cannot do with information has more effect than ever on the exercise of power in our physical world.
But overthrowing a government is one thing and building a stable democracy is a bit more complicated.
And one activist actually found a contract from a Western company for the sale of surveillance technology to the Egyptian security forces.
In protest over this , blogger Slim Amamou , who had been jailed under Ben Ali and then became part of the transitional government after the revolution , he resigned in protest from the cabinet.
As Riadh Guerfali , the veteran digital activist from Tunisia , remarked over this incident ,  " Before , things were simple : you had the good guys on one side and the bad guys on the other.
In fact , in the United States , whatever you may think of Julian Assange , even people who are not necessarily big fans of his are very concerned about the way in which the United States government and some companies have handled Wikileaks.
But borders do persist in some parts of cyberspace.
Now in China , you have the  " great firewall, "  as it ' s well-known , that blocks Facebook and Twitter and now Google+ and many of the other overseas websites.
In plain English , that means censorship and surveillance of their users.
But this is a website called Rospil that ' s an anti-corruption site.
So the important question , I think , is not this debate over whether the Internet is going to help the good guys more than the bad guys.
So the question is , we know how to hold government accountable.
You have situations , for instance , in France where president Sarkozy tells the CEO ' s of Internet companies ,  " We ' re the only legitimate representatives of the public interest. " 
After all , companies didn ' t stop polluting groundwater as a matter of course , or employing 10-year-olds as a matter of course , just because executives woke up one day and decided it was the right thing to do.
We need to make the same approach with the Internet.
So now we need to figure out how to build consent of the networked.
Each and every one of us has a vital part to play in building the kind of world in which government and technology serve the world ' s people and not the other way around.

Comparable , in its own very peculiar way , to the achievements of Microsoft or Google.
But in the last two decades , it has experienced an unprecedented expansion , now accounting for roughly 15 percent of the world ' s GDP.
But first , I would like to take you back to this event : the collapse of communism.
I had started smuggling books across the Iron Curtain to Democratic opposition groups in Eastern Europe , like Solidarity in Poland , when I was in my teens.
And amongst the chaos , amidst the euphoria , it took me a little while to understand that some of the people who had wielded power before 1989 , in Eastern Europe , continued to do so after the revolutions there.
They used to win the gold medals in weightlifting and wrestling , every four years in the Olympics , and they were the great celebrities of communism , with a fabulous lifestyle to go with it.
Here are some of those same weightlifters after their 1989 makeover.
So what was a business man in the brave new world of East European capitalism going to do to make sure that his contracts would be honored ? 
Now , when your state is collapsing , your economy is heading south at a rate of knots , the last people you want coming on to the labor market are 14,000 men and women whose chief skills are surveillance , are smuggling , building underground networks and killing people.
And I came to think that behind the violence lay a sinister criminal enterprise.
Why ?  Well of course there was the issue of law and order collapsing , but also , as they say in the retail trade , it ' s location , location , location.
The European Union , which by now was beginning to reap the benefits of globalization , transforming it into the most affluent consumer market in history , eventually comprising some 500 million people.
It has zones of distribution , like Mexico and the Balkans.
Six thousand people killed there in the last 18 months as a direct consequence of the cocaine trade.
And why is it ?  Because mafias from all around the world cooperate with local paramilitaries in order to seize the supplies of the rich mineral resources of the region.
And it is this Western desire to consume that is the primary driver of international organized crime.
So if you can smuggle them into the E.U. , there are very handsome profits to be made , and I want to show you this to demonstrate the type of resources available to these groups.
And as a consequence of this trade , Britain alone lost eight billion dollars in revenue.
Sometimes the gangsters would bring with them women being trafficked into prostitution , and if the police intervened , they would hurl the women into the sea so that the police had to go and save them from drowning , rather than chasing the bad guys.
So what were these guys doing with all the money they were making ? 
The last two decades have been the champagne era for dirty lucre.
Now these things are an essential part of the money laundering parade , and if you want to do something about illegal tax evasion and transnational organized crime , money laundering , you have to get rid of them.
That puts him up there on the Olympus of gangsters with the Colombian cartels and the major Russian crime syndicates , but he did this for decades in the very heart of Wall Street , and no regulator picked up on it.
And that is narcotics . Our second marijuana farm photograph for the morning.
Now , I was taken by inspector Brian Cantera , of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police , to a cavernous warehouse east of Vancouver to see some of the goods which are regularly confiscated by the RCMP from the smugglers who are sending it , of course , down south to the United States where there is an insatiable market for B.C . Bud , as it ' s called , in part because it ' s marketed as organic , which of course goes down very well in California.
This , however , may all be about to change , because something very strange is going on.
When that happens , it is a trend which is set to overwhelm our policing capacity in the West.
Not surprising , the most opportunistic industry in the whole world.
People don ' t smoke as much dope , or visit prostitutes quite so frequently during a recession.
Or perhaps I should say , more accurately , Señor Pringle.
It ' s really not that difficult.
You would not believe how easy it is to persuade people to do things with their computers which are objectively not in their interest.
Now , she harbored all sorts of sentiments and emotions towards me at the time , but love was not amongst them.
These are mosquitoes who carry the malarial parasite which infests our blood when the mosy has had a free meal at our expense.
And these pills contain only low doses of the active ingredient.
They affect our bank accounts.
There is no romance involved with gangsters in the 21st Century.

Elaine Morgan says we evolved from aquatic apes
And what they ' re planning to do is to enlighten us on almost every aspect of Darwin and his life , and how he changed our thinking.
It ' s the question of , why are we so different from the chimpanzees ? 
I ' m talking about ground-base , nitty-gritty , measurable physical differences.
If we changed so much , something must have happened.
They knew what happened.
And we got so overheated in the chase that we had to take off that fur coat and throw it away.
And they weren ' t savanna species.
The fossilized pollen was not of savanna vegetation.
It ' s not a minority theory.
We ' ve got to go back to square one and start again. " 
You ' ve believed it through generations.
What do you do ?  What does a scientist do in that case ? 
So they say ,  " Yes it ' s wrong , but supposing it was right ... " 
Some of them have even elevated it into a principle.
And we just record what we see. " 
And he despised it from the bottom of his heart.
It had been waiting there since 1960 when Alister Hardy , a marine biologist , said ,  " I think what happened , perhaps our ancestors had a more aquatic existence for some of the time. " 
You ' ve exposed us to public ridicule!
I think that Hardy had a lot going for him.
And a couple of wallowers-in-mud like the babirusa.
You ' ve forgotten all about the elephant haven ' t you ?  " 
But by now , everybody agrees that the elephant had an aquatic ancestor.
So this is a close connection between nakedness and water.
The only exception is the naked Somalian mole-rat , which never puts its nose above the surface of the ground.
There is only one circumstance in which they always , all of them , walk on two legs , and that is when they are wading through water.
We have got , under our skin , a layer of fat , all over : nothing in the least like that in any other primate.
We cannot avoid the suspicion that in our case it ' s started to happen.
The question of why we can speak.
You can ' t even train a gorilla to say  " Ah "  on request.
Trying to imagine a diver diving into water -- hardly makes a splash.
There is nothing there.
They conducted a serious investigation of this at the beginning , when Hardy put forward his article. " 
I ask people sometimes , and they say ,  " I like the aquatic theory!
They say  " Well ...
History is strewn with the cases when they ' ve all got it wrong.
There was Professor Tobias . He ' s come over.
The water is lovely.
 " Yeah well we don ' t talk about that . Let ' s talk about something interesting. " 
No sign of that happening either.
It ended with a new synthesis : Darwin ' s ideas and Mendel ' s ideas blending together.
And we can move forward from there , and really get somewhere.
So if it ' s going to come and it ' s going to happen , what ' s holding it up ? 
And it ' s not easy to change their minds.
 " Horizon, "  which takes its cue from the academics , won ' t touch it with a barge pole.
And if you hope to make progress in this profession , and you do believe it , you ' d better keep it to yourself , because it will get in your way. " 
Right . I ' ll go ahead with that.
Performer and web toymaker Ze Frank delivers a hilarious nerdcore standup routine , then tells us what he ' s seriously passionate about : helping people create and interact using simple , addictive web tools.
You know , when Chris first approached me to speak at TED , I said no , because I felt like I wasn ' t going to be able to make that personal connection , you know , that I wanted to.
And two -- I want to pick the theme for TED 2006.
 " Dear Sir , Good day , compliments of the day , and my best wishes to you and family . I know this letter will come to you surprisingly , but let it not be a surprise to you , for nature has a way of arriving unannounced , and , as an adage says , originals are very hard to find , but their echoes sound louder . So I decided to contact you myself , for you to assure me of safety and honesty , if I have to entrust any amount of money under your custody.
This fund was supposed to be used for the rehabilitation of water reserves all over the country , before the outbreak of war . When the war broke out , the rebel leader demanded that the fund be given to him , my father insisted it was not in his possession , and he was killed because of his refusal to release the fund.
I do not wish to invest the money in Senegal due to unfavorable economic climate , and so close to my country.
I was told backstage that I have 18 minutes.
What ' s your name ? 
Are you ?  Oh , yeah . So what are you , like , a thousand , two thousand , somewhere in there ?  Huh ?  Oh ? 
And that ' s nothing to be ashamed of.
And they were telling me that Google software has gotten so advanced that , based on your interaction with Google over your lifetime , they can actually predict what you are going to say next.
and my name , and it would tell me . And I have to tell you , right now , this is an unadulterated piece of software , this is a real Internet browser and this is an actual Google site , and we ' re going to test it out live today.
Audience : Yes.
By Monday , over a million people were coming to this site a day.
But some people refer to me more of -- as , like , an Internet guru or -- swami.
I ' m obsessed with email . I get a lot of it.
For example , somebody wrote me.
But you know , it ' s kind of a collaboration between me and the fans , so I said ,  " Sure. " 
I guess Chris has to take some credit here , because in years past , I guess there ' s been some sort of subpar speakers at TED . I don ' t know.
I ' d like to tell all of you a little joke . Not just the good stuff , though.
Voice : We want Malcolm Gladwell.
 " Ah , the first time that I made love to a rock shrimp ... " 
I came up with a few games.
So that didn ' t go over so well.
But you come back as a duck.
It ' s the third in the series.
So really , what are we talking about here ?  Oh , tech joy.
And so , what I ' ve done is , I started getting interested in creating online social spaces to share that feeling with people who don ' t consider themselves artists.
Here I created a contest called ,  " When Office Supplies Attack, "  which , I think , really resonated with the -- working population.
I think they ' re wonderful.
So , the Scribbler is an attempt to create a generative tool.
And here are some of my favorites . This is the little trap marionette that was submitted to me . Here we are , very cool.
But , I think , it ' s a -- it ' s a really fun and wonderful thing.
I think that the  " now tied up , tied down , mistress cruel approaches me , now tied down , it ' s up. " 
It dances to music . Lotte Reiniger , an amazing shadow puppeteer in the  ' 20s , that started doing more elaborate things.
http://www.ted.com/talks/omar_ahmad_political_change_with_pen_and_paper.html
Omar Ahmad : Political change with pen and paper
So , how do you do that ? 
What we need to understand is : What drives the political creature ? 
Now you may think it ' s money , but that ' s actually sort of a proxy to what I can do to preserve myself.
Well , unfortunately , I ' ve got so many Viagra ads coming at me , your email is lost.
That doesn ' t move.
So what actually works ? 
Letters actually work.
First of all , you ' re going to pick up an analog device : a pen.
Second of all , I ' m going to recommend that you get into a proactive stance and write to your elected officials at least once a month.
So in paragraph number one , what I ' m going to tell you to do is very simply this : You appreciate them.
So , here you go.
Paragraph number three : When animals are attacked or cornered , they will fight to the death , so you have to give them an exit.
Lastly , you want to be the nurturing agent.
You ' re going to do that by the way you sign your letter.
Here is one very quick hack , especially for the feds in the audience.
If they follow protocol , they ' ll pick up the phone and say ,  " Hey , do you have the original ?  " 
We are harangued , lectured to , sold , marketed , but a letter is actually one of the few times that we have honest communication.
Get writing.
1222
So I ' m specifically interested in how we , as humans , relate to ourselves , each other and the world around us.
And so anytime I talk about what I do , I like to just quickly address the reason why bodies matter.
Don ' t be ashamed.
So I communicate through everything from radio transceivers to funnels and plastic tubing.
And so I was thinking about how it might be great if I could just take all these noises -- like all these sounds of my thoughts in my head -- if I could just physically extricate them and pull them out in such a form that I could share them with somebody else.
This one is called the Talk to Yourself Hat.
And so when I make these things , it ' s really not so much about the object itself , but rather the negative space around the object.
So many of these devices really kind of focus on the ways in which we relate to ourselves.
And so the Inflatable Heart is an external organ that can be used by the wearer to express themselves.
So the Discommunicator is a tool for arguments.
So even though I ' m really interested in the relationship between people , I also consider the ways in which we relate to the world around us.
So I made a wearable wall that I could wear as a backpack.
And so this really shifts the human/plant dynamic , because a single house plant can actually express its needs to thousands of people at the same time.
The glaciers are actually leaving us.
They actually have these buses that drive up and over the lateral moraine and drop people off on the surface of the glacier.
I really just don ' t even know how to say hello.
But really the most satisfying experience I ' ve had is the act of listening , which is what we need in any good relationship.
And so this is constructed out of a heat reflected material that serves to mediate the difference in temperature between the human body and the glacial ice.
And just as with the wall , how I wanted to be more wall-like , with this project , I ' d actually like to take more a of glacial pace.
Venice is sinking . To save it , Rachel Armstrong says we need to outgrow architecture made of inert materials and , well , make architecture that grows itself . She proposes a not-quite-alive material that does its own repairs and sequesters carbon , too.
All buildings today have something in common.
And that means that there is a one-way transfer of energy from our environment into our homes and cities.
Living systems are in constant conversation with the natural world , through sets of chemical reactions called metabolism.
But they don ' t exist . So I ' m having to make them.
Now , that ' s exactly the kind of process that I ' m interested in , when we ' re thinking about sustainable materials.
This little bag is able to conduct itself in a way that can only be described as living.
So here we are . These are protocells , patterning their environment.
This is a violent process.
So what we ' re trying to do is , we ' re trying to push these technologies towards creating bottom-up construction approaches for architecture , which contrast the current , Victorian , top-down methods which impose structure upon matter.
If you walk around the city of Oxford , where we are today , and have a look at the brickwork , which I ' ve enjoyed doing in the last couple of days , you ' ll actually see that a lot of it is made of limestone.
It looks beautiful.
Well , most likely it would . It might be able to grow.
So when we think about scaling up metabolic materials , we can start thinking about ecological interventions like repair of atolls , or reclamation of parts of a city that are damaged by water.
And architect Christian Kerrigan has come up with a series of designs that show us how it may be possible to actually grow a limestone reef underneath the city.
Now , this is the very interesting part.
We ' ve observed this in the laboratory.
And so here the protocells are depositing their limestone very specifically , around the foundations of Venice , effectively petrifying it.
An accretion itself is a huge sink of carbon dioxide.
This is terrestrial chemistry . We ' ve all got it , which means that this technology is just as appropriate for developing countries as it is for First World countries.
And finally , an observer in the future marveling at a beautiful structure in the environment may find it almost impossible to tell whether this structure has been created by a natural process or an artificial one.
Sebastian Thrun : Google ' s driverless car
And then I decided I ' d dedicate my life to saving one million people every year.
So we decided at Stanford to build a different self-driving car.
Yet I still hadn ' t saved a single life.
It ' s the perfect driving mechanism.
In fact , while we drove 140,000 miles , people didn ' t even notice.
What ? 
And do you realize that almost all of those are due to human error and not machine error , and can therefore be prevented by machines ? 
This is four billion hours wasted in this country alone.
With streams and rivers drying up because of over-usage , Rob Harmon has implemented an ingenious market mechanism to bring back the water . Farmers and beer companies find their fates intertwined in the intriguing century-old tale of Prickly Pear Creek.
This is a river.
On this map , the colored areas represent water conflicts.
They would ordinarily support fish and other wildlife.
It runs through a populated area from East Helena to Lake Helena.
Well , it started back in the late 1800s when people started settling in places like Montana.
Oddly , a lot of people showed up wanting to share the stream , and the folks who were there first got concerned enough to bring out their lawyers.
The problem is that all over the west now it looks like this.
So it ' s not just about the number of people ; the system itself creates a disincentive to conserve because you can lose your water right if you don ' t use it.
And I ' m sure you all know , this has created significant conflicts between the agricultural and environmental communities.
They ' re concerned about securing an adequate supply of water , they ' re trying to be really efficient with their water use , and they ' re concerned about how their water use affects the image of their brand.
Now the brewers in Montana have already done a lot to reduce their water consumption , but they still use millions of gallons of water.
After all , there ' s a strong correlation between water and fishing , and for some , there ' s a strong correlation between fishing and beer.
Up until now , business water stewardship has been limited to measuring and reducing , and we ' re suggesting that the next step is to restore.
In some states , senior water rights holders can leave their water in-stream while legally protecting it from others and maintaining their water right.
We pay them to leave their water in-stream.
Because he ' s the senior water rights holder , he can protect the water from other users in the stream.
We then take the measured water , we divide it into thousand-gallon increments.
After 140 years of conflict and 100 years of dry streams , a circumstance that litigation and regulation has not solved , we put together a market-based , willing buyer , willing seller solution -- a solution that does not require litigation.
And they provide needed economic support for rural communities.
And when we make these connections , we can and we do turn this into this.

He looks like this.
And you do that by measuring the relative activation of the left prefrontal cortex in the fMRI , versus the right prefrontal cortex.
Perhaps something very naughty.
My dream is to create the conditions for world peace in my lifetime -- and to do that by creating the conditions for inner peace and compassion on a global scale.
Compassion is fun.
Therefore , to create the conditions for global compassion , all we have to do is to reframe compassion as something that is fun.
Then , every boss , every manager in the world , will want to have compassion -- like this.
Because what I was looking for was right in front of my eyes -- in Google , my company.
And maybe because of that , compassion is organic and widespread company-wide.
And they don ' t usually ask for permission ; they just go ahead and do it , and then other Googlers join in , and it just gets bigger and bigger.
The first example is the largest annual community event -- where Googlers from around the world donate their labor to their local communities -- was initiated and organized by three employees before it became official , because it just became too big.
And they raise enough money to build this hospital -- the first hospital of its kind for 200,000 people.
There is so much organic social action all around Google that the company decided to form a social responsibility team just to support these efforts.
So it turns out that Google is a compassionate company , because Googlers found compassion to be fun.
The first benefit of compassion is that it creates highly effective business leaders.
And there is a motivational component , which is ,  " I want to help you. " 
These are leaders who , in addition to being highly capable , possess two important qualities , and they are humility and ambition.
And if you look at these qualities in the context of compassion , we find that the cognitive and affective components of compassion -- understanding people and empathizing with people -- inhibits , tones down , what I call the excessive self-obsession that ' s in us , therefore creating the conditions for humility.
The second compelling benefit of compassion is that it creates an inspiring workforce.
It ' s like how can you not be inspired by those people -- your own coworkers ? 
In our experience , there are three ingredients.
This awareness of serving the greater good is very self-inspiring and it creates fertile ground for compassion to grow in.
And one of our most popular managers jokes that , this is what he says ,  " Google is a place where the inmates run the asylum. " 
Leadership training in Google , for example , places a lot of emphasis on the inner qualities , such as self-awareness , self-mastery , empathy and compassion , because we believe that leadership begins with character.
What a company.
Attention is the basis of all higher cognitive and emotional abilities.
The second step follows the first step.
And once you can do that , you create the kind of self-knowledge that enables self-mastery.
I want you to be happy. " 
And this also creates the conditions for compassion in the workplace.
If you want to be happy , practice compassion. " 
Political prisoners aren ' t the only ones being tortured -- the vast majority of judicial torture happens in ordinary cases , even in  ' functioning '  legal systems . Social activist Karen Tse shows how we can , and should , stand up and end the use of routine torture.
In 1994 , I walked into a prison in Cambodia , and I met a 12-year-old boy who had been tortured and was denied access to counsel.
What I also realized at that point was that it was not only Cambodia , but of the 113 developing countries that torture , 93 of these countries have all passed laws that say you have a right to a lawyer and you have a right not to be tortured.
I believe today that it is possible for us as a world community , if we make a decision , to come together and end torture as an investigative tool in our lifetime , but it will require three things.
So in the year 2000 , I began to wonder , what if we came together ? 
And even 20 years later , there was only 10 lawyers in the country , so consequently you ' d walk into a prison and not only would you meet 12-year-old boys , you ' d meet women and you ' d say ,  " Why are you here ?  "  Women would say ,  " Well I ' ve been here for 10 years because my husband committed a crime , but they can ' t find him. " 
She said ,  " I have defended more than a hundred people , and I ' ve never had to do any investigation , because they all come with confessions. " 
But one day the perfect case came , and it was a woman who was a vegetable seller , she was sitting outside of a house.
And the defenders began to take cases over and over again and you will see , they have step by step began to change the course of history in Cambodia.
But it is in so many countries.
And she said  " Yeah , but she ' s why I ' m here, "  because she was accused of stealing two diapers and an iron for her baby and still had been in prison.
So lawyers began to courageously stand up together to organize a system where they can take cases.
And then he said ,  " But I want you to know that the lack of resources is never an excuse for injustice. " 
And I said ,  " But there ' s been tens of millions of dollars that have recently gone in to the development of the legal system here.
I said ,  " I ' m gonna copy this. " 
And after a pause , they said ,  " They had been tortured. " 
And there are many reasons why I believe it ' s possible.
So it ' s an online contest where it ' s only five thousand dollars if you come up with and innovative way of implementing justice.
And I was sitting side by side with one of our very courageous lawyers , and said ,  " How can we get this out ?  How can we make sure that this is implemented ? 
We need to systematically implement early access to counsel.
And the reason that I think that those words are interesting is because those were the same kinds of words that were used for people who decided they would end slavery , or end apartheid.
I end always , because I ' m sure the questions are -- and I ' d be happy to talk to you at any point --  " But what can I really do ?  " 
So he would come to the first bar , the second bar and then the third bar , and then really slowly move his head so he could fit through , and come back , third , second , first . And he would grab my pinkie , because what he wanted to do every day is he wanted to go visit.
He was born in a prison with almost nothing , no material goods , but he had a sense of his own heroic journey , which I believe we are all born into . He said ,  " Probably I can ' t do everything.
Thank you.

I think of heaven as a really comfortable cloud where I can just lie down with my belly down , like I was watching TV when I was a child , and my elbows up.
it took me a while to understand it , but when I discovered around 24 years of age that I was much more comfortable with objects than with people , I finally decided to really embrace this passion.
That was one of the funnest moments of my career.
And of course , you can imagine , with Humble Masterpieces it was the same thing multiplied by a hundred.
Instead of having a tray with two peas , I was hoping that they would go into the kitchen cabinet or the mother ' s handbag and do their museum-quality design collection on a tray.
For instance , I didn ' t know that the Spaniards invented the mop , but they were very proud so every Spaniard said  " la frego. "  And Italians did the pizza.
But an exhibition like that made me understand even more what I ' ve been thinking of for 13 years ever since I got to MoMA.
In Italy , in Milan especially , contemporary art really doesn ' t have that much of a place.
And New York has another kind of knack for contemporary art.
They think of somebody choosing fabrics.
They tried to make a toddler ' s gas mask in such a way that the toddler can be held by the parent because proximity of the body is so important.
I ' m very well aware that 80 percent of my public is there to see Picasso and Matisse , and then they stumble upon my show and I keep them there.
There were a lot of programs in architecture and design that were about pointing people in the direction of a better design for a better life.
And at the same time , the gorgeous work of Takeshi Ishiguro , who did these beautiful salt-and-pepper containers that are made of rice dough.
It was beautiful -- it was called Personal Skies.
What they do best is make a synthesis of human needs , current conditions in economy , in materials , in sustainability issues , and then what they do at the end -- if they are good -- is much more than the sum of its parts.
Yeah , that ' s particularly gorgeous -- it ' s the TV dinner of 2001.
I came to the United States 13 years ago , and to this day I have to ask ,  " What does that mean ?  " 
So , Safe is the last exhibition that I did at MoMA and it ended at the beginning of last year.
But it ranged from such items as a complete de-mining equipment to these kind of water-sterilizing straws , so it was really wide-ranging.
This is a beautiful project by Ralph Borland , who ' s South African.
So , designers sometimes don ' t do things that are immediately functional , but they ' re functional to our understanding of issues.
They are athletic gear for Muslim women that enable them to ski , play tennis , do whatever they want to do without having to uncap themselves.
They range from this fluffy toy that is about hugging you -- because autistic children like to be hugged tight , so it has a spring inside -- all the way to this doll with a mirror so the child can see him or herself in the mirror and regain a sense of self.
And the truth is that there are very different kinds of luxury , and there ' s luxury that is relative for people that don ' t have that much.
And here is the work of two brothers from Sao Paulo , Fernando and Humberto Campana , who got inspired by the poverty and smartness that they saw around them to do pieces of furniture that now are selling for an enormous amount of money.
This is a whole series of furniture that wants to engage you physically.
Many years ago I heard a mathematician from Vienna , whose name was Marchetti , explain how the innovation in the military industry -- therefore , secret innovation -- and the innovation in the civilian society are two sinusoids that are kind of opposed.
Many of you might know that the Potato Chip Chair by Charles and Ray Eames comes exactly from that kind of instance : fiberglass was available for civilian use all of a sudden.
And that ' s why designers , more and more , are working on behaviors rather than on objects.
For instance , this is a beautiful container for asthma medicine that kind of inflates itself when it ' s time for you to take the medicine , so the child has to go -- pffff! -- to release and relieve the container itself.
I ' m trying to find not the metaphors , but , rather , the points in common -- the common gripes , the common issues , the common preoccupations -- and I think that it will enable us to go a little further in this idea of design as an instruction , as a direction rather than a prescription of form.

So , Africa is a complex continent full of contradictions , as you can see.
Just think about that , you know ? 
And some of you might be standing here thinking , saying ,  " OK , you know , Ory , you ' re Harvard-educated , and all you privileged people come here , saying ,  ' Forget the poor people.
We start with poverty.
You know , when things were good , we had eggs and sausages.
And they adopted a very interesting approach to education , which was they were going to take me to a school that they can barely afford.
And I remember thinking , I mean , why don ' t these guys just take me to a cheap school ? 
In Kenya , we have an entrance exam to go into high school.
And I was so disappointed , and I was like ,  " Oh my God , you know , what am I going to do ?  " 
So we went to the school , and because we were nobodies , and because we didn ' t have privilege , and because my father didn ' t have the right last name , he was treated like dirt.
And there ' s nothing worse than seeing your parent being humiliated in front of you , you know ? 
Disease.
And I was in the States at the time , and they called me . He was very sick , the first time he got sick.
But they were like , you know , this is a long-term thing.
He had to be on that pill for the rest of his life.
And that kept him going.
The hospital put him on a water drip for three days.
And , you know , now , imagine if -- and I could go on and on -- imagine if this is all you know about me.
This is the damage it causes.
Because we talk about it in big terms , and you wonder , you know , so what ? 
And you didn ' t know about the windmill , you know ? 
I was like Nike should hire him , you know ,  " Just do it! " 
First of all , Africans , we need to get better at telling our stories.
Afrigator is an aggregator of African blogs that was developed in South Africa.
Swahili is spoken by about 50 million people in East Africa.
He ' s the only African who ' s contributing to this.
Why are we not generating our own content ? 
The cheetah generation.
But the point I ' m trying to make , though , is that it ' s not enough for us to criticize.
And I can ' t emphasize that enough , you know.
And because I ' m needed here , you know ? 
I ' m a corporate lawyer most of the time for an organization called Enablis that supports entrepreneurs in South Africa.
My partner , M , who ' s a tech guru , hacked WordPress.
And you can get profiles of each MP , questions they ' ve asked in parliament.
You know , I believe that accountability stems from demand.
You know , they ' re not going to change just out of nowhere.
They come from us.
Where do we go from here ? 
The other thing I want to urge you to do is take an interest in the individual.
Give me something I can do with Paypal. " 
My sister was struggling to get through undergrad.
A cousin of mine died of AIDS , left an orphan , so we said , well , what are we going to do with her ? 
An example . This man changed my life.
I was taking a class of his , and he was just like , this is an overeager student , which we don ' t normally get in the United States , because everyone else is cynical and jaded.
And he tried to talk me out of it , but it was like ,  " OK , I know nothing about applying to law school , I ' m poli-sci Ph.D.
So I ' m like ,  " Yeah , I ' m just applying to Pitt for law school. " 
And , you know , so he took me under his wing , and he encouraged me.
And this is just an illustration.
Basically , I want to end with my vision for Africa , you know ? 
That ' s one thing you Americans take for granted , you know ? 
I would like to see that change , and the change starts with us.

I ' ve always liked to build stuff.
In fact , in 2009 , I was even more clueless.
I was lucky enough that I visited Mumbai , my house , back for a vacation.
He ' s a doctor there.
I was waiting , and when he did emerge , he was ashen-faced.
What was really shocking for me was that he said that this is entirely due to undiagnosed anemia.
So why was this woman dying ? 
And I knew that there had to be a way to prevent this.
This is a $10,000 machine which was available in Mumbai.
Now this struck me as -- I love to fix things . I wanted to fix this.
You saw the woman there , the nurse.
Public health care runs on the ASHA worker , not the doctor.
It had to be simple enough for that woman ASHA worker to use.
But , but it didn ' t work.
And I have it here in my purse.
This will help ASHA workers diagnose anemia at the point of care.
And we essentially pass light right through the tissue , and from understanding how much of it is transmitted , how much of it is scattered and how much of it is absorbed , we can figure out how much hemoglobin is there in the blood.
There ' s a bunch of very exciting stuff which we are doing.
You ' ll notice , of course , that there are hot spots -- South Asia , Africa.
And by the time I ' m done , in 2020 , when the WHO publishes the data again , this is going to be the map of anemia.
1391
And I actually didn ' t leave my house for about three days.
I said ,  " Thanks . I feel really -- I ' m not functioning. " 
I had a slide that said Breakdown.
It was a little different than what you usually do.
And we ' re going to be talking about 600 , 700 people. " 
And I said ,  " Do you remember when we were in college and really wild and kind of dumb ?  " 
And she goes ,  " Uh .. . no. " 
Why did you bring this up ?  Have you lost your mind ? 
She said ,  " You ' re like the worst vulnerability role model ever. " 
And my life did end when that happened.
The first is vulnerability is not weakness.
The majority of people.
It fuels our daily lives.
We ' d like you to come in and speak.
This is mostly , to be honest with you , from the business sector : innovation , creativity and change.
Adaptability to change is all about vulnerability.
I ' ll give you an example.
Our family motto is  " Lock and load. " 
I turn around , I go ,  " Hi. " 
And I ' m so worn out at this point in my life , I look at her and I actually say ,  " It was a frickin '  spiritual awakening. " 
So when I became Vulnerability TED , like an action figure -- like Ninja Barbie , but I ' m Vulnerability TED -- I thought , I ' m going to leave that shame stuff behind , because I spent six years studying shame before I really started writing and talking about vulnerability.
And I see you.
And so I want to walk you in to shame.
It is to put on some galoshes and walk through and find our way around.
Yes ? 
You can ' t fix that problem without addressing shame , because when they teach those folks how to suture , they also teach them how to stitch their self-worth to being all-powerful.
I saw the TED Fellows my first day here.
And everybody just burst into applause , and they were like  " Yes! " 
I can ' t wait to tell people this.
You know why this place is amazing ? 
I don ' t think the world understands that because of shame.
It is not the man who sits and points out how the doer of deeds could have done things better and how he falls and stumbles.
That ' s what life is about , about daring greatly , about being in the arena.
I know your dad really wasn ' t in Luxembourg , he was in Sing Sing.
Shame is that thing.
The thing to understand about shame is it ' s not guilt.
How many of you , if you did something that was hurtful to me , would be willing to say ,  " I ' m sorry . I made a mistake ?  " 
There ' s a huge difference between shame and guilt.
Guilt , inversely correlated with those things.
If shame washes over me and washes over Chris , it ' s going to feel the same.
So I would opt for , yes , you have a little shame.
For women , shame is do it all , do it perfectly and never let them see you sweat.
For men , shame is not a bunch of competing , conflicting expectations.
And it wasn ' t until a man looked at me one day after a book signing , said ,  " I love what you have to say about shame , I ' m curious why you didn ' t mention men. " 
And he said ,  " Because you say to reach out , tell our story , be vulnerable.
When we reach out and be vulnerable we get the shit beat out of us.
You show me a man who can sit with a woman who ' s just had it , she can ' t do it all anymore , and his first response is not ,  " I unloaded the dishwasher, "  but he really listens -- because that ' s all we need -- I ' ll show you a guy who ' s done a lot of work.
He asked , what do women need to do to conform to female norms ? 
If you put shame in a Petri dish , it needs three things to grow exponentially : secrecy , silence and judgment.
If we ' re going to find our way back to each other , vulnerability is going to be that path.
And even if you got as perfect as you could and as bulletproof as you could possibly muster when you got in there , that ' s not what we want to see.
So thank you all very much . I really appreciate it.

They fly , not with rotating components , so they fly only by flapping their wings.
There are generalists and also specialists in the field of aerodynamics in the field of building gliders.
So why do we do all this ? 
So we can now look at the SmartBird.
And it is all out of carbon fiber.
we have the possibility to fly like a bird.
We have a split wing.
So therefore , it rises up from passive torsion to active torsion , from 30 percent up to 80 percent.
Bruno Giussani : Markus , I think that we should fly it once more.

It really is a story of Dr . Venkataswamy.
I couldn ' t thread a needle or see the lice in my hair.
And the irony is that they don ' t need to be.
So this is the context in which Aravind came into existence about 30 years back as a post-retirement project of Dr . V.
And then more recently we started managing hospitals in other parts of the country and also setting up hospitals in other parts of the world as well.
And then doing this day-in and day-out , and doing it well , requires a lot of inspiration and a lot of hard work.
Doctor , whatever you say , I accept it.
It is ourselves we are helping.
Dr . V : See , McDonald ' s '  concept is simple.
Dr . V : Supposing I ' m able to produce eye care , techniques , methods , all in the same way , and make it available in every corner of the world.
And , of course , the challenge was that it ' s a huge problem , we are talking of millions of people , very little resource to deal with it , and then lots of logistics and affordability issues.
And then , with all these results , the doctor makes a final diagnosis , and then prescribes a line of treatment , and if they need a pair of glasses , they are available right there at the camp site , usually under a tree.
They receive surgery the following day , and then they will stay for a day or two , and then they are put back on the buses to be taken back to where they came from , and where their families will be waiting to take them back home.
So we had to do something different , so we set up what we call primary eye care centers , vision centers.
The effect of this has been that , within the first year , we really had a 40 percent penetration in the market that it served , which is over 50,000 people.
We fixed the pricing , taking into account what they would save in bus fare in coming to a city , so they pay about 20 rupees , and that ' s good for three consultations.
The other aspect is how do you deal with this efficiently when you have very few ophthalmologists ? 
And then we focused on village girls that we recruited , and then they really are the backbone of the organization.
So , putting all this together , what really happened was the productivity of our staff was significantly higher than anyone else.
So what we did was , we gave away a lot of it for free , and then those who pay , I mean , they paid local market rates , nothing more , and often much less.
The result has been , over the years , the expenditure has increased with volumes.
And what we did was a couple of very counter-intuitive things.
The other part was how do you address this increase in cost of technology ? 
To conclude , I mean , what we do , does it have a broader relevance , or is it just India or developing countries ? 
And then we train about 50 ophthalmologists against the 70 trained by them , comparable quality , both in training and in patient care.
I think there is more to it.
Another insight , which , again , I want to leave with you , in conditions where the problem is very large , which cuts across all economic strata , where we have a good solution , I think the process I described , you know , productivity , quality , patient-centered care , can give an answer , and there are many which fit this paradigm.
Now , how do you make people own the problem , want to do something about it ? 
Dr . V : When you grow in spiritual consciousness , we identify with all that is in the world so there is no exploitation.
http://www.ted.com/talks/fabian_hemmert_the_shape_shifting_future_of_the_mobile_phone.html
Fabian Hemmert : The shape-shifting future of the mobile phone
On the other hand , we humans , we live in a physical world.
If you look at the iPhone with its touch and the Wii with its bodily activity , you can see the tendency ; it ' s getting physical.
As humans , we are sensitive to where an object in our hand is heavy.
We shift the gravitational center of it.
It can tell you by its weight ,  " Okay , move right . Walk ahead . Make a left here. " 
So if I download an e-book and it has 20 pages -- well , they could be thin , right -- but if it has 500 pages , I want to feel that  " Harry Potter "  -- it ' s thick.
For example , it can be thin in your pocket , which we of course want it to be ; but then if you hold it in your hand , it can lean towards you , be thick.
It ' s fairly simple.
And you can feel that because it ' s thicker at that edge.
Wouldn ' t that be a way to make mobile phones more intuitive ? 
So , once again , mobile phone-shaped box , but this one , it has a breath and a heartbeat , and it feels very organic.
You give it a pat behind the ears , and everything is all right again.
What ' s behind that is a postulation , namely that not humans should get much more technical in the future ; rather than that , technology , a bit more human.

When I started using the wheelchair , it was a tremendous new freedom.
Just being out on the street was exhilarating.
When I asked people their associations with the wheelchair , they used words like  " limitation, "   " fear, "   " pity "  and  " restriction. " 
As a result , I knew I needed to make my own stories about this experience , new narratives to reclaim my identity.
When I literally started leaving traces of my joy and freedom , it was exciting to see the interested and surprised responses from people.
So I thought ,  " I wonder what ' ll happen if I put the two together ?  " 
I literally have the freedom to move in 360 degrees of space and an ecstatic experience of joy and freedom.
And I think that moment of completely new thought perhaps creates a freedom that spreads to the rest of other people ' s lives.
And the other thing is , that because nobody ' s seen or heard of an underwater wheelchair before , and creating this spectacle is about creating new ways of seeing , being and knowing , now you have this concept in your mind.

When I was a small boy , I took my pledge as an American , to save and faithfully defend from waste the natural resources of my country , its air , soil and minerals , its forests , waters and wildlife.
And then worked for the Jerry Brown administration.
This year , Whole Earth Catalog has a supplement that I ' ll preview today , called Whole Earth Discipline.
The developing world now has all of the biggest cities , and they are developing three times faster than the developed countries , and nine times bigger.
Well we now have a distribution of urban power similar to what we had 1,000 years ago.
Well , what ' s going on is the villages of the world are emptying out.
I used to have a very romantic idea about villages , and it ' s because I never lived in one.
There is plenty going on.
They even build their own infrastructure.
It is not the case that slums undermine prosperity , not the working slums ; they help create prosperity.
And that ' s how they work.
Famine mostly is a rural event now.
And they are helping each other solve these issues.
The answer is ,  " Everything. " 
The main event is , these are not people crushed by poverty.
The informal economy , it ' s sort of like dark energy in astrophysics : it ' s not supposed to be there , but it ' s huge.
There ' s all kinds of activity.
Education is more possible in the cities , and that changes the world.
In this case , supply right next to demand.
Connectivity between the city and the country is what ' s going to keep the country good , because the city has interesting ways of doing things.
And those who remain in the village can shift over to cash crops to send food to the new growing markets in town.
The numbers are considerable . A billion live in the squatter cities now.
Now , for us environmentalists , maybe the greenest thing about the cities is they diffuse the population bomb.
Very interesting side effect here , here ' s a slide from Phillip Longman.
What you ' re getting is a world which is old folks , and old cities , going around doing things the old way , in the north.
The climate news , I ' m sorry to say , is going to keep getting worse than we think , faster than we think.
From your standpoint this means a great increase in climate refugees over the coming decades , and what goes along with that , which is resource wars and chaos wars , as we ' re seeing in Darfur.
Baseload electricity is what it takes to run a city , or a city planet.
And everyone will keep burning it because it ' s so cheap , until governments make it expensive.
Because remember , this is what drives the prosperity in the developing world in the villages and in the cities.
And it puts 18 thousand tons of carbon dioxide in the air.
That ' s where you see some of the source , not from my fellow environmentalists , but from people who feel threatened by nuclear power.
I want to point out one interesting thing , which is that environmentalists like the thing we call micropower.
And they ' re selling these floating reactors , only 35 megawatts , to developing countries.
Here ' s an American design from Lawrence Livermore Lab.
And the innovation is moving very rapidly.
Half of that is coming from dismantled warheads from Russia , soon to be joined by our dismantled warheads.
My fellow environmentalists , on this subject , have been irrational , anti-scientific , and very harmful.
And they increase yield , which allows you to have your agricultural area be smaller , and therefore more wild area is freed up.
The Nuffield Council on Bioethics met on this issue twice in great detail and said it is a moral imperative to make genetically engineered crops readily available.
There will be events , like 35,000 people dying of a heat wave , which happened a while back.
But there ' s this little problem with geoengineering : what body is going to decide who gets to engineer ?  How much they do ?  Where they do it ? 
You geoengineer your way . We ' ll geoengineer our way. " 
Here is an example that climatologists like a lot , one of the dozens of geoengineering ideas.
That ' s nothing , compared to all of the other things we may be trying to do about energy.
Nobel Prize-winning climatologist Paul Crutzen calls our geological era the Anthropocene , the human-dominated era . We are stuck with its obligations.
Days before this talk , journalist Naomi Klein was on a boat in the Gulf of Mexico , looking at the catastrophic results of BP ' s risky pursuit of oil . Our societies have become addicted to extreme risk in finding new energy , new financial instruments and more .. . and too often , we ' re left to clean up a mess afterward . Klein ' s question : What ' s the backup plan ? 
I just did something I ' ve never done before.
The scientists I was with were not studying the effect of the oil and dispersants on the big stuff -- the birds , the turtles , the dolphins , the glamorous stuff.
It ' s still working its way up the food chain.
But they forgot this : the fact that birds dine on grubs , that robins eat lots of worms now saturated with DDT.
And I think what it is is I don ' t think we have fully come to terms with the meaning of this disaster , with what it meant to witness a hole ripped in our world , with what it meant to watch the contents of the Earth gush forth on live TV , 24 hours a day , for months.
And BP was hardly our first experience of this in recent years.
And when it inevitably does , the best and the brightest reach for the financial equivalent of the junk shot -- in this case , throwing massive amounts of much-needed public money down a very different kind of hole.
Now a far more relevant question -- as MIT physicist Evelyn Fox Keller puts it -- is ,  " What if those scientists are right ?  " 
But climate policy in the wealthy world -- to the extent that such a thing exists -- is not based on precaution , but rather on cost-benefit analysis -- finding the course of action that economists believe will have the least impact on our GDP.
Can we go with two degrees , three degrees , or -- where we ' re currently going -- four degrees Celsius ?  " 
So once again , why do we take these crazy risks with the precious ? 
And greed and hubris are intimately intertwined when it comes to recklessness.
Now both of these options -- the boy genius and the scammer -- are going to make you vastly overconfident and therefore more prone to taking even bigger risks in the future.
Putting fear of failure out of your mind can be a very good thing if you ' re training for a triathlon or preparing to give a TEDTalk , but personally , I think people with the power to detonate our economy and ravage our ecology would do better having a picture of Icarus hanging from the wall , because -- maybe not that one in particular -- but I want them thinking about the possibility of failure all of the time.
The flipside of this is that constantly being told that you are gifted , chosen and born to rule has distinct societal downsides.
Whether we actively believe them or consciously reject them , our culture remains in the grips of certain archetypal stories about our supremacy over others and over nature -- the narrative of the newly discovered frontier and the conquering pioneer , the narrative of manifest destiny , the narrative of apocalypse and salvation.
And I ' m not just showing it to pick on Motorola -- that ' s just a bonus.
There ' s another one , equally important , about how that very same Mother Nature is so nurturing and so resilient that we can never make a dent in her abundance.
In other words , the ocean is big ; she can take it.
A new technology will come along to fix the messes we made with the last one.
The Earth always did have limits.
Not only do we continue to tell and retell the same tired stories , but we are now doing so with a frenzy and a fury that , frankly , verges on camp.
Ignore those creeping fears that we have finally hit the wall.
Now , would that this were just about Sarah Palin and her reality TV show.
So that means drilling for oil in the deepest water , including the icy Arctic seas , where a clean-up may simply be impossible.
It ' s worth taking a moment to understand this practice , because I believe it speaks to recklessness and the path we ' re on like little else.
Tar sand ' s oil is solid , mixed in with the soil.
That ' s very bad news for local indigenous people living downstream who are reporting alarmingly high cancer rates.
My point is that this is not oil drilling.
Now I should confess that as [far as] I ' m concerned this would be an abomination if it emitted not one particle of carbon.
This is where our story of endless growth has taken us , to this black hole at the center of my country -- a place of such planetary pain that , like the BP gusher , one can only stand to look at it for so long.
But , of course , our secular religion is technology.
So , solving the problem of pollution with more pollution.
Nevertheless , the mere mention of geoengineering is being greeted in some circles , particularly media circles , with a relief tinged with euphoria.
You see , for some people , their savior is a guy in a flowing robe.
We need stories that replace that linear narrative of endless growth with circular narratives that remind us that what goes around comes around.
http://www.ted.com/talks/john_graham_cumming_the_greatest_machine_that_never_was.html
John Graham-Cumming : The greatest machine that never was
If you know anything about the history of computers , you will know that in the  ' 30s and the  ' 40s , simple computers were created that started the computer revolution we have today , and you would be correct , except for you ' d have the wrong century.
Now , I have a great affinity for Charles Babbage because his hair is always completely unkempt like this in every single picture.
He held the post that Newton held at Cambridge , and that was recently held by Stephen Hawking.
I ' ll spend a fortune on it . I ' ve got a better idea.
Every one of these circles is a cog , a stack of cogs , and this thing is as big as a steam locomotive.
Imagine a thing this high of cogs , hundreds and hundreds of them , and they ' ve got numbers on them.
The memory is this bit over here.
Completely mechanical . This whole machine is mechanical.
It could compute . It couldn ' t just calculate . It could do more.
If you ' ve ever seen an electron microscope picture , you ' ll see this . This all looks the same , then there ' s this bit over here which is incredibly complicated.
Now , the reason they used punch cards was that Jacquard , in France , had created the Jacquard loom , which was weaving these incredible patterns controlled by punch cards , so he was just repurposing the technology of the day , and like everything else he did , he ' s using the technology of his era , so 1830s , 1840s , 1850s , cogs , steam , mechanical devices . Ironically , born the same year as Charles Babbage was Michael Faraday , who would completely revolutionize everything with the dynamo , transformers , all these sorts of things.
You ' ve got punch cards , a CPU and memory.
You know , just stop for a moment , imagine all those noises , this thing ,  " Click , clack click click click, "  steam engine ,  " Ding, "  right ? 
It prints just numbers , because he was obsessed with numbers , but it does print onto paper , and it even does word wrapping , so if you get to the end of the line , it goes around like that.
Along comes this woman , Ada Lovelace.
Because of course , there ' s never been a mathematician that ' s gone crazy , so , you know , that ' ll be fine.
Now , some people call her the first programmer.
Rather than just being a programmer , she saw something that Babbage didn ' t.
Whether it ' s video or text or music or voice , it ' s all numbers , it ' s all , underlying it , mathematical functions happening , and Lovelace said ,  " Just because you ' re doing mathematical functions and symbols doesn ' t mean these things can ' t represent other things in the real world , such as music. " 
Now , a hundred years later , this guy comes along , Alan Turing , and in 1936 , and invents the computer all over again.
He laid down the mathematical foundations for computer science , and said ,  " It doesn ' t matter how you make a computer. " 
This is called the Church–Turing thesis.
It used punch cards , which were being fed in , and it ran about 10,000 times slower the first ZX81.
So there are plans.
The project has a number of parts to it.
When it ' s built , you ' ll finally be able to understand how a computer works , because rather than having a tiny chip in front of you , you ' ve got to look at this humongous thing and say ,  " Ah , I see the memory operating , I see the CPU operating , I hear it operating . I probably smell it operating. " 
Now , I ' ll just give you a little taste of what it looks like in motion with a video which shows just one part of the CPU mechanism working.

Richard Resnick : Welcome to the genomic revolution
Women have two copies of that big X chromosome ; men have the X and , of course , that small copy of the Y.
Is that a big number ? 
And perhaps because of its size , a group of people -- all , by the way , with Y chromosomes -- decided they would want to sequence it.
It costs about a dollar for each base -- a very slow way of doing it.
And so just to give you a picture of what this looks like , the Human Genome Project : 3 gigabases , right.
That ' s the equivalent of you filling up your car with gas in 1998 , waiting until 2011 , and now you can drive to Jupiter and back twice.
And we know this based on the machines that are being placed.
The Chinese are absolutely winning this race to the new Moon , by the way.
She is treated with surgery , chemotherapy and radiation.
She comes back three years later at age 42 with more ovarian cancer , more chemotherapy.
And it ' s because of people like my colleague , Rick Wilson , at the Genome Institute at Washington University , who decided to take a look at this woman postmortem.
So unfortunately , this doesn ' t help this woman , but it does have severe , profound if you will , implications to her family.
What they had was dopa-responsive dystonia.
They ' re one of the two companies that makes these massive whole genome sequencing tools.
Guys , this would never have happened without whole genome sequencing.
That ' s how fast this is moving.
So a hundred surgeries later , he looks at his mom and says ,  " Mom , please pray for me . I ' m in so much pain. " 
But the gene that regulates that down is broken.
Today , it ' s here.
Now look , as long as we continue to increase the population , we ' re going to have to continue to grow and eat genetically modified foods , and that ' s the only position that I ' ll take today.
And in fact , the typewriter was essentially deleted by this thing.
And suddenly we had Netscape , and we had Yahoo and we had , indeed , the entire dotcom bubble.
So what I ' d like you to consider is : What does it mean when these dots don ' t represent the individual bases of your genome , but they connect to genomes all across the planet ? 
But what would have happened if I had said C ? 
Personalized genomic massage anyone ? 
Now think of it , it ' s 2016 and the leading candidate releases not only her four years of back tax returns , but also her personal genome.
Do you think it would have helped John McCain ? 
So my father ' s father was one of 10 Resnick brothers.
But imagine if my genome were deidentified , sitting in software , and a third cousin ' s genome was also sitting there , and there was software that could compare these two and make these associations.
Now this is probably a good thing , right ? 
Okay , so experts think that one to three percent of you are not actually the father of your child.

Daniel Kraft invents a better way to harvest bone marrow
So , a few years ago , I ' m doing my transplant fellowship at Stanford.
Well we have a whole O.R . team , general anesthesia , nurses , and another doctor across from me.
Hands it back to me . And we do that again and again.
And there is probably a better way to do this.
Our standard see-through patient.
We can do multiple passes through that same entry.
And played around with this a little bit.
This device was just FDA approved in the last year.
And we got , again , about three to six times more stem cells than the standard approach done on the same patient.
Adult stem cells are throughout our body , including the blood-forming stem cells in our bone marrow , which we ' ve been using as a form of stem-cell therapy for over 40 years.
It may encourage more people to sign up to be potential live-saving bone marrow donors.

Garrett Lisi on his theory of everything
Coral is a very beautiful and unusual animal.
We can ask how exactly he got to be in this particular location compared to his neighbors -- if it was just chance , or destiny , or what ? 
That he was in all these other locations as well , but experiencing them as separate individuals.
And it tells us our reality is continually branching into different possibilities , just like a coral.
In this setup , Schrödinger is in a box with a radioactive sample that , by the laws of quantum mechanics , branches into a state in which it is radiated and a state in which it is not.
As far as either can tell , the other one doesn ' t exist.
It can be summed up in a single sentence : Everything that can happen , does.
What physics tells us is that everything comes down to geometry and the interactions of elementary particles.
This energy is immediately converted into a spray of subatomic particles , with detectors and computers used to figure out their properties.
But physics does tell us what particles can be produced.
It ' s going to push this energy limit seven times beyond what ' s ever been done before , so we ' re going to get to see some new particles very soon.
A lot of people in this room make a good living pushing them around.
These familiar particles also have less familiar second and third generations , which have the same charges as the first but have much higher masses.
The strong force acts between quarks which carry a different kind of charge , called color charge , and come in three different varieties : red , green and blue.
These four different forces interact with matter according to the corresponding charges that each particle has.
And I ' m going to show you one beautiful possibility towards the end of this talk.
But if we plot them out according to their charges , some beautiful patterns emerge.
These particles also have anti-particles , which have opposite charges.
This is called the Unified Electroweak Model , and it was put together back in 1967.
Since this massive Higgs sits along the horizontal direction in this diagram , the photons of electromagnetism remain massless and interact with electric charge along the vertical direction in this charge space.
Whenever particles interact , nature keeps things in a perfect balance along all four of these charge directions.
In further interactions , the charges must always balance.
They tell us what interactions are allowed to happen.
But these four charges corresponding to three forces are not the end of the story.
We can rotate this pattern in six dimensions , and see that it ' s quite pretty.
From this pattern , we already know the particle physics of these tiny scales . The way the universe works with these tiny scales is very beautiful.
And we want to use this picture to predict new particles that we ' ll see when experiments reach higher energies.
If we guess wisely , we can construct the standard charges in six charge dimensions as a broken symmetry of this more perfect pattern in seven charge dimensions.
A physicist looks for larger , more symmetric patterns that include the established pattern as a subset.
These particles are not uniquely identified by their six charges.
Here we can see the second and third generations of matter now related to the first generation by a symmetry called  " triality. " 
Each point in this pattern corresponds to a symmetry of this very complex and beautiful shape.
As we spin it , we can see many of the other intricate patterns contained in this one.
From their location in this pattern , we know that these new particles should be scalar fields like the Higgs particle , but have color charge and interact with the strong force.
It ' s a fantastic prospect that this object of great mathematical beauty could describe the truth of particle interactions at the smallest scales imaginable.
I believe this to be true , and I ' ve tried to follow Galileo ' s guidance in describing the mathematics of particle physics using only triangles , circles and other geometrical figures.
And as more of the pattern comes into view using new machines like the Large Hadron Collider , we may be able to see whether nature uses this E8 pattern or a different one.
And , of course , bad for me personally.
This theory and others like it are long shots.
As with any large investment , it can be emotionally difficult to abandon a line of research when it isn ' t working out.
I try to balance my life equally between physics , love and surfing -- my own three charge directions.
Now it ' s one of the greatest mysteries in the universe to my parents how I managed to survive all that time without engaging in anything resembling full-time employment.
And you may have noticed that these beautiful views are similar , but in slightly different places.
Living a nomadic existence has been hard at times , but it ' s allowed me to live in beautiful places and keep a balance in my life that I ' ve been happy with.
Chris Anderson : I probably understood two percent of that , but I still absolutely loved it . So I ' m going to sound dumb.
I mean , is there a scale to it , at the smallest scale , or ... ? 
And these patterns of points that I ' ve shown for you actually represent symmetries of this high-dimensional object that would be warping and moving and dancing over the space time that we experience.
GL : No , it would be one of the symmetries of this E8 shape.
GL : Well , as far as we know electrons are point particles , so this would be going down to the smallest possible scales.
And , as I said , the way the shape twists -- the directional along which way the shape is twisting as it moves over this curved surface -- is what the elementary particles are , themselves.
It ' s evoking a kind of sense of wonder , and I certainly want to understand more of this.

We can go , jambo , guten Abend , bonsoir , but we can also ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh.
He was talking about this amazing , three-year-old Australopithecine child , Selam.
It ' s kind of commonplace now , but his argument was -- because he ' d been searching for the fossilized remains of early humans in Africa.
He argued -- and it ' s now a fairly common theory -- that if we found behavior patterns similar or the same in our closest living relatives , the great apes , and humans today , then maybe those behaviors were present in the ape-like , human-like ancestor some seven million years ago.
So it remains for me to comment on the ways in which chimpanzees are so like us , in certain aspects of their behavior.
Thereafter , she has one baby only every five or six years , a long period of childhood dependency when the child is nursing , sleeping with the mother at night , and riding on her back.
We know now that they ' re capable of imitating behaviors that they see.
They also kiss , hold hands , pat one another on the back.
They ' re capable of extreme brutality , even a kind of primitive war.
It ' s a very blurry line , and it ' s getting more blurry all the time as we make even more observations.
This is just one photograph from the air , and it shows you the forested highlands of Gombe.
The numbers increased by refugees pouring in from Burundi and over the lake from Congo.
It started small with 12 villages . It ' s now in 24.
Working to help the villagers obtain fresh water from wells.
Empowering women , working with education , providing scholarships for girls so they can finish secondary school , in the clear understanding that , all around the world , as women ' s education improves , family size drops.
It was a Tanzanian team talking to the villagers , asking what they were interested in.
They began to understand that as the upper levels of the hills were denuded of trees , so you ' ve got this terrible soil erosion and mudslides.
So TACARE is a success.
And when you get large numbers of people living in land that is not that fertile , particularly when you cut down trees , and you leave the soil open to the wind for erosion , as desperate populations cut down more and more trees , so that they can try and grow food for themselves and their families , what ' s going to happen ?  Something ' s got to give.
And what ' s happened ?  I mean , the question here is , here we are , arguably the most intelligent being that ' s ever walked planet Earth , with this extraordinary brain , capable of the kind of technology that is so well illustrated by these TED Conferences , and yet we ' re destroying the only home we have.
As I began traveling around Africa talking about the problems faced by chimpanzees and their vanishing forests , I realized more and more how so many of Africa ' s problems could be laid at the door of previous colonial exploitation.
The air that we breathe that often poisons us.
We ' ve talked about the soil erosion.
And it ' s the poor people who are affected worse.
And the numbers of people living in an area that the land cannot support , who are too poor to buy food , who can ' t move away because the whole land is degraded.
We seem to have lost wisdom , the wisdom of the indigenous people.
We have compromised their future.
Shoots seem tiny ; to reach the sun they can break through a brick wall.
We have a choice . Every one of us in this room , we have a choice as to what kind of difference we want to make.
But basically , we have programs now from preschool right through university , with more and more adults starting their own Roots and Shoots groups.
One of their projects will be to help animals -- not just wildlife , domestic animals as well.
We not do have more than this one planet.
It ' s being used in Uganda to give some psychological help to ex-child soldiers.
So , there ' s no time for more Roots and Shoots now.
Hope . That ' s the question I get asked as I ' m going around the world :  " Jane , you ' ve seen so many terrible things , you ' ve seen your chimpanzees decrease in number from about one million , at the turn of the century , to no more than 150,000 now , and the same with so many other animals.
And of course , there ' s hope . One is this amazing human brain.
We just flush all this water down the lavatory , it ' s terrible.
Do we care about their future ? 
How will it affect the life of my child when he or she grows up ? 
All of these technologies we can use.
And the next reason for hope -- nature is amazingly resilient.
And animals , almost on the brink of extinction , can be given a second chance . That ' s my next book.
Ken Saro-Wiwa , in Nigeria , who took on the giant oil companies , and although people around the world tried their best , was executed.
So I ' m really grateful for this opportunity to share this message again , with everyone at TED.
She was in the leadership in Dar es Salaam.
Artist Dianna Cohen shares some tough truths about plastic pollution in the ocean and in our lives -- and some thoughts on how to free ourselves from the plastic gyre.
I ' m a visual artist , and I ' m also one of the co-founders of the Plastic Pollution Coalition.
And I thought ,  " Great.
And what we ' re finding is that a lot of it is in the marine environment.
So I actually developed a proposal to go out with a cargo ship and two decommissioned fishing trawlers , a crane , a chipping machine and a cold-molding machine.
We need to cut the spigot of single-use and disposable plastics , which are entering the marine environment every day on a global scale.
I ' d go to the supermarket and all of my food is packaged in plastic.
We have many initiatives that we ' re working on , but some of them are very basic.
You put something in a bin and you don ' t have to think about it again.
It is down-cycled and turned into lesser things , while a glass bottle can be a glass bottle again or can be used again -- a plastic bottle can never be a plastic bottle again.
Alternatives exist ; some of them are very old-school.
I guess what I want to say to everybody here -- and I know that you guys know a lot about this issue -- is that this is a huge problem in the oceans , but this is a problem that we ' ve created as consumers and we can solve.

Pattie Maes and Pranav Mistry demo SixthSense
When you meet someone here at TED -- and this is the top networking place , of course , of the year -- you don ' t shake somebody ' s hand and then say ,  " Can you hold on for a moment while I take out my phone and Google you ?  " 
And I ' m here to unveil our latest effort , and most successful effort so far , which is still very much a work in process.
And in the video here we see my student Pranav Mistry , who ' s really the genius who ' s been implementing and designing this whole system.
But if you want a more stylish version you could also paint your nails in different colors.
So , some of you most likely were here two years ago and saw the demo by Jeff Han or some of you may think ,  " Well , doesn ' t this look like the Microsoft Surface Table ?  " 
So one important difference is that it ' s totally mobile.
And , as he picks up a product the system can recognize the product that he ' s picking up , using either image recognition or marker technology , and give him the green light or an orange light.
If he picks up a book in the bookstore , he can get an Amazon rating -- it gets projected right on the cover of the book.
Reading the newspaper -- it never has to be outdated.
In this case , the student is interested in cameras , etc.
My student Pranav , who ' s really , like I said , the genius behind this.
And who knows , maybe in another 10 years we ' ll be here with the ultimate sixth sense brain implant.
9/11 healing : The mothers who found forgiveness , friendship
I first learned that my son had been in the World Trade Center on the morning of September 11th , 2001.
And when I saw it -- and yet , through the shock , the terrible shock , and the terrible explosion in our lives , literally , we were not vengeful.
Someday I want to meet that woman when I ' m stronger. " 
But when people learned what her son was accused of , she didn ' t get that sympathy.
I am the mother of Zacarias Moussaoui.
She was the only mother in the group.
I was married when I was 14.
I know she really cried for her son.
I don ' t know what happened to him.
We must be hand-in-hand and do something together.
So if I can save one of the young girls , and avoid that they get married and suffer as much as I did , well this is something good.
 " Why does she want to meet us ?  " 
Before we knew each others '  names , or anything , we had embraced and wept.
But she reached out to us in that way , and it was , I ' d like to say , it was an ice-breaker.
I never had met someone with such a hard life , from such a totally different culture and environment from my own.
So , Aicha , do you have a couple of words for conclusion ? 
You must be tolerant.
http://www.ted.com/talks/michael_pritchard_invents_a_water_filter.html
Michael Pritchard ' s water filter turns filthy water drinkable
Now I see you ' ve all been enjoying the water that ' s been provided for you here at the conference , over the past couple of days.
Then statistics would actually say that half of you would now be suffering with diarrhea.
It ' s because , using current thinking , the scale of the problem just seems too huge to contemplate solving.
And four children have just died.
That really stuck with me.
Day two : nothing.
Now I spent a lot of time in my garage , over the next weeks and months , and also in my kitchen -- much to the dismay of my wife.
The smallest bacteria is about 200 nanometers.
Lifesaver pores are 15 nanometers.
I spent all the time setting this up , so I guess I should.
But I got to thinking , you know , if we were in the middle of a flood zone in Bangladesh , the water wouldn ' t look like this.
Okay . Right.
So I ' m just going to put that in there.
So we ' re just going to put that in there as well.
Today I ' m going to use a jug just to show you all . Let ' s get a bit of that poo in there.
Replace the top.
I ' ve got to be quick . Okay , ready ? 
There you go Chris.
Let ' s see Chris ' s program throughout the rest of the show . Okay ? 
Pop the cartridge out . Pop a new one in.
We ship water.
Diseases spread . More resources are required.
Now , it doesn ' t require a natural disaster for this to work.
Instead of shipping water , and using man-made processes to do it , let ' s use Mother Nature . She ' s got a fantastic system.
Well , we could use the Lifesaver bottle.
And how much does it cost ? 
So with just eight billion dollars , we can hit the millennium goal ' s target of halving the number of people without access to safe drinking water.
So the three-and-a-half billion people that suffer every year as a result , and the two million kids that die every year , will live.

And the poem goes :  " On the idle hill of summer , lazy with the flow of streams , hark I hear a distant drummer , drumming like a sound in dreams , far and near and low and louder on the roads of earth go by , dear to friend and food to powder , soldiers marching , soon to die. " 
And my message for you is that I believe we are condemned , if you like , to live at just one of those moments in history when the gimbals upon which the established order of power is beginning to change and the new look of the world , the new powers that exist in the world , are beginning to take form.
And of course , into the vacuum where the too-old European powers used to be were played the two bloody catastrophes of the last century -- the one in the first part and the one in the second part : the two great World Wars.
And the first of these , the first two of these , is about a shift in power.
We have seen lateral shifts of power -- the power of Greece passed to Rome and the power shifts that occurred during the European civilizations -- but we are seeing something slightly different.
The globalization of power -- we talk about the globalization of markets , but actually it ' s the globalization of real power.
Now that suits the powerful up to a moment.
You see , our enemies also use this space -- the space of mass travel , the Internet , satellite broadcasters -- to be able to get around their poison , which is about destroying our systems and our ways.
Now notice , I ' m not talking about government.
The world needs an international forum.
And if you look , you can see them happening , already beginning to emerge.
And that ' s what the G20 is , a treaty-based institution.
And watch that beginning to happen.
Now that begins with economic power , but that ' s the way it always begins.
We are coming out of 50 years , most unusual years , of history in which we have had a totally mono-polar world , in which every compass needle for or against has to be referenced by its position to Washington -- a world bestrode by a single colossus.
Up until now , the United States has been the dominant feature of our world.
But that ' s a subject of a different discussion.
There was a balance , a five-sided balance.
A fixed polarity of power means fixed alliances.
And we will see increasingly that even we in the West will reach out , have to reach out , beyond the cozy circle of the Atlantic powers to make alliances with others if we want to get things done in the world.
My guess is that we ' re reaching the beginning of the end of 400 years -- I say 400 years because it ' s the end of the Ottoman Empire -- of the hegemony of Western power , Western institutions and Western values.
The West got together -- the Bretton Woods Institution , World Bank , International Monetary Fund -- the problem solved.
Let me make a prediction for you , which is probably even more startling.
How many Chinese troops are serving under the blue beret , serving under the blue flag , serving under the U.N . command in the world today ? 
The Chinese naval contingent.
It ' s a whole new different way of looking at the world that is now emerging.
We are now interlocked , as nations , as individuals , in a way which has never been the case before , never been the case before.
You get swine flu in Mexico , it ' s a problem for Charles de Gaulle Airport 24 hours later.
And what that means is the idea of a nation state acting alone , not connected with others , not working with others , is no longer a viable proposition.
That was when the enemy was outside the walls.
It ' s its capacity to lock together its institutions.
It ' s your capacity to network that matters , both within your governments and externally.
The most important bit about your structure -- whether you ' re a government , whether you ' re an army regiment , whether you ' re a business -- is your docking points , your interconnectors , your capacity to network with others.
Suddenly and for the very first time , collective defense , the thing that has dominated us as the concept of securing our nations , is no longer enough.
When I was a diplomat negotiating the disarmament treaties with the Soviet Union in Geneva in the 1970s , we succeeded because we understood we shared a destiny with them.
One of the great barriers to peace in the Middle East is that both sides , both Israel and , I think , the Palestinians , do not understand that they share a collective destiny.
 " Send not for whom the bell tolls. " 
For us , I think , part of the equation for our survival.

So the premise of Blue Zones : if we can find the optimal lifestyle of longevity we can come up with a de facto formula for longevity.
There is what Oprah tells us.
Should you eat organic meats or should you be eating tofu ? 
Spirituality ?  And how about how we socialize ? 
But first I ' d like to debunk some common myths when it comes to longevity.
Your chances are very low.
I love that word.
If you ' re a mammal , if you ' re a rat or an elephant , or a human , in between , it ' s the same story.
When you think of it , there is 99 things that can age us.
There is just too many things to go wrong.
And it builds up exponentially.
So , if there is nothing you can do to slow your aging or stop your aging , what am I doing here ? 
These are years that we could get.
And not the entire island , the island is about 1.4 million people , but only up in the highlands , an area called the Nuoro province.
Their history actually goes back to about the time of Christ.
They came up with an unleavened whole wheat bread called carta musica made out of durum wheat , a type of cheese made from grass-fed animals so the cheese is high in Omega-3 fatty acids instead of Omega-6 fatty acids from corn-fed animals , and a type of wine that has three times the level of polyphenols than any known wine in the world.
You ever notice here in America , social equity seems to peak at about age 24 ? 
This , as it turns out , is not only good for your aging parents to keep them close to the family -- it imparts about four to six years of extra life expectancy -- research shows it ' s also good for the children of those families , who have lower rates of mortality and lower rates of disease.
And in the northern part of the main island , this is ground zero for world longevity.
They live a long time , and tend to die in their sleep , very quickly , and often , I can tell you , after sex.
And one sixth the rate of cardiovascular disease.
And they eat about eight times as much tofu as Americans do.
Instead of serving family style , where you can sort of mindlessly eat as you ' re talking , they serve at the counter , put the food away , and then bring it to the table.
It ' s simply a little saying these people say before their meal to remind them to stop eating when their stomach is [80] percent full.
We know that isolation kills.
They call it a Moai . And if you ' re in a Moai you ' re expected to share the bounty if you encounter luck , and if things go bad , child gets sick , parent dies , you always have somebody who has your back.
There is our work life , where we ' re productive.
Instead there is one word that imbues your entire life , and that word is  " ikigai. " 
And this is a question . The National Institute on Aging actually gave us a questionnaire to give these centenarians.
For this 102 year old woman , her ikigai was simply her great-great-great-granddaughter.
I thought that was a wonderful thought.
So , we turned to the data again.
A  " 24-hour sanctuary in time, "  they call it.
And the difference is even more pronounced among men , who are expected to live about 11 years longer than their American counterparts.
It ' s white , black , Hispanic , Asian.
They take this sanctuary in time very serious.
Adventists also tend to hang out with other Adventists.
This is a culture that has yielded Ellsworth Whareham.
And predictably , perhaps , on the fourth day he ended up in the operating room.
And on weekends he likes to put on the boards , throw up rooster tails.
She starts her day with lifting weights.
I ' m probably the only person you ' ll ever meet who rode his bicycle across the Sahara desert without sunscreen.
What are the things that they all do ? 
Instead , they set up their lives so that they are constantly nudged into physical activity.
They don ' t have any conveniences.
That burns calories just as much as going on the treadmill does.
The Sardinians pray . The Seventh-Day Adventists pray.
They have vocabulary for sense of purpose , ikigai , like the Okinawans.
Instead , these people drink a little bit every day , not a hard sell to the American population.
And then the foundation of all this is how they connect.
They were either born into or they proactively surrounded themselves with the right people.
Diets don ' t work . No diet in the history of the world has ever worked for more than two percent of the population.
http://www.ted.com/talks/catarina_mota_play_with_smart_materials.html
Catarina Mota : Play with smart materials
Many of these do-it-yourself practices were lost in the second half of the 20th century.
Let me show you some examples.
And this is a sheet of acrylic infused with colorless light-diffusing particles.
So I ' m going to place this on a hot plate that is set to a temperature only slightly higher than ambient and you can see what happens.
We may not yet have the flying cars science fiction promised us , but we can have walls that change color depending on temperature , keyboards that roll up , and windows that become opaque at the flick of a switch.
Smart materials are hard to obtain in small quantities.
It ' s a website where we , and anyone else who wants to join us , share experiments , publish information , encourage others to contribute whenever they can , and aggregate resources such as research papers and tutorials by other makers like ourselves.
The objects we use , the clothes we wear , the houses we live in , all have a profound impact on our behavior , health and quality of life.
The biggest challenge is that material science is complex and requires expensive equipment.
He used a toaster oven , and he even made his own vortex mixer , based on a tutorial by another scientist/maker.
Another example I ' d like to mention Her project ' s goal is to highlight the expressive qualities of materials while focusing on the creativity and skills of the builder.
[ " Paper speakers " ] What we ' re seeing here is just a piece of paper with some copper tape on it connected to an mp3 player and a magnet.
So Hannah ' s artisanal work , and the fact that she shared her findings , opens the doors to a series of new possibilities that are both aesthetically appealing and innovative.
So I feel a bit as Ted Nelson must have when , in the early 1970s , he wrote ,  " You must understand computers now. " 
http://www.ted.com/talks/jennifer_healey_if_cars_could_talk_accidents_might_be_avoidable.html
Jennifer Healey : If cars could talk , accidents might be avoidable
So what happens ? 
I step on the brake.
I slammed on the brakes.
I just want you to think a little bit about what the experience of driving is like now.
You ' re tasked with navigating it down partially-seen roadways , in and amongst other metal giants , at super-human speeds.
Stop looking where you ' re going , turn , check your blind spot , and drive down the road without looking where you ' re going.
And usually we do a fantastic job picking and choosing what we attend to on the road.
And I believe that . I believe that.
We will be able to see the velocity of the car in front of us , to see how fast that guy ' s going or stopping.
How can you predict the future ?  That ' s really hard.
Often they travel on pre-published routes.
Right ?  I mean , somebody ' s seen him.
I mean , they ' re Newtonian objects.
If I have a GPS and a camera in my car , I have a pretty precise idea of where I am and how fast I ' m going.
What happens if two cars share that data , if they talk to each other ? 
Professor Bob Wang and his team have done computer simulations of what happens when fuzzy estimates combine , even in light traffic , when cars just share GPS data , and we ' ve moved this research out of the computer simulation and into robot test beds that have the actual sensors that are in cars now on these robots : stereo cameras , GPS , and the two-dimensional laser range finders that are common in backup systems.
One of the problems , when you get too much chatter , it ' s hard to process all the packets , so you have to prioritize , and that ' s where the predictive model helps you.
And you can predict the new trajectory.
How can these cars whisper ,  " You need to get out of the way ?  " 
And now , using a series of three cameras , we can detect if a driver is looking forward , looking away , looking down , on the phone , or having a cup of coffee.
I think it ' s a very disconcerting notion , this idea that our cars will be watching us , talking about us to other cars , that we ' ll be going down the road in a sea of gossip.
And I think it ' s going to be a great thing.
It ' s going to make the roads a lot safer.

And I want to tell you that story.
Craig Venter chairs that event.
Well , the only way to experience zero-g on Earth is actually with parabolic flight , weightless flight.
You can get eight , 10 minutes of weightlessness -- how NASA ' s trained their astronauts for so long.
We had one government agency and one company aircraft operator say , you ' re crazy , don ' t do that , you ' re going kill the guy.
We had a press conference , we announced our intent to do one zero-g parabola , give him 25 seconds of zero-g.
He said ,  " Life on Earth is at an ever-increasing risk of being wiped out by disaster ...
We had about 20 people who made donations -- we raised $150,000 in donations for children ' s charities -- who flew with us.
We were monitoring his PO2 of his blood , his heart rate , his blood pressure.
Once he was there , [we] let him go to experience what weightlessness was truly like.
We actually floated an apple in homage to Sir Isaac Newton because Professor Hawking holds the same chair at Cambridge that Isaac Newton did.
He was so happy.

These are expressions of truth as awe-full things , by meaning they are things you can worship.
Truth and beauty are things that are often opaque to people who are not in the sciences.
Students today are often immersed in an environment where what they learn is subjects that have truth and beauty embedded in them , but the way they ' re taught is compartmentalized and it ' s drawn down to the point where the truth and beauty are not always evident.
And I had a telephone call from Robert Lue at Harvard , in the Molecular and Cellular Biology Department , a couple of years ago . He asked me if my team and I would be interested and willing to really change how medical and scientific education is done at Harvard.
These micro-machines , which are the envy of nanotechnologists the world over , are self-directed , powerful , precise , accurate devices that are made out of strings of amino acids.
And so what we wanted to do was to figure out how we could make this story into an animation that would be the centerpiece of BioVisions at Harvard , which is a website that Harvard has for its molecular and cellular biology students that will -- in addition to all the textual information , in addition to all the didactic stuff -- put everything together visually , so that these students would have an internalized view of what a cell really is in all of its truth and beauty , and be able to study with this view in mind , so that their imaginations would be sparked , so that their passions would be sparked and so that they would be able to go on and use these visions in their head to make new discoveries and to be able to find out , really , how life works.
So these molecular motors -- we had to work with the Harvard scientists and databank models of the atomically accurate molecules and figure out how they moved , and figure out what they did.
Run the movie , please.
And the cell will actually manufacture the parts that it needs on the fly , from information that ' s brought from the nucleus by molecules that read the genes.
This little guy is called the kinesin , and he pulls a sack that ' s full of brand new manufactured proteins to wherever it ' s needed in the cell -- whether it ' s to a membrane , whether it ' s to an organelle , whether it ' s to build something or repair something.
And think about some of the things that we ' re learning about cellular mechanics.
They work together . They make the cell do what it needs to do.
Becky Blanton planned to live in her van for a year and see the country , but when depression set in and her freelance job ended , her camping trip turned into homelessness . In this intimate talk , she describes her experience of becoming one of America ' s working homeless.
I ' m a writer and a journalist , and I ' m also an insanely curious person , so in 22 years as a journalist , I ' ve learned how to do a lot of new things.
His death hit me pretty hard.
One : that society equates living in a permanent structure , even a shack , with having value as a person.
I showered in campgrounds . I ate out regularly.
What had been a really mild spring turned into a miserably hot summer.
And I sweated.
Food rotted in the heat.
And when the heat made me too sick to walk the 50 feet to the public restroom outside my van at night , I used a bucket and a trash bag as a toilet.
I didn ' t always succeed.
My talent , my integrity , my values , everything about me remained the same.
And I went . I hadn ' t bathed in three days.
Other homeless people didn ' t see me as homeless , but I did.
A friend told me , shortly after that , that she had heard that Tim Russert , a nationally renowned journalist , had been talking about me on national T.V.
You should too.
And I cried.
I alternated between living in a van and couch surfing with friends.
I was no longer homeless.
So the homeless , the working homeless , primarily remain invisible.
I ' m not here to encourage you to give money to the next panhandler you meet.

Mechai Viravaidya : How Mr . Condom made Thailand a better place
But we began with a family-planning program , following a very successful maternal child health activity , sets of activities.
Now let me take you back as to why we needed to do it.
We needed to reduce the population growth rate.
We went to the nurses and the midwives , who were also women , and did a fantastic job at explaining how to use the pill.
So we went to the ordinary people that you saw.
They were well-known in the community , they knew that customers were always right , and they were terrific , and they practiced their family planning themselves.
And then we decided , why not get to religion because in the Philippines , the Catholic Church was pretty strong , and Thai people were Buddhist.
So some of the monks in the villages were doing the same thing themselves.
And then we went to teachers.
And then we had a snakes and ladders game , where you throw dice.
Uncle buys a condom . Very good , uncle . Move ahead.
We had relay races with condoms , we had children ' s condom-blowing championship.
If you ' re pregnant , take care of your pregnancy.
It ' s a part of the Village Development Bank ; it ' s not a real bank , but it ' s a fund -- microcredit.
And this is on the Fourth of July.
Of course , it must be American cola.
And here is this , then , young man called Willy Bohm who worked for the USAID.
And what happened ? 
And so that ' s the case of everyone joining in.
But unfortunately , the government was in denial , denial , denial.
They have more than the government , and they ' ve got more guns than the government.
And then we got a new prime minister soon after that.
He became the chairman of the National AIDS Committee and increased the budget fifty-fold.
So they were happy with that.
And these girls who go around teaching about safe sex and HIV were known as Mother Theresa.
And we said ,  " Everyone needs to be involved. " 
And they loved him . You need a symbol of something.
And also , in traffic , the policemen give you condoms -- our  " cops and rubbers "  programs.
And then , new change , we had hair bands , clothing and the condom for your mobile phone during the rainy season.
And then it says here , with the American flag ,  " Don ' t leave home without it. " 
Look at this -- I gave this to Al Gore and to Bill Senior also.
Why just run around ? 
And then what happened ? 
So it just showed you , you could do something about it.
We all need to help.
We ' re trying to turn them into barefoot entrepreneurs , little business people.
It ' s not a free gift.
And we believe if you want to help the poor , those who are living in poverty , access to credit must be a human right.
Here ' s what we call a  " barefoot MBA, "  teaching people how to do business so that , when they borrow money , they ' ll succeed with the business.
And then we have silk , Thai silk.
See , Starbucks you awake , we keep you awake and alive.
And then now , finally in education , we want to change the school as being underutilized into a place where it ' s a lifelong learning center for everyone.
And here is a bamboo building -- all of them are bamboo.
And then , finally , I firmly believe , if we want the MDGs to work -- the Millennium Development Goals -- we need to add family planning to it.
And then , finally , that is our network.
Your smartphone may feel like a friend -- but a true friend would give you a smile once in a while . At TED2013 , Keller Rinaudo demos Romo , the smartphone-powered mini robot who can motor along with you on a walk , slide you a cup of coffee across the table , and react to you with programmable expressions.
So just by a show of hands , how many of you all have a robot at home ? 
That ' s okay.
This robot can ' t be creepy or uncanny.
And by leveraging the power of the iPhone ' s processor , we can create a robot that is wi-fi enabled and computer vision-capable for 150 bucks , which is about one percent of what these kinds of robots have cost in the past.
He ' s wary , so he ' ll keep his eyes on me.
So in a lot of ways , Romo is like a pet that has a mind of his own.
So here ' s the iPad.
So I ' ll show you really quickly , Romo actually -- he ' s streaming video , so you can see me and the entire TED audience.
I ' ve always wanted a picture of a 1,500-person TED audience.
And finally , because Romo is an extension of me , I can express myself through his emotions.
In fact , who would like to drive a robot ? 
And even cooler , you actually don ' t have to be in the same geographic location as the robot to control him.
You can imagine an eight-year-old girl , for example , who has an iPhone , and her mom buys her a robot.
So those are a couple of the really cool things that Romo can do today.
This allows you to drag and drop these blocks of semantic code and create any behavior for this robot you want.
And then if you have something you ' re proud of , you can share it with every other person who owns a robot in the world.
So we think that if you ' re going to have a robot in your home , that robot ought to be a manifestation of your own imagination.
The future of personal robotics is happening today , and it ' s going to depend on small , agile robots like Romo and the creativity of people like yourselves.
entertainment,global issues,love,parenting,storytelling,women,world cultures
I ' m here to tell you a few tales of passion.
All stories interest me , and some haunt me until I end up writing them.
That made me a celebrity . Now people recognize me in Macy ' s , and my grandchildren think that I ' m cool.
Actually , I wasn ' t even sure that I could go around the stadium without a walker.
My first question was , naturally , what was I going to wear ? 
By the middle of February , I found myself in Turin , where enthusiastic crowds cheered when any of the 80 Olympic teams was in the street.
However , what matters most -- more than training or luck -- is the heart.
Passion lives here . Isn ' t it always true ? 
People like all of you in this room.
Also , two women with passionate hearts : Wangari Maathai , the Nobel prizewinner from Kenya who has planted 30 million trees . And by doing so , she has changed the soil , the weather , in some places in Africa , and of course the economic conditions in many villages.
And of brothels where children are forced to receive five , 15 clients per day , and if they rebel , they are tortured with electricity.
But so did most of the flag-bearers , except Sophia Loren , the universal symbol of beauty and passion.
I don ' t know.
No grunting , no coughing , no wheezing , no talking to yourselves , no farting.
She walked elegantly , like a giraffe on the African savannah , holding the flag on her shoulder . I jogged behind -- on my tiptoes -- holding the flag on my extended arm , so that my head was actually under the damn flag.
The best four minutes of my entire life were those in the Olympic stadium.
So here ' s a tale of passion.
The protagonists of this story are a young woman , Rose Mapendo , and her children.
Two tiny little boys.
Somehow , the family survives for 16 months , and then , by extraordinary luck , and the passionate heart of a young American man , Sasha Chanoff , who manages to put her in a U.S . rescue plane , Rose Mapendo and her nine children end up in Phoenix , Arizona , where they ' re now living and thriving.
I look around and I see them everywhere.
No wonder that by age five I was a raging feminist -- although the term had not reached Chile yet , so nobody knew what the heck was wrong with me.
We had a memorable fight . Feminism is dated ? 
They are raped , beaten up and sometimes killed with impunity.
It has evolved . If you don ' t like the term , change it , for Goddess '  sake.
The year is 2005.
The first patient is in excruciating pain because she has several rotten molars.
She doesn ' t even have the proper instruments , but fortunately she has brought some Novocaine.
That day the hygienist pulls out many more teeth.
The husband , furious , threatens to kill the American.
They are the poorest of the poor.
If a woman is empowered , her children and her family will be better off.
She gets the women to plant new trees and water them , drop by drop.
For every dollar given to a women ' s program , 20 dollars are given to men ' s programs.
In any war today , most of the casualties are civilians , mainly women and children . They are collateral damage.
Does it make sense to participate in the existing world order ? 
They are huge paintings of torture and abuse of power , in the voluminous Botero style.
In our species , the alpha males define reality , and force the rest of the pack to accept that reality and follow the rules.
Even the most destitute of men have someone they can abuse -- a woman or a child.
We need a critical number of women in positions of power , and we need to nurture the feminine energy in men.
But given a choice , I would rather have the warrior hearts of Wangari Maathai , Somaly Mam , Jenny and Rose Mapendo.
Let ' s get off our fannies , roll up our sleeves and get to work , passionately , in creating an almost perfect world.
cities,culture,food,global issues
It ' s one of the great questions of our time.
We live in places like this as if they ' re the most natural things in the world , forgetting that because we ' re animals and that we need to eat , we ' re actually as dependent on the natural world as our ancient ancestors were.
As more of us move into cities , more of us are eating meat , so that a third of the annual grain crop globally now gets fed to animals rather than to us human animals.
And it ' s also estimated that there is going to be twice as much meat and dairy consumed.
That ' s a big problem . And actually if we carry on as we are , it ' s a problem we ' re very unlikely to be able to solve.
It takes about 10 calories to produce every calorie of food that we consume in the West.
A billion of us are obese , while a further billion starve.
And if we look to the future , it ' s an unsustainable diet.
Because , as you can see , it was crescent shaped.
Because it was discovery of grain by our ancient ancestors for the first time that produced a food source that was large enough and stable enough to support permanent settlements.
So , if you like , the whole spiritual and physical life of these cities was dominated by the grain and the harvest that sustained them.
So how did a city like this feed itself ? 
And the food obviously went off very quickly.
So Rome shaped its hinterland through its appetite.
And the roads leading up from them to Cheapside , which was the main market , were also grain markets.
And of course Billingsgate , famously , was London ' s fish market , operating on-site here until the mid-1980s.
Meat is a very different story because , of course , animals could walk into the city.
I feel a bit like a weather woman doing this . Anyway , and so the birds were coming in with their feet protected with little canvas shoes.
Friday Street , in a previous life , is where you went to buy your fish on a Friday.
In fact , if you were having Sunday lunch , the chances were it was mooing or bleating outside your window about three days earlier.
And as you can see , some of the earliest train passengers were pigs and sheep.
And this changes everything.
And as you can see from these maps of London , in the 90 years after the trains came , it goes from being a little blob that was quite easy to feed by animals coming in on foot , and so on , to a large splurge , that would be very , very difficult to feed with anybody on foot , either animals or people.
In fact , what they did to get food was they got in their cars , drove to a box somewhere on the outskirts , came back with a week ' s worth of shopping , and wondered what on earth to do with it.
Now it ' s anonymous.
And we don ' t value food . We don ' t trust it.
By making it possible to build cities anywhere and any place , they ' ve actually distanced us from our most important relationship , which is that of us and nature.
500 years ago it ' s what Thomas More was asking himself.
And here is another very famous  " Utopian "  vision , that of Ebenezer Howard ,  " The Garden City. " 
And that is the problem with these Utopian ideas , that they are Utopian.
Because it ' s an ideal . It ' s an imaginary thing . We can ' t have it.
We live in a world shaped by food , and if we realize that , we can use food as a really powerful tool -- a conceptual tool , design tool , to shape the world differently.
But anyway , this is -- it ' s food at the center of life , at the center of family life , being celebrated , being enjoyed , people taking time for it.
It ' s people who think about food , who think ahead , who plan , who can stare at a pile of raw vegetables and actually recognize them.
But networks , markets where food is being grown locally.
Cows with a view.
It ' s a greenhouse , where kids get told all about food and growing their own food.
It ' s basically recognizing that Sitopia already exists in little pockets everywhere.
But of course , that ' s not a great image either , because we need not to be producing food like this anymore.
It ' s Ambrogio Lorenzetti ' s  " Allegory of Good Government. " 
And I want us to ask now , what would Ambrogio Lorenzetti paint if he painted this image today ? 
We know we are what we eat.
Weeks from the Charter for Compassion launch , Karen Armstrong looks at religion ' s role in the 21st century : Will its dogmas divide us ?  Or will it unite us for common good ?  She reviews the catalysts that can drive the world ' s faiths to rediscover the Golden Rule.
For years I ' ve been feeling frustrated , because as a religious historian , I ' ve become acutely aware of the centrality of compassion in all the major world faiths.
Look into your own heart , discover what it is that gives you pain and then refuse , under any circumstance whatsoever , to inflict that pain on anybody else.
Something that goes beyond what we know in our ego-bound existence.
I sometimes see when I ' m speaking to a congregation of religious people a sort of mutinous expression crossing their faces because people often want to be right instead.
Because I feel an urgency about this.
And of course it ' s not just religious people who believe in the Golden Rule.
That is the Torah and everything else is only commentary. " 
We have to make this happen , and we can do it with the modern communications that TED has introduced.
Throughout Europe , the Muslim communities are holding events and discussions , are discussing the centrality of compassion in Islam and in all faiths.
And I intend to work on this till my dying day.
But of course you don ' t understand compassion if you ' re just going to think about it.
I ' d like youth to get a sense of the dynamism , the dynamic and challenge of a compassionate lifestyle.
Because we can change the world , we have the ability.
Because that is what is so wonderful about TED.
But he wrote one thing that stuck in my mind ever since I read it when I was a schoolgirl.
We don ' t have to fall in love with each other , but we can become friends.
And we learn to live together and to get to know one another.

Sometimes I make a lot of drawings and I still don ' t understand what it is I ' m drawing.
Now , I could talk about something that I ' m known for , something that would be particularly appropriate for many of the more technically minded people here , or I could talk about something I really care about.
Well , I went to Rhode Island School of Design in the second half of the  ' 60s to study architecture.
So , whenever given an opportunity , I try to do something in it or with it or for it.
So , I ' m going to show you some pictures of Rome.
Part of the reason I ' m showing you these is that it sort of helps illustrate this process I go through of trying to figure out what it is I feel about Rome and why I feel it.
Part of the reason for that is the fact that they grew up organically.
And I ' m going to show you a bunch of dead ends , basically.
Here that same line of text wraps around a fountain in an illustration that can be turned upside down and read both ways.
But even though I just started this presentation , this is not the first thing that I tried to do and I was getting sort of desperate.
But one of the ideas that emerged from some of those sketches was the notion of traveling through Rome in different vehicles at different speeds in order to show the different aspects of Rome.
Went to Alberto Santos-Dumont.
This is Beatrix . She has a dog named Ajax , she has purchased a dirigible -- a small dirigible -- she ' s assembling the structure , Ajax is sniffing for holes in the balloon before they set off.
Unfortunately , just across the road from it or quite close by is the Column of Marcus Aurelius , and the diameter of the dirigible makes an impression , as you can see , as she starts trying to read the story that spirals around the Column of Marcus Aurelius -- gets a little too close , nudges it.
She parks her dirigible , lowers the anchor rope and climbs down for a closer look inside.
She continues on her way over Piazza Navona.
Unfortunately , when she goes to unwrap the prosciutto , Ajax makes a lunge for it.
Turns out to be the exterior wall -- that part of it that remains -- of the Coliseum , so they park themselves there and have a terrific lunch and have a spectacular view.
Marcello , on the other hand , is sort of a lazy guy , but he ' s not due at work until about noon.
So , he keeps on moving , approaching an unsuspecting waiter who is trying to deliver two plates of linguine in a delicate white wine clam sauce to diners who are sitting at a table just outside of a restaurant in the street.
Removes some scaffolding . One of the reasons Rome remains the extraordinary place it is that because of scaffolding and the determination to maintain the fabric , it is a city that continues to grow and adapt to the needs of the particular time in which it finds itself , or we find it.
He ' s looking at his table ; he ' s planning to propose this evening to his girlfriend of 40 years , and he wants it to be perfect.
He saunters -- he saunters at a good clip , but as compared to all the traveling we ' ve just seen , he ' s sauntering.
He arrives at the palazzo , arrives at the big front door.
He opens the window of the attic , of course , and there ' s a tablecloth wrapped around the building ' s television antenna.
That was the first attempt , but it didn ' t seem substantial enough to convey whatever it was I wanted to convey about Rome.
You see that I ' m beginning to really lose control here and also hope.
I mean , you always peel one layer off another ; we think of them as pages , doing it a certain way.
You can see that in 1635 , it became essential to make smaller windows because the bad guys were coming or whatever.
So it becomes slightly three-dimensional.
But then I thought , maybe I could be simpler here.
And if I turn the book the other way , we ' re looking across the square at the front of the Pantheon.
And I thought , maybe I ' m on the right track , but it sort of lost its human quality.
But it was the journey of the ...
So it ' s a homeless pigeon now and it ' s going to have to find another place to live , and that allows me to go through my catalog of favorite things , and we start with the tall ones and so on.
He ' ll go anywhere to get them -- dangerous places and whatnot -- and they become really friends with this guy , and learn to do tricks for him and entertain him at lunchtime and stuff like that.
They show up one day after three or four days of not seeing him -- he lives in this little garret -- and they spell his name and fly around.
And I thought that ' s a really cheery story.
So , these are all title pages that eventually led me to the solution I settled on , which is the story of a young woman who sends a message on a homing pigeon -- she lives outside the walls of the city of Rome -- to someone in the city.
And it becomes necessary and possible , at this point , to try to convey what that sense would be like of flying over the city without actually moving.
So , we circle around the Coliseum , past the Church of Santa Maria in Cosmedin and the Temple of Hercules towards the river.
The only rule of perspective that I think matters is if it looks believable , you ' ve succeeded.
I have all the pieces : there ' s Santa Maria della Pace , there ' s a soccer ball , there ' s a little bit of a bird ' s wing -- nothing ' s happening , so I had to rethink it.
And then we can swoop inside and around ; and because we ' re flying , we don ' t really have to worry about gravity at this particular moment in time , so this drawing can be oriented in any way on the page.
Straight up through the courtyard into a little window into the attic , where somebody is working at the drawing board.
http://www.ted.com/talks/skylar_tibbits_can_we_make_things_that_make_themselves.html
Skylar Tibbits : Can we make things that make themselves ? 
So in the current state of manufacturing , we have skyscrapers -- two and a half years [of assembly time] , 500,000 to a million parts , fairly complex , new , exciting technologies in steel , concrete , glass.
They ' re far more efficient in terms of energy.
And if we can translate that into our built environment , then there ' s some exciting potential for the way that we build things.
And we need to decode that into simple sequences -- basically the DNA of how our buildings work.
So I ' m going to show you a number of projects that my colleagues and I at MIT are working on to achieve this self-assembling future.
You decode what you want to fold up into , into a sequence of angles -- so negative 120 , negative 120 , 0 , 0 , 120 , negative 120 -- something like that ; so a sequence of angles , or turns , and you send that sequence through the string.
I mean , thousands of dollars , lots of man hours made to make this eight-foot robot.
It basically embeds the most fundamental building block of computing , the digital logic gate , directly into your parts.
The other one is from the previous brick that was placed.
And now it starts moving in three-dimensional space -- so up or down.
So they have all of the information embedded in them of what was constructed.
All the local information is embedded to tell you how to fix it.
So it takes the reconfigurability and programmability and makes it a completely passive system.
So as you assemble the chain , you ' re basically programming it.
So what does this tell us about the future ? 
We ' ll have spatial computing.
So I think these projects I ' ve showed here are just a tiny step towards this future , if we implement these new technologies for a new self-assembling world.

During his time at the American Museum of Natural History , Andrews led a range of expeditions to uncharted regions , like here in the Gobi Desert.
And I ' m here to tell you , if there ' s anything more intimidating than talking here at TED , it ' ll be trying to hold the attention of a group of a thousand 12-year-olds for a 45-minute lecture.
I think there ' s a sense that many of us have that the great age of exploration on Earth is over , that for the next generation they ' re going to have to go to outer space or the deepest oceans in order to find something significant to explore.
This is an explorer of the unseen world , Martinus Beijerinck.
He came up with a name for his mystery agent.
And obviously there ' s been tremendous practical applications associated with this world -- things like the eradication of smallpox , the advent of a vaccine against cervical cancer , which we now know is mostly caused by human papillomavirus.
We now have these amazing tools to allow us to explore the unseen world -- things like deep sequencing , which allow us to do much more than just skim the surface and look at individual genomes from a particular species , but to look at entire metagenomes , the communities of teeming microorganisms in , on and around us and to document all of the genetic information in these species.
And this is something we commonly do to look for respiratory viruses like influenza.
As we started to look at this information , we would see that about 20 percent of the genetic information in your nose doesn ' t match anything that we ' ve ever seen before -- no plant , animal , fungus , virus or bacteria.
And there ' s a lot of it.
These deep sequencing tools are relatively new.
That perhaps will allow us to identify the cause of a cancer that afflicts us or identify the source of an outbreak that we aren ' t familiar with or perhaps create a new tool in molecular biology.
It ' s true , we may have charted all the continents on the planet and we may have discovered all the mammals that are out there , but that doesn ' t mean that there ' s nothing left to explore on Earth.
There are unknowns all around us and they ' re just waiting to be discovered.
47
And the first one , in fact , is something that has been known for most of recorded history.
And we only get the one chance : if we mess up our spaceship , we ' ve got nowhere else to go.
And especially if you regard these two as deep truths to live by and to inform your life decisions , then they seem a little bit to conflict with each other.
But that ' s still not typical of the universe , because stars come in galaxies.
But we ' re still nowhere near a typical place in the universe.
Well , at enormous expense , TED has arranged a high-resolution immersion virtual reality rendering of intergalactic space -- the view from intergalactic space.
That ' s how big and how dark the universe is.
And it ' s very empty . The vacuum there is one million times less dense than the highest vacuum that our best technology on Earth can currently create . So that ' s how different a typical place is from this place.
Well , the Earth -- our environment , in the form of us -- is creating knowledge.
And we know what they are . Billions of years ago , and billions of light years away , the material at the center of a galaxy collapsed towards a super-massive black hole.
It would be a bit like experiencing a supernova explosion , but at point-blank range and for millions of years at a time.
Now that is knowledge . And if that weren ' t amazing enough , the faithfulness with which the one structure resembles the other is increasing with time . That is the growth of knowledge.
Its structure contains , with ever-increasing precision , the structure of everything . This place , and not other places in the universe , is a hub which contains within itself the structural and causal essence of the whole of the rest of physical reality . And so , far from being insignificant , the fact that the laws of physics allow this , or even mandate that this can happen , is one of the most important things about the physical world.
We also need energy to make the computer , and most important , to make the media in effect onto which we record the knowledge that we discover.
But the evidence that we used to do that was falling down on every square meter of the Earth for billions of years before that , and will continue to fall on for billions of years afterwards . And the same is true for all the other sciences.
As I said , it ' s empty ; it ' s cold ; and it ' s dark out there . Or is it ? 
Now , it ' s way beyond present technology to even gather the hydrogen from intergalactic space and form it into other elements and so on.
Well , again , it ' s dark out there to human senses . But all you ' ve got to do is take a telescope , even one of present-day design , look out and you ' ll see the same galaxies as we do from here.
Probably the hardest science to do would be biology field trips -- -- because it would take several hundred million years to get to the nearest life-bearing planet and back.
If intergalactic space is capable of creating an open-ended stream of explanations , then so is almost every other environment . So is the Earth . So is a polluted Earth.
Martin Rees has recently written a book about our vulnerability to all sorts of things , from astrophysics , to scientific experiments gone wrong , and most importantly to terrorism with weapons of mass destruction.
But I do agree with him about this . We can survive , and we can fail to survive.
And if we want to be the exception to that , then logically our only hope is to make use of the one feature that distinguishes our species , and our civilization , from all the others -- namely , our special relationship with the laws of physics , our ability to create new explanations , new knowledge -- to be a hub of existence.
Because if it ' s true that our best option at the moment is to prevent CO2 emissions with something like the Kyoto Protocol , with its constraints on economic activity and its enormous cost of hundreds of billions of dollars or whatever it is , then that is already a disaster by any reasonable measure.
It is that we can ' t always know . When we know of an impending disaster , and how to solve it at a cost less than the cost of the disaster itself , then there ' s not going to be much argument , really.
If you ' ve been punched on the nose , then the science of medicine does not consist of teaching you how to avoid punches.
At the moment , these things are fringe research.
On one of them , carve :  " Problems are soluble. " 
How can a struggling country break out of poverty if it ' s trapped in a system of bad rules ?  Economist Paul Romer unveils a bold idea :  " charter cities, "  city-scale administrative zones governed by a coalition of nations.
Take a look at this picture.
Let ' s just pick one -- for example , the one in the green shirt.
Why is it that Nelson has access to a cutting-edge technology , like the cellphone , but doesn ' t have access to a 100-year-old technology for generating electric light in the home ? 
The electric company in this nation operates under a rule , which says that it has to sell electricity at a very low , subsidized price -- in fact , a price that is so low it loses money on every unit that it sells.
That ' s the kind of rules that the cellphone company that Nelson purchases his telephony from operates under.
And Nelson is stuck studying under the streetlights.
But , it ' s useful to present the opposition between these two.
But if we can find ways to give more choices to both , that will give us a set of rules for changing rules that get us out of traps.
If you zoom in here , you can see North Korea , in outline here , which is like a black hole compared to its neighbors.
So we can change -- we as humans can change the rules that we use to interact with each other , for better , or for worse.
Both of these countries are dark compared to Puerto Rico , which has half as many residents as either Haiti or the Dominican Republic.
We ' ve got to find ways to build up , as well.
But the Chinese never adopted , at least in that period , effective rules for encouraging the spread of those ideas -- a profit motive that could have encouraged the spread.
This next chart looks at more recent data.
Growth took off in China . The Chinese started catching up very quickly with the United States.
In the 1950s , Hong Kong was a place where millions of people could go , from the mainland , to start in jobs like sewing shirts , making toys.
So instead of forcing everyone in China to shift immediately to the market model , they proceeded by creating some special zones that could do , in a sense , what Britain did : make the opportunity to go work with the market rules available to the people who wanted to opt in there.
So after the four special zones , there were 14 coastal cites that were open in the same sense , and eventually demonstrated successes in these places that people could opt in to , that they flocked to because of the advantages they offered.
Two : operate on the right scale.
But cities give you this opportunity to create new places , with new rules that people can opt in to.
We ' ll need to attract the investors who will build out the infrastructure -- the power system , the roads , the port , the airport , the buildings.
The city can be built.
Those are captured in the charter.
People can come live under the new charter , but no one is forced to live under it.
So if we allow for these kind of partnerships to replicate this again , we can get those kinds of benefits scaled throughout the world.
Why is this not like colonialism ? 
So let ' s talk about how this could play out in practice.
There is a zone there , around Guantanamo Bay , where a treaty gives the United States administrative responsibility for a piece of land that ' s about twice the size of Manhattan.
Build -- run a special administrative zone.
Some of my citizens will move into that city as well.
Many of them totally get the notion of a special zone that people can opt into as a rule.
Perhaps even in some arrangement that ' s a little bit like an escrow account , where you put land in the escrow account and the partner nation takes responsibility for it.
Now , if we generalize this and think about not just one or two charter cites , but dozens -- cities that will help create places for the many hundreds of millions , perhaps billions of people who will move to cities in the coming century -- is there enough land for them ? 
Turn it into a square that stands for all the arable land on Earth.
We ' d go from three percent of the arable land , to four percent.
Their kids can get an education.
You wouldn ' t want to let us run the cities , go out and design them.
How would we write the treaty to do that ? 
You could use the gains on the value of the land to pay for things like the police , the courts , but the school system and the health care system too , which make this a more attractive place to live , makes this a place where people have higher incomes -- which , incidentally , makes the land more valuable.
Many technical details to be worked out , but those of us who are already starting to pursue these things can already tell that there is no roadblock , there ' s no impediment , other than a failure of imagination , that will keep us from delivering on a truly global win-win solution.
It ' s not like scarce objects , where sharing means we each get less.
Let ' s have a system where we have ownership of land that is registered in a government office , that people can pledge as collateral.

And this will be my only comment on it.
That took a genome project from 13 years down to four months.
We just got a grant from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation to sequence 130 genomes this year , as a side project from environmental organisms.
And maybe it ' s something that people in Oxford don ' t do very often , but if you ever make it to the sea , and you swallow a mouthful of seawater , keep in mind that each milliliter has about a million bacteria and on the order of 10 million viruses.
It ' s very tough duty ; we ' re doing this on a sailing vessel , in part to help excite young people about going into science.
For example , it was thought that the visual pigments that are in our eyes -- there was only one or two organisms in the environment that had these same pigments.
We ' re measuring how many viruses and bacteria all of us are breathing in and out every day , particularly on airplanes or closed auditoriums.
Some of these make logical sense , in terms of different temperature gradients.
Maybe not surprisingly , in the deep ocean , where it ' s mostly blue , the photoreceptors tend to see blue light.
And we tried to put these into gene families to see what these discoveries are : Are we just discovering new members of known families , or are we discovering new families ? 
Of those roughly 29 million genes , we only have around 24,000 in our genome.
Synthetic DNA , the ability to synthesize DNA , has changed at sort of the same pace that DNA sequencing has over the last decade or two , and is getting very rapid and very cheap.
But it has roughly 500 genes.
Transposons are just small pieces of DNA that randomly insert in the genetic code.
We also tried to take a more directly intellectual approach with the genomes of 13 related organisms , and we tried to compare all of those , to see what they had in common.
The only way to prove these ideas was to construct an artificial chromosome with those genes in them , and we had to do this in a cassette-based fashion.
This was not the first synthetic virus -- a polio virus had been made a year before -- but it was only one ten-thousandth as active and it took three years to do.
And I think it ' s important to keep reality in mind , versus what happens with people ' s imaginations.
The real concern that security departments have is designer viruses.
And possibly eukaryotic cells , those that we have , are possible within a decade.
This is derived from an organism , deinococcus radiodurans , that can take three million rads of radiation and not be killed.
The glass started to burn and crack , while the microbes sitting in the bottom just got happier and happier.
It ' s truly stunning that these organisms can do that , and we probably have thousands , if not tens of thousands , of different species on this planet that are capable of doing that.
So we know lots of different pathways , thousands of different organisms now that live off of CO2 , and can capture that back.
And DuPont has a major program with Statoil in Norway to capture and convert the methane from the gas fields there into useful products.
We ' re trying to modify photosynthesis to produce hydrogen directly from sunlight.
The chemistry from compounds in the environment is orders of magnitude more complex than our best chemists can produce.
Every major religion participated in this.
Except for the threat of bio-terrorism , they ' re very simple issues in terms of , can we design things to produce clean energy , perhaps revolutionizing what developing countries can do and provide through various simple processes.

Keep it quiet please . Settle down.
Philip Zimbardo : Let ' s tune into the conversation of the principals in Adam ' s temptation.
I don ' t want to get in trouble. " 
Of teenage girls who pledged sexual abstinence and virginity until marriage -- thank you George Bush -- the majority , 60 percent , yielded to sexual temptations within one year.
They can have one marshmallow now . But if they wait until the experimenter comes back , they can have two.
They resist the temptation . They delay the now for later.
That ' s enormous . That ' s like a whole set of different IQ points.
Time perspective is the study of how individuals , all of us , divide the flow of your human experience into time zones or time categories.
What determines any decision you make ? 
For others , the present is irrelevant.
For others it ' s not the past , it ' s not the present , it ' s only about the future.
So , time paradox , I want to argue , the paradox of time perspective , is something that influences every decision you make , you ' re totally unaware of.
You can focus on past-positive , or past-negative.
Developing the mental flexibility to shift time perspectives fluidly depending on the demands of the situation , that ' s what you ' ve got to learn to do.
And always low on past-negative and present-fatalism.
Any time perspective in excess has more negatives than positives.
They sacrifice hobbies . And they sacrifice sleep . So it affects their health.
I ' m here as a future-oriented person who went over the top , who did all these sacrifices because teachers intervened , and made me future oriented.
So I want to end by saying : many of life ' s puzzles can be solved by understanding your time perspective and that of others.
How many of today ' s headlines will matter in 100 years ?  1000 ?  Kirk Citron ' s  " Long News "  project collects stories that not only matter today , but will resonate for decades -- even centuries -- to come . At TED2010 , he highlights recent headlines with the potential to shape our future.
We are drowning in news.
That ' s the idea behind The Long News.
To take the top stories from the A.P . this last year , is this going to matter in a decade ? 
Okay , that was kind of cool.
Someday , little robots will go through our bloodstreams fixing things.
We ' re having trouble feeding six billion today.
What about global politics ? 
Some recent discoveries : There ' s an ant colony from Argentina that has now spread to every continent but Antarctica ; there ' s a self-directed robot scientist that ' s made a discovery -- soon , science may no longer need us , and life may no longer need us either ; a microbe wakes up after 120,000 years.
And if NASA doesn ' t do it , China might , or somebody in this room might write a big check.

And it ' s a journey that you and I have been on for many years now , and it began some 50 years ago , when humans first stepped off our planet.
Now , the Saturn system is a rich planetary system.
And then , here ' s a beautiful composite of the Whirlpool Galaxy , taken by the Hubble Space Telescope.
So I ' m going to concentrate on two of the most exciting stories that have emerged out of this major exploratory expedition that we are conducting around Saturn , and have been for the past two and a half years.
Now , two of the 47 moons that Saturn has are standouts.
Its atmosphere is largely molecular nitrogen , like you are breathing here in this room , except that its atmosphere is suffused with simple organic materials like methane and propane and ethane.
But these haze particles , it was surmised , before we got there with Cassini , over billions and billions of years , gently drifted down to the surface and coated the surface in a thick organic sludge.
It ' s a condensable in the atmosphere , and so recognizing this circumstance brought to the fore a whole world of bizarre possibilities . You can have methane clouds , OK , and above those clouds , you have this hundreds of kilometers of haze , which prevent any sunlight from getting to the surface.
It can wash the sludge off high mountain peaks and hills , down into the lowlands . So stop and think for a minute.
That is the view that we had of the surface of Titan before we got there with Cassini , and I can tell you that what we have found on Titan , though it is not the same in detail , is every bit as fascinating as that story is.
And yet another moon there -- I don ' t even know which one it is . It ' s a very extensive atmosphere.
It was so mystifying : we couldn ' t make out what we were seeing on Titan.
They look like they ' ve been pulled apart.
And that was the deployment of the Huygens probe , the European-built Huygens probe that Cassini had carried for seven years across the solar system . We deployed it to the atmosphere of Titan , it took two and a half hours to descend , and it landed on the surface.
.
So it was -- I mean , I ' m getting goose bumps just talking about it.
And I can ' t tell you what it was like to see the first pictures of Titan ' s surface from the probe . And this is what we saw.
And you can follow these channels and you can see how they all converge.
But this is somewhat of a shoreline.
If you were going to take an airplane trip across the U.S. , you would be flying at these altitudes.
These are probably water ice pebbles , yes ? 
And it ' s probably the case that this material has washed off the highlands of Titan through these channels that we saw , and has drained over billions of years to fill in low-lying basins.
OK , so this is our movie of the equatorial region of Titan , showing these dunes . These are dunes that are 100 meters tall , separated by a few kilometers , and they go on for miles and miles and miles.
So again , it got puzzling that there were no bodies of fluid , until finally , we saw lakes in the polar regions.
So it seems that the liquids , for some reason we don ' t understand , or during at least this season , are apparently at the poles of Titan.
It is a very geologically active body.
Moreover , this whole , entire region , the south polar region , has elevated temperatures . It ' s the hottest place on the planet , on the body.
My team and I have examined images like this , and like this one , and have thought about the other results from Cassini.
And I don ' t think I need to tell you that the discovery of life elsewhere in our solar system , whether it be on Enceladus or elsewhere , would have enormous cultural and scientific implications.
And if any of you were alert and coherent during the 1960s -- and we ' d forgive you , if you weren ' t , OK -- you would remember this very famous picture taken by the Apollo 8 astronauts in 1968.
And in this impossibly beautiful picture , you see the main rings backlit by the Sun , you see the refracted image of the Sun and you see this ring created , in fact , by the exhalations of Enceladus.

Lalitesh Katragadda : Making maps to fight disaster , build economies
But there were no maps , no maps of roads , no maps showing hospitals , no way for help to reach the cyclone victims.
At Google , 40 volunteers used a new software to map 120,000 kilometers of roads , 3,000 hospitals , logistics and relief points.
People have used this software to map everything from roads to rivers , from schools to local businesses , and video stores to the corner store.
In the last year alone , thousands of users in 170 countries have mapped millions of pieces of information , and created a map of a level of detail never thought viable.
You can see Bridget in Africa who just mapped a road in Senegal.
This is an invitation to the 70 percent of our unmapped planet.

For the last 8 years , I have dedicated my life to documenting the work of Israelis and Palestinians who are trying to end the conflict using peaceful means.
These leaders are trying to forge a massive national nonviolent movement to end the occupation and build peace in the region.
I believe that what ' s mostly missing for nonviolence to grow is not for Palestinians to start adopting nonviolence , but for us to start paying attention to those who already are.
Through inspired local leadership , they launched a peaceful resistance campaign to stop that from happening.
Israeli Man : The fence has , in fact , created a solution to terror.
Woman : We saw the men trying to push the soldiers , but none of them could do that.
Chanting : One united nation.
They were allowed to use any force necessary.
But there were others around me who weren ' t even cowering.
Chanting : We can do it! We can do it!
The residents , after 10 months of peaceful resistance , convinced the Israeli government to move the route of the barrier off their lands and to the green line , which is the internationally recognized boundary between Israel and the Palestinian Territories.
Violent resistance and nonviolent resistance share one very important thing in common ; they are both a form of theater seeking an audience to their cause.
The tantrum will become what childhood psychologists call a functional behavior , since the child has learned that he can get parental attention out of it.
I believe that at the core of ending the conflict in the Middle East and bringing peace is for us to transform nonviolence into a functional behavior by giving a lot more attention to the nonviolent leaders on the ground today.
They had been using nonviolence for about two years but had grown disenchanted since nobody was paying attention.
So they kept on going.
The examples of Wallajeh and the Solidariot movement show that even a small-budget independent film can play a role in transforming nonviolence into a functional behavior.
If they multiply , their influence will grow in the overall Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

Simon Sinek : How great leaders inspire action
Year after year , after year , after year , they ' re more innovative than all their competition.
Then why is it that they seem to have something different ? 
And why is it that the Wright brothers were able to figure out controlled , powered man flight when there were certainly other teams who were better qualified , better funded ...
And this discovery profoundly changed my view on how I thought the world worked , and it even profoundly changed the way in which I operate in it.
All I did was codify it , and it ' s probably the world ' s simplest idea.
Let me define the terms really quickly.
And by  " why "  I don ' t mean  " to make a profit. " 
Why does your organization exist ? 
It ' s obvious . We go from the clearest thing to the fuzziest thing.
If Apple were like everyone else , a marketing message from them might sound like this :  " We make great computers.
That ' s how most marketing is done , that ' s how most sales is done and that ' s how most of us communicate interpersonally.
But it ' s uninspiring.
The way we challenge the status quo is by making our products beautifully designed , simple to use and user friendly.
All I did was reverse the order of the information.
But we ' re also perfectly comfortable buying an MP3 player from Apple , or a phone from Apple , or a DVR from Apple.
In fact , they tried.
Nobody bought one.
But we do it every day.
It ' s all grounded in the tenets of biology.
The neocortex is responsible for all of our rational and analytical thought and language.
It just doesn ' t drive behavior.
Why would we use that verb , it doesn ' t  " feel "  right ? 
Well , I hate to break it to you , those aren ' t other body parts controlling your behavior.
The goal is not just to hire people who need a job ; it ' s to hire people who believe what you believe.
And back in the early 20th century , the pursuit of powered man flight was like the dot com of the day.
and people always give you the same permutation of the same three things : under-capitalized , the wrong people , bad market conditions.
He held a seat at Harvard and worked at the Smithsonian and was extremely well-connected ; he knew all the big minds of the day.
A few hundred miles away in Dayton Ohio , Orville and Wilbur Wright , they had none of what we consider to be the recipe for success.
Samuel Pierpont Langley was different.
And lo and behold , look what happened.
And , eventually , on December 17th , 1903 , the Wright brothers took flight , and no one was there to even experience it.
He wasn ' t first , he didn ' t get rich , he didn ' t get famous so he quit.
Something called the law of diffusion of innovation , and if you don ' t know the law , you definitely know the terminology.
The only reason these people buy touch tone phones is because you can ' t buy rotary phones anymore.
Well , you can trip over 10 percent of the customers.
The problem is : How do you find the ones that get it before you ' re doing business with them versus the ones who don ' t get it ? 
These are the people who stood in line for six hours to buy an iPhone when they first came out , when you could have just walked into the store the next week and bought one off the shelf.
People don ' t buy what you do ; they buy why you do it and what you do simply proves what you believe.
So let me give you a famous example , a famous failure and a famous success of the law of diffusion of innovation.
Look at TiVo.
I mean , we use TiVo as verb.
And when they went IPO , their stock was at about 30 or 40 dollars and then plummeted , and it ' s never traded above 10.
And the cynical majority said ,  " We don ' t believe you.
It pauses live TV , skips commercials , memorizes your viewing habits , etc. , etc. " 
They sent out no invitations , and there was no website to check the date.
In fact , some of his ideas were bad.
 " I believe , I believe , I believe, "  he told people.
How many of them showed up for him ? 
It ' s what they believed , and it wasn ' t about black versus white : 25 percent of the audience was white.
We followed , not for him , but for ourselves.
Because there are leaders and there are those who lead.
And it ' s those who start with  " why "  that have the ability to inspire those around them or find others who inspire them.
brain,cognitive science,exploration,neuroscience,science
Here ' s the problem facing Homer.
It ' s named after Latin for  " seahorse, "  which it resembles.
The hippocampus is formed of two sheets of cells , which are very densely interconnected.
So what we see is that this neuron knows whenever the rat has gone into one particular place in its environment.
So together they form a map for the rest of the brain , telling the brain continually ,  " Where am I now within my environment ?  " 
And place cells in their hippocampi would fire , become active , start sending electrical impulses whenever they drove through a particular location in that town.
And when you expand the box , the firing location expands.
And indeed , on the inputs to the hippocampus , cells are found which project into the hippocampus , which do respond exactly to detecting boundaries or edges at particular distances and directions from the rat or mouse as it ' s exploring around.
We can also test where we think objects are , like this goal flag , in simple environments -- or indeed , where your car would be.
In that case , we can see how where they think the flag had been changes as a function of how you change the shape and size of the environment.
But we also know where we are through movement.
But now as the rat explores around , each individual cell fires in a whole array of different locations which are laid out across the environment in an amazingly regular triangular grid.
And as it moves around , the electrical activity can pass from one of these cells to the next cell to keep track of where it is , so that it can use its own movements to know where it is in its environment.
And indeed , you do see it in the human entorhinal cortex , which is the same part of the brain that you see grid cells in rats.
He ' s also remembering the path he took out of the car park , which would be represented in the firing of grid cells.
Maybe it ' s been towed.
So if this was happening , your memories could start by place cells activating each other via these dense interconnections and then reactivating boundary cells to create the spatial structure of the scene around your viewpoint.
So this is just one example of a new era really in cognitive neuroscience where we ' re beginning to understand psychological processes like how you remember or imagine or even think in terms of the actions of the billions of individual neurons that make up our brains.

This is Verdun , a battlefield in France just north of the NATO headquarters in Belgium.
We go from the trench warfare of the First World War to the Maginot Line of the Second World War , and then we go into the Cold War , the Iron Curtain , the Berlin Wall.
It ' s in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
So let me talk a little bit about why we need to do that , because our global commons is under attack in a variety of ways , and none of the sources of threat to the global commons will be solved by building walls.
It ' s got concertina wire along the sides of it.
It ' s active in the Gulf of Guinea.
This is an attack on the global commons.
At the moment , they ' re incarcerated.
That ' s just under the GDP of Great Britain.
We worry about the movement of illegal weapons and trafficking . Above all , perhaps , we worry about human trafficking , and the awful cost of it.
It was built in the jungles of South America.
And let ' s pull it together in Afghanistan today.
This is where al Qaeda is staged from.
We know our 20th-century tools are not going to work.
We will need the application of military force.
This is Afghanistan . These are Afghan soldiers.
Eighty-five percent cannot read when they enter the security forces of Afghanistan.
We ' ve taught well over 200,000 Afghan Security Forces to read and write at a basic level.
Now , we are also teaching them combat skills , of course , but I would argue , open-source security means connecting in ways that create longer lasting security effect.
There ' s a sister ship called the Mercy.
It is crewed not strictly by military but by a combination of humanitarian organizations : Operation Hope , Project Smile.
To give you one example of the impact this can have , this little boy , eight years old , walked with his mother two days to come to the eye clinic put on by the Comfort.
Here you see baseball players.
Another aspect of this partnership is in disaster relief.
We tie it together , increasingly , by doing things like this.
White is the synthesis.
We talked earlier about the Arab Spring , and the power of all this.
There was an article which was run by AP , on the wire.
Which I do.
Now , let me hit a somber note.
I put him here to remind us , I would not want anyone to leave the room thinking that we do not need capable , competent militaries who can create real military effect.
I would argue life is a rheostat.
It ' s a perfect image for the fundamental point that no one of us is as smart as all of us thinking together.
Thank you.
